**Sanctuary**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature,
even with a targeted spell, must attempt a
[Will] save. If the save succeeds, the
opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of
the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through
with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't
directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the
spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain
unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from
being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject
cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack
spells or otherwise act.

Scare

**Scare**

**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a bone from an undead creature)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one living creature per three levels, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text for *cause fear*

**Saving Throw**[Will] partial; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

This spell functions like *cause fear,*except that it causes all
targeted creatures of less than 6 HD to become
[frightened].

Scintillating Pattern

**Scintillating Pattern**

**School** illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a crystal prism)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** colorful lights in a 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** concentration + 2 rounds

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A twisting pattern of coruscating colors weaves through the air,
affecting creatures within. The spell affects a total number of
HD of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20).
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first, and among
creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's
point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to
affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject
according to its HD.

*6 or less*: [Unconscious] for 1d4
rounds, then [stunned] for 1d4 rounds,
and then *[confused]*for 1d4 rounds.
 result as
[stunned] for nonliving creatures.)

*7 to 12*: [Stunned] for 1d4 rounds,
then *[confused]*for an additional
1d4 rounds.

*13 or more*:*[Confused]*for 1d4
rounds.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *scintillating pattern*.

Scorching Ray

**Scorching Ray**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one or more rays

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire
one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd
(to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a
ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.
The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all
rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and
fired simultaneously.

Screen

**Screen**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 30-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** 24 hours

**Saving Throw** none or [Will] disbelief
(if interacted with); see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and
observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and
will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created
must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set,
they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically
detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and
sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation
may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to
disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel
the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden
beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the
illusion.

Scrying

**Scrying**

**School** divination (scrying); **Level** bard 3, cleric 5,
druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a pool of water), F (a silver mirror
worth 1,000 gp)

**Range** see text

**Effect**magical sensor

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject
succeeds on a [Will] save, the spell fails.
The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of
the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you
have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another
plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its [Will]
save.

Knowledge

[Will] Save Modifier

None\*

+10

Secondhand (you have heard of the subject)

+5

Firsthand (you have met the subject)

+0

Familiar (you know the subject well)

–5

Connection

[Will] Save Modifier

Likeness or picture

–2

Possession or garment

–4

Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.

\*You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature
of which you have no knowledge.

If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its
surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the
subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of
up to 150 feet.

As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full
visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the
following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating
through the sensor: *[detect
chaos]*, *[detect
evil]*, *[detect
good]*, *[detect
law]*, *[detect
magic]*, and
*[message]*.

If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject
again for at least 24 hours.

**Scrying, Greater**

**School** divination (scrying); **Level** bard 6, cleric 7,
druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Duration** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like *[scrying]*, except as noted
above. Additionally, all of the following spells function
reliably through the sensor: *[detect
chaos]*, *[detect
evil]*, *[detect
good]*, *[detect
law]*, *[detect
magic]*,
*[message]*, *[read

*[tongues]*.

Sculpt Sound

**Sculpt Sound**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature or object/level, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can
create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform
sounds into other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must
be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation is made,
you cannot change it. You can change the qualities of sounds but
cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself.

A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to
cast spells with verbal components.

Searing Light

**Searing Light**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast
of light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch
attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of
light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum
5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly
vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster
level (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only
1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).

Secret Chest

**Secret Chest**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, F (the chest and its replica)

**Range** see text

**Target** one chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level

**Duration** 60 days or until discharged

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and
can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot
of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual
size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living
creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell
simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by
concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.

The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive,
constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest
is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must
make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every
detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a
perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are
nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just
as any normal chest can be.

To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the
chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal
Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days,
there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is
irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or
destroyed, there is no way, even with a
*[wish]*spell, that the large chest can be
summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be
mounted to find it.

Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they
die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to
survive.

Secret Page

**Secret Page**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (powdered herring scales and a vial of
will-o'-wisp essence)

**Range** touch

**Target** page touched, up to 3 sq. ft. in size

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

S*ecret page*alters the contents of a page so that it appears to
be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be
changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by
the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained
on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. *[Explosive
runes]*or *[sepia snake
sigil]*can be cast upon
the *secret page.*

A *[comprehend
languages]*spell
alone cannot reveal a *secret page*'s contents. You are able to
reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can
then peruse the actual page and return it to its *secret
page*form at will. You can also remove the spell by double
repetition of the special word. A *[detect
magic]*spell reveals dim magic on
the page in question but does not reveal its true contents.
*[True seeing]*reveals the presence
of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless
cast in combination with *[comprehend
languages].*A
*secret page*spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can
be destroyed by means of an *erase*spell.

Secure Shelter

**Secure Shelter**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a chip of stone, sand, a drop of water,
and a wood splinter)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 20-ft.-square structure

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is
common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level,
clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a
sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat
adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does,
however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong
as a normal stone building, regardless of its material
composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were
stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast
by siege engines or giants).

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against
intrusion, the former two being secured with *[arcane
lock]*and the latter by an iron
grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three
areas are protected by an *alarm*spell. Finally, an *unseen
servant*is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of
the shelter.

The *secure shelter*contains crude furnishings—eight bunks, a
trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

See Invisibility

**See Invisibility**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (talc and powdered silver)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

You can see any objects or beings that are
[invisible] within your range of
vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were
normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as
translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference
between visible, [invisible], and
ethereal creatures.

The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility.
It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque
objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding,
concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

*See invisibility*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Seeming

**Seeming**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature per two levels, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 12 hours (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates or
[Will] disbelief (if interacted with);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes or
no; see text

This spell functions like *[disguise
self]*, except that you can
change the appearance of other people as well. Affected creatures
resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can
negate the spell's effect on them by making
[Will] saves or with [spell
resistance].

Sending

**Sending**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M/DF (fine copper wire)

**Range** see text

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and
send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The
subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like
manner immediately. A creature with an
[Intelligence] score as low
as 1 can understand the *sending,*though the subject's ability to
react is limited as normal by its
[Intelligence]. Even if the
*sending*is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it
in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence
as you are, there is a 5% chance that the *sending*does not
arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance
considerably.)

Sepia Snake Sigil

**Sepia Snake Sigil**

**School** conjuration (creation) [force]; **Level** bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (powdered amber worth 500 gp and a snake
scale)

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched book or written work

**Duration** permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4
days + 1 day/level; see text

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** no

You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work.
The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long.
When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the *sepia
snake sigil*springs into being, transforming into a large sepia
serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of
effect between the symbol and the reader.

Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the
spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is
entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds,
the *sepia snake*dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied
by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target
fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of
force and immobilized until released, either at your command or
when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.

While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not
age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is
preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its
surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps
even killed), since the field provides no protection against
physical injury. However, a [dying]
subject does not lose hit points or become
[stable] until the spell ends.

The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and
*[detect magic]*reveals only that
the entire text is magical.

A *[dispel magic]*can remove the
sigil. An *erase*spell destroys the entire page of text.

*Sepia snake sigil*can be cast in combination with other spells
that hide or garble text, such as *[secret
page].*

Sequester

**Sequester**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a basilisk eyelash and gum arabic)

**Range** touch

**Target** one willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft.
cube/level) touched

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none or [Will] negates
(object); **[Spell
Resistance]** no or yes
(object)

When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting
or locating the target and also renders the affected target
[invisible] (as the
*[invisibility]*spell). The
spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through
tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected
by *sequester*become comatose and are effectively in a state of
suspended animation until the spell ends.

*Note*: The [Will] save prevents an
attended or magical object from being *sequestered.*There is no
save to see the *sequestered*creature or object or to detect it
with a divination spell.

Shades

**Shades**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions like *[shadow
conjuration],*except
that it mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The
illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to
nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work
against nonbelievers.

Shadow Conjuration

**Shadow Conjuration**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** see text

**Effect** see text

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief (if
interacted with); varies; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes; see text

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real
illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. *Shadow
conjuration*can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration
(summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or
lower.

*Shadow conjurations*are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the
real things, though creatures who believe the *shadow
conjurations*to be real are affected by them at full strength.
Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a
[Will] save to recognize its true nature.

Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected
creature succeeds on a [Will] save. Each
disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the
attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than
damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of
the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is
also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but
the save DC is set according to *shadow conjuration*'s level
(4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any
effect created by *shadow conjuration*allows [spell
resistance], even if the
spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances
have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them.
Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.

A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal
creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as
shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and
weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow
creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth
(20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal
damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each
affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow
creature's [AC] bonuses are just
one-fifth as large.

A creature that succeeds on its save sees the *shadow
conjurations*as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy
forms. Objects automatically succeed on their
[Will] saves against this spell.

**Shadow Conjuration, Greater**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions like *[shadow
conjuration],*except that it duplicates any
sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration
(creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations
created deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and
nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.

Shadow Evocation

**Shadow Evocation**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** see text

**Effect** see text

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief (if
interacted with); **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real,
illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th
level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects
unless an affected creature succeeds on a
[Will] save. Each disbelieving creature
takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved
attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is
one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur.
If recognized as a *shadow evocation,*a damaging spell deals only
one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to
disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or
[spell resistance]) that the
spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to
*shadow evocation'*s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal
level.

Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who
disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.

Objects automatically succeed on their
[Will] saves against this spell.

**Shadow Evocation, Greater**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions like *[shadow
evocation],*except that it enables you to
create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard
evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a
*greater shadow evocation*, a damaging spell deals only
three-fifths (60%) damage.

Shadow Walk

**Shadow Walk**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Targets** up to one touched creature/level

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

To use the *shadow walk*spell, you must be in an area of dim
light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along
a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane
where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely
illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one
creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all
must be touching each other.

In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour,
moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much
more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use
this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of
Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto
the Material Plane.

Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow
and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain
or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict
perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge
distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for
scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you
are shunted 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from
your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid
object, you are shunted 1d10 × 1,000 feet in the same direction.
If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any
creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space
available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature
[fatigued] (no save).

*Shadow walk*can also be used to travel to other planes that
border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the
transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another
plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4
hours.

Any creatures touched by you when *shadow walk*is cast also make
the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.

They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or
stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of
the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you).
Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow
receive a [Will] saving throw, negating the
effect if successful.

Shambler

**Shambler**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** druid 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** three or more shambling mounds, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart; see text

**Duration** 7 days or 7 months (D); see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

The *shambler*spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the
advanced template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or
battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The
creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If
the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the
duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers
can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location.
Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's
range, which is measured from the point where each first
appeared. You can only have one *shambler* spell in effect at one
time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in
effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have
resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the
terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.

Shapechange

**Shapechange**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**druid 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, F (jade circlet worth 1,500 gp)

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**10 min./level (D)

This spell allows you to take the form of a wide variety of
creatures. This spell can function as *[alter
self], [beast shape
IV],
[elemental body IV], [form
of the dragon III],
[giant form II],*and *[plant shape
III]* depending on what form
you take. You can change form once each round as a free action.
The change takes place either immediately before your regular
action or immediately after it, but not during the action.

Shatter

**Shatter**

**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a chip of mica)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area or Target** 5-ft.-radius spread; or one solid object or
one crystalline creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
[Will] negates (object) or
[Fortitude] half; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

*Shatter*creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle,
nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or
damages a crystalline creature.

Used as an area attack, *shatter*destroys nonmagical objects of
crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended
objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed
into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1
pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of
the appropriate composition are shattered.

Alternatively, you can target *shatter*against a single solid
nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10
pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature
(of any weight), *shatter*deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per
caster level (maximum 10d6), with a
[Fortitude] save for half damage.

Shield

**Shield**

**School** abjuration [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

*Shield*creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front
of you. It negates *[magic
missile]*attacks directed at
you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to
[AC]. This bonus applies against
[incorporeal] touch attacks, since
it is a force effect. The *shield*has no armor check penalty or
arcane spell failure chance.

Shield of Faith

**Shield of Faith**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (parchment with a holy text written on it)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the target
that averts and deflects attacks. The spell grants the subject a
+2 deflection bonus to [AC], with an
additional +1 to the bonus for every six levels you have (maximum
+5 deflection bonus at 18th level).

Shield of Law

**Shield of Law**

**School** abjuration [lawful]; **Level** cleric 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a reliquary worth 500 gp)

**Range** 20 ft.

**Targets** one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered
on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from
attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic
creatures, and *slowing*chaotic creatures when they strike the
subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to
[AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on
saves. Unlike *[protection from
chaos]*, this
benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by
chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains [spell
resistance] 25 against
chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental
influence, just as *[protection from
chaos]*does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against
a warded creature, the attacker is
*slowed*([Will] save negates, as the
*[slow]*spell, but against *shield of law*'s
save DC).

Shield Other

**Shield Other**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a pair of platinum rings worth 50 gp worn
by both you and the target)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection
between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are
transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to
[AC] and a +1 resistance bonus on
saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all
wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities)
that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the
warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not
involve hit points, such as *charm*effects, temporary ability
damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If
the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered
[Constitution] score, the
reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point
damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer
divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is
not reassigned to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each
other, the spell ends.

Shillelagh

**Shillelagh**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched nonmagical oak club or quarterstaff

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a
+1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A quarterstaff
gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon. It deals
damage as if it were two size categories larger (a Small club or
quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium
2d6, and a Large 3d6), +1 for its enhancement bonus. These
effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do
not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.

Shocking Grasp

**Shocking Grasp**

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature or object touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of
electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When
delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the
opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or
is made of metal).

Shout

**Shout**

**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] partial
or [Reflex] negates (object); see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures
in its path. Any creature within the area is
[deafened] for 2d6 rounds and takes
5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the
deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or
crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of
sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected
creature is allowed a [Fortitude] save
to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile
objects can negate damage to them with a successful
[Reflex] save. A *shout*spell cannot
penetrate a *[silence]*spell.

**Shout, Greater**

**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components**: V, S, F (a metal or ivory horn)

**Range** 60 ft.

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] partial
or [Reflex] negates (object); see text

This spell functions like *[shout],*except that the cone
deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage
per caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or
crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes
creatures to be [stunned] for 1 round
and [deafened] for 4d6 rounds. A
creature in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and
halve both the damage and the duration of the deafness with a
successful [Fortitude] save. A
creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a
[Reflex] save to negate the damage to
those objects.

Shrink Item

**Shrink Item**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object of up to 2 cu. ft./level

**Duration** 1 day/level; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the
size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to
about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change
effectively reduces the object's size by four categories.
Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a
clothlike one. Objects changed by a *shrink item*spell can be
returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them
onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original
caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this
spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and
composition ends the spell.

*Shrink item*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell, in which case
the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite
number of times, but only by the original caster.

Silence

**Silence**

**School**illusion (glamer); **Level**bard 2, cleric 2

**Casting Time**1 round

**Components**V, S

**Range**long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area**20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object,
or point in space

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**: [Will] negates; see text
or none (object); **[Spell
Resistance]**: yes; see text
or no (object)

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the
affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible,
spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise
whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The
spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is
stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be
centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the
creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt
a [Will] save to negate the spell and can
use [spell resistance], if
any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit
sound receive the benefits of saves and [spell
resistance], but unattended
objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a
*silence*spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks,
spells, and effects.

Silent Image

**Silent Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard
1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a bit of fleece)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft.
cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief (if
interacted with); **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or
force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound,
smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the
limits of the size of the effect.

Simulacrum

**Simulacrum**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 12 hours

**Components** V, S, M (ice sculpture of the target plus powdered
rubies worth 500 gp per HD of the simulacrum)

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** one duplicate creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Simulacrum*creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The
duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow.
It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half
of the real creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit
points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature
of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature
whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make
a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good
the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might
detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by
the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.

At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command.
No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised
in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more
powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced
to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and
melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at
least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped
magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.

Slay Living

**Slay Living**

**School** necromancy [death]; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] partial;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You can attempt to slay any one living creature. When you cast
this spell, your hand seethes with eerie dark fire. You must
succeed on a melee touch attack to touch the target. The target
takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. If the
target's [Fortitude] saving throw
succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per
caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it
succeeds on its saving throw.

Sleep

**Sleep**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (fine sand, rose petals, or a live
cricket)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** one or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius
burst

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A *sleep*spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of
creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's
point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to
affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are
[helpless]. Slapping or wounding
awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the
aid another action). *Sleep*does not target
[unconscious] creatures,
constructs, or undead creatures.

Sleet Storm

**Sleet Storm**

**School** conjuration (creation) [cold]; **Level** druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (dust and water)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

Driving sleet blocks all sight (even
[darkvision]) within it and causes
the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or
through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10
Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round,
while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics
skill for details).

The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

Slow

**Slow**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed
rate. Creatures affected by this spell are
[staggered] and can take only a
single move action or standard action each turn, but not both
(nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a –1
penalty on attack rolls, [AC], and
[Reflex] saves. A *slowed*creature moves
at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot
increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as
normal for decreased speed.

Multiple *slow*effects don't stack. *Slow*counters and dispels
*[haste]*.

Snare

**Snare**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 3 rounds

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** touched nonmagical circle of vine, rope, or thong with
a 2 ft. diameter + 2 ft./level

**Duration** Until triggered or broken

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic
trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a
rope. When you cast *snare*upon it, the cordlike object blends
with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character
with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is
tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of
any creature stepping inside the circle.

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened
to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the
loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature
trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or
limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens
around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be
[entangled].

The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a
DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23
[Strength] check that is a
full-round action. The snare has
[AC] 7 and 5 hit points. A
successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the
spell.

Soften Earth and Stone

**Soften Earth and Stone**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 10-ft. square/level; see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in
the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry
earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay
that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square
area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or
resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted,
dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone
creatures are not affected.

A creature in mud must succeed on a
[Reflex] save or be caught for 1d2 rounds
and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that
succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and
it can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud,
but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal
speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened
into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters
to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to
affect before.

While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern
ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be
affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide
as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or
roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see
[Environment]).

A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a
manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it,
causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will
only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

Solid Fog

**Solid Fog**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Components**: V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

**Duration** 1 min./level

**[Spell Resistance]** no

This spell functions like *[fog cloud]*, but in
addition to obscuring sight, the *solid fog* is so thick that it
impedes movement. Creatures moving through a *solid fog* move at
half their normal speed and take a –2 penalty on all melee attack
and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged
weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature
or object that falls into *solid fog* is slowed so that each 10
feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage
by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in *solid
fog*. *Solid fog*, and effects that work like *solid fog*, do not
stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack
penalties.

Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these
vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

*Solid fog*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell. A permanent
*solid fog*dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

Song of Discord

**Song of Discord**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic];
**Level** bard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other
rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50%
chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to
determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning
of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest
neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced
by a *song of discord*to attack their fellows employ all methods
at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most
advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets
that have fallen [unconscious].

Soul Bind

**Soul Bind**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (see text)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** corpse

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a
black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than
1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem,
cannot be returned through *[clone], [raise
dead], reincarnation,
[resurrection], [true
resurrection],*or even
a *[miracle]*or a
*[wish].*Only by destroying the gem or
dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is
then still dead).

The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp
value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be
bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the
binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level
or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual
can be researched.)

Sound Burst

**Sound Burst**

**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a musical instrument)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 10-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] partial;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You blast an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in
the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a
[Fortitude] save to avoid being
[stunned] for 1 round. Creatures that
cannot hear are not [stunned] but are
still damaged.

Speak with Animals

**Speak with Animals**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 3, druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level

You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but
the spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary
and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the
more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly
toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.

Speak with Dead

**Speak with Dead**

**School** necromancy [language-dependent]; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 10 ft.

**Target** one dead creature

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** no

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to
answer questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels.
The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life,
including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or
repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in
life.

If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the
corpse gets a [Will] save to resist the
spell as if it were alive. If successful, the corpse can refuse
to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you, using Bluff.
The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot
answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after
its death.

If the corpse has been subject to *speak with dead*within the
past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a
corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the
body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged
corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct
answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at
all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned
into an undead creature.

Speak with Plants

**Speak with Plants**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 4, druid 3, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level

You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and
can ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal
plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able
to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or
answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The
spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or
cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant
creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more
stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is
friendly, it may do some favor or service for you.

Spectral Hand

**Spectral Hand**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** one spectral hand

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves
as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range
spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit
points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled),
but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed
as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell
of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the
*spectral hand*. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee
touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as
an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand
cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a
spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your
sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.

The hand is [incorporeal] and thus
cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half
damage on a failed [Reflex] save and no
damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an
[AC] of 22 (+8 size, +4 natural
armor). Your [Intelligence]
modifier applies to the hand's [AC]
as if it were the hand's
[Dexterity] modifier. The hand
has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating
it.

Spell Immunity

**Spell Immunity**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified
spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th
level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable
[spell resistance] regarding
the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't
protect a creature from spells for which [spell
resistance] doesn't apply.
*Spell immunity*protects against spells, spell-like effects of
magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It
does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities,
such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.

Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain
domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar
in effect. A creature can have only one *spell immunity*or
*greater spell immunity*spell in effect on it at a time.

**Spell Immunity, Greater**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 8

This spell functions like *[spell immunity]*,
except the immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A
creature can have only one *[spell immunity]*or
*greater spell immunity*spell in effect on it at a time.

Spell Resistance

**Spell Resistance**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The target gains [spell
resistance] equal to 12 +
your caster level.

Spellstaff

**Spellstaff**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, F (the staff that stores the spell)

**Range** touch

**Target**wooden quarterstaff touched

**Duration** permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden
quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a
given time, and you cannot have more than one *spellstaff*at any
given time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as
though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not
count against your normal allotment for a given day. You use up
any applicable material components required to cast the spell
when you store it in the *spellstaff.*

Spell Turning

**Spell Turning**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small silver mirror)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** until expended or 10 min./level

Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back
upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that
have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected.
*Spell turning*also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven
to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The
exact number is rolled secretly.

When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount
of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned.
Subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of
the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of
the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets
through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a
fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a
proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a
spellcasting attacker are both warded by *spell turning*effects
in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to
determine the result.

  d%       Effect
  -------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  01–70    Spell drains away without effect.
  71–80    Spell affects both of you equally at full effect.
  81–97    Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes.
  98–100   Both of you go through a rift into another plane.

Spider Climb

**Spider Climb**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a live spider)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even
traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature
must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject
gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb
skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to
traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A
*spider climbing*creature retains its
[Dexterity] bonus to [Armor
Class] (if any) while climbing, and
opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It
cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

Spike Growth

**Spike Growth**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** one 20-ft. square/level

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] partial;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very
hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.

In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way.
Typically, *spike growth*can be cast in any outdoor setting
except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone.
Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area
takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement
through the spiked area.

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed
on a [Reflex] save or suffer injuries to
its feet and legs that slow its land speed by half. This speed
penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives
a *cure*spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another
character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress
the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's
save DC.

Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the
Perception skill to find a *spike growth*. The DC is 25 + spell
level, or DC 28 for *spike growth*(or DC 27 for *spike
growth*cast by a ranger).*Spike growth*can't be disabled with the
Disable Device skill.

Spike Stones

**Spike Stones**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** one 20-ft. square/level

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] partial;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves
into long, sharp points that blend into the background.

*Spike stones*impede progress through an area and deal damage.
Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area
moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through
the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of
movement through the spiked area.

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed
on a [Reflex] save to avoid injuries to
its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to
be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured
creature receives a *cure*spell (which also restores lost hit
points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10
minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check
against the spell's save DC.

Magic traps such as *spike stones*are hard to detect. A rogue
(only) can use the Perception skill to find *spike stones*. The
DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for *spike stones*.*Spike
stones*is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable
Device skill.

Spiritual Weapon

**Spiritual Weapon**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect**magic weapon of force

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as
you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per
three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes
the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some
spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has
the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon
of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with
one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each
round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus
(possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent
rounds) plus your [Wisdom]
modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a
weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have [damage
reduction]. As a force
effect, it can strike
[incorporeal] creatures without
the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The
weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a
flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat
actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the
spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not
directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect
the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues
to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the
weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of
attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks
if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the
*spiritual weapon*is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not
the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still
is a move action.

A *spiritual weapon*cannot be attacked or harmed by physical
attacks, but *[dispel magic]*,
*[disintegrate]*, a *[sphere of
annihilation]*,
or a *[rod of
cancellation]*affects
it. A *spiritual weapon*'s [AC]
against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).

If an attacked creature has [spell
resistance], you make a
caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that [spell
resistance] the first time
the *spiritual weapon*strikes it. If the weapon is successfully
resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its
normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the
spell.

The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's
own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based
on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a
*spiritual weapon*of any alignment, provided he is acting at
least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The
weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos
(battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law
(longsword).

Stabilize

**Stabilize**

**School**conjuration (healing); **Level**cleric 0, druid 0

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: [Will] negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance]**: yes (harmless)

Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has –1
or fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized
and does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later
takes damage, it continues [dying]
normally.

Statue

**Statue**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred
by an iron spike)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

A *statue*spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any
garments and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the
subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points.
The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not
need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations
that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's
body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one
of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a
*statue*spell can return to its normal state, act, and then
return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if it so
desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.

Status

**Status**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Targets** one living creature touched per three levels

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated,
*status*allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions
and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to
the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed,
wounded, [disabled],
[staggered],
[unconscious],
[dying],
[nauseated],
[panicked],
[stunned], poisoned,
[diseased],
[confused]*,*or the like. Once the
spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them
and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on
the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if
it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

Stinking Cloud

**Stinking Cloud**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a rotten egg or cabbage leaves)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Stinking cloud*creates a bank of fog like that created by *[fog
cloud]*, except that the vapors are nauseating.
Living creatures in the cloud become
[nauseated]. This condition lasts as
long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after
it leaves. (Roll separately for each
[nauseated] character.) Any creature
that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue
to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.

*Stinking cloud*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell. A permanent
*stinking cloud*dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

Stone Shape

**Stone Shape**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

**Range** touch

**Target** stone or stone object touched, up to 10 cu. ft. + 1
cu. ft./level

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits
your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors,
and so forth with *stone shape,*fine detail isn't possible. There
is a 30% chance that any shape including moving parts simply
doesn't work.

Stoneskin

**Stoneskin**

**School** abjuration; **Level** druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (granite and diamond dust worth 250 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level or until discharged

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and
slashes. The subject gains
[DR] 10/adamantine. It
ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage
from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the
reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

Stone Tell

**Stone Tell**

**School** divination; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level

You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you
who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered
or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete
descriptions if asked. A stone's perspective, perception, and
knowledge may prevent the stone from providing the details you
are looking for. You can speak with natural or worked stone.

Stone to Flesh

**Stone to Flesh**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one [petrified] creature
or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to
10 ft. long

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates
(object); see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

This spell restores a [petrified]
creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The
creature must make a DC 15 [Fortitude]
save to survive the process. Any
[petrified] creature, regardless of
size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone
into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital
life force unless a life force or magical energy is available.
For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into
an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a
mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an
object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in
diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those
dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

Storm of Vengeance

**Storm of Vengeance**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric 9, druid 9

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** 360-ft.-radius storm cloud

**Duration** concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature
under the cloud must succeed on a
[Fortitude] save or be
[deafened] for 1d4 × 10 minutes. Each
round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional
effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.

*2nd Round*: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of
acid damage (no save).

*3rd Round*: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud.
You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed
at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity
damage. A creature struck can attempt a
[Reflex] save for half damage.

*4th Round*: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points
of bludgeoning damage (no save).

*5th through 10th Rounds*: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce
visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including
[darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A
creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
Speed is reduced by three-quarters.

Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible.
Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster
succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the
*storm of vengeance*'s save DC + the level of the spell the
caster is trying to cast.

Suggestion

**Suggestion**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until completed

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a
course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The
*suggestion*must be worded in such a manner as to make the
activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some
obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the
spell.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire
duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter
time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked
to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a
special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met
before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

A very reasonable *suggestion*causes the save to be made with a
penalty (such as –1 or –2).

**Suggestion, Mass**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[suggestion]*, except
that it can affect more creatures. The same
*[suggestion]*applies to all these creatures.

Summon Instrument

**Summon Instrument**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 0

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** one summoned handheld musical instrument

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell summons one handheld musical instrument of your
choice. This instrument appears in your hands or at your feet
(your choice). The instrument is typical for its type. Only one
instrument appears per casting, and it will play only for you.
You can't summon an instrument too large to be held in two hands.
The summoned instrument disappears at the end of this spell.

**School** conjuration (summoning) [see text]; **Level** bard 1,
cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a tiny bag and a small candle)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one summoned creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an
outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane).
It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your
turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If
you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to
attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other
actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st
Level list on Table 10–1. You choose which kind of creature to
summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the
spell.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another
creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel
abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that
cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot
use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with
expensive material components (such as
*[wish]*).

When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an
alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type.
Creatures on Table 10–1 marked with an “\*” are summoned with the
celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template,
if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which
template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “\*”
always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their
usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning
spell's type match your alignment.

**Summon Monster II**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 2, cleric 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

This spell functions like *[summon monster

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one summoned creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an
animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype,
or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and
acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the
best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature,
you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or
to perform other actions as you command.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another
creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel
abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that
cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot
use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that
have expensive material components (such as
*[wish]*).

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list
on Table 10–2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and
you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the
creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an
alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All
creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes
have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual
alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's
type match your alignment.

Summon Swarm

**Summon Swarm**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** bard 2, druid 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a square of red cloth)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one swarm of bats, rats, or spiders

**Duration** concentration + 2 rounds

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which
attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the
swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no
living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or
pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no
control over its target or direction of travel.

Sunbeam

**Sunbeam**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** line from your hand

**Duration** 1 round/level or until all beams are
[exhausted]

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] negates and
[Reflex] half; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to
evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call
forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th
level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your
allotment of beams is [exhausted].

Each creature in the beam is [blinded]
and takes 4d6 points of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight
is harmful or unnatural take double damage. A successful
[Reflex] save negates the blindness and
reduces the damage by half.

An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a
[Reflex] save is successful. In addition,
the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature
specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.

The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to
fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead
creatures.

Sunburst

**Sunburst**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** druid 8, sorcerer/wizard
8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (sunstone and fire source)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** 80-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] partial; see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**
yes

*Sunburst*causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently
from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are
[blinded] and take 6d6 points of
damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural
takes double damage. A successful
[Reflex] save negates the blindness and
reduces the damage by half.

An undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d6 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a
[Reflex] save is successful. In addition,
the burst results in the destruction of any undead creature
specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.

The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to
fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead
creatures.

*Sunburst*dispels any darkness spells of lower than 9th level
within its area.

Symbol of Death

**Symbol of Death**

**School** necromancy [death]; **Level** cleric 8,
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth 5,000 gp each)

**Range** 0 ft.; see text

**Effect** one symbol

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a
surface. When triggered, a *symbol of death*kills one or more
creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose
combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The *symbol
of death*affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures
with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the
*symbol*becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per
caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of
creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area
while the *symbol of death*is active is subject to its effect,
whether or not that creature was in the area when it was
triggered. A creature need save against the *symbol*only once as
long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area
and returns while the *symbol*is still active, it must save
again.

Until it is triggered, the *symbol of death*is inactive (though
visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a
*symbol of death*must always be placed in plain sight and in a
prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the
*symbol of death*ineffective, unless a creature removes the
covering, in which case the *symbol of death*works normally.

As a default, a *symbol of death*is triggered whenever a creature
does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the
rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or
passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the
trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet
from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or
more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).
Once the spell is cast, a *symbol of death*'s triggering
conditions cannot be changed.

In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it,
identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a
*symbol of death*to render it inoperative triggers it if the
symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a *symbol of
death*offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered *symbol of
death* remains untriggered if an item bearing the *symbol of
death*is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a *symbol of
death*cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the
weapon strikes a foe.

You can also set special triggering limitations of your own.
These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special
conditions for triggering a *symbol of death*can be based on a
creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be
based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as
level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

When scribing a *symbol of death*, you can specify a password or
phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the
symbol's effect*.*Anyone using the password remains immune to
that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains
within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and
returns later, it must use the password again.

You also can attune any number of creatures to the *symbol of
death,*but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one
or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small
group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1
hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24
hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25
creatures. Any creature attuned to a *symbol of death*cannot
trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its
radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered
attuned to your own *symbols of death*, and thus always ignore
the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.

*[Read magic]*allows you to identify
a *symbol*with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the *symbol's*spell
level). Of course, if the *symbol*is set to be triggered by
reading it, this will trigger the symbol.

A *symbol of death*can be removed by a successful *[dispel
magic]*targeted solely on the
rune. An *erase*spell has no effect on a *symbol of
death.*Destruction of the surface where a *symbol of death*is
inscribed destroys the *symbol*but also triggers it.

*Symbol of death*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell. A permanent
*symbol of death*that is disabled or has affected its maximum
number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then
can be triggered again as normal.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of death*are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find
a *symbol of death*and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in
each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for *symbol of death*.

Symbol of Fear

**Symbol of Fear**

**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates

This spell functions like *[symbol of
death]*, except that all
creatures within 60 feet of the *symbol of fear*instead become
[panicked] for 1 round per caster
level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of fear*are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find
a *symbol of fear*and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each
case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for *symbol of fear*.

Symbol of Insanity

**Symbol of Insanity**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates

This spell functions like *[symbol of
death]*, except that all
creatures within the radius of the *symbol of insanity*instead
become permanently insane (as the
*[insanity]*spell).

*symbol of insanity*simply remains active for 10 minutes per
caster level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of insanity*are hard to
detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill
to find a *symbol of insanity*and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for *symbol of
insanity*.

Symbol of Pain

**Symbol of Pain**

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard
5

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

This spell functions like *[symbol of
death]*, except that each
creature within the radius of a *symbol of pain*instead suffers
wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill
checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after
the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike *[symbol of death]*,
*symbol of pain*has no hit point limit; once triggered, a *symbol
of pain*simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of pain*are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find
a *symbol of pain*and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each

6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates

This spell functions like *[symbol of
death]*, except that all
creatures within the radius of a *symbol of persuasion*instead
become charmed by the caster (as the *[charm
monster]*spell) for 1 hour per
caster level.

Unlike *[symbol of death]*,
*symbol of persuasion*has no hit point limit; once triggered, a
*symbol of persuasion*simply remains active for 10 minutes per
caster level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of persuasion*are hard to
detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill
to find a *symbol of persuasion*and Disable Device to thwart it.
The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for *symbol of
persuasion*.

Symbol of Sleep

**Symbol of Sleep**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered
diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates

This spell functions like *[symbol of
death]*, except that all
creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the *symbol of
sleep*instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes.
Unlike with the *[sleep]*spell, sleeping
creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time
expires.

Unlike *[symbol of death]*,
*symbol of sleep*has no hit point limit; once triggered, a
*symbol of sleep*simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster
level.

*Note*: Magic traps such as *symbol of sleep*are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find
a *symbol of sleep*and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in

creature within 60 feet of a *symbol of weakness*instead suffers
crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of
[Strength] damage.

Unlike *[symbol of death]*,
*symbol of weakness*has no hit point limit; once triggered, a
*symbol of weakness*simply remains active for 10 minutes per
caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol
once.

Sympathetic Vibration

**Sympathetic Vibration**

**School** evocation [sonic]; **Level** bard 6

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, F (a tuning fork)

**Range** touch

**Target** one freestanding structure

**Duration** up to 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create
a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration
deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure,
bypassing hardness. You can choose at the time of casting to
limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round
per level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not
freestanding, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no
damage occurs.

*Sympathetic vibration*cannot affect creatures (including
constructs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets
no saving throw to resist the effect.

Sympathy

**Sympathy**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of honey and crushed pearls worth
1,500 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations
that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or
creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The
particular kind of creature to be affected must be named
specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough.
Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.

Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and
pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the
object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is
overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released
from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 × 10
minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts
to return to the area or object.

*Sympathy*counters and dispels
*[antipathy]*.
