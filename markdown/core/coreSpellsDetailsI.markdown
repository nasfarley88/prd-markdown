**Ice Storm**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (dust and water)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell,
dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold
damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs
once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the
spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures
inside this area take a –4 penalty on Perception skill checks and
the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of
the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no
aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

Identify

**Identify**

**School**divination; **Level**bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)

**Range**60 ft.

**Area**cone-shaped emanation

**Duration**3 rounds/level (D)

**Saving Throw**: none; **[Spell
Resistance]**: no

This spell functions as *[detect
magic]*, except that it gives you
a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the
properties and command words of magic items in your possession.
This spell does not allow you to identify artifacts.

Illusory Script

**Illusory Script**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard
3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 minute per page

**Components** V, S, M (lead-based ink worth 50 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.

**Duration** one day/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper,
or any suitable writing material. The *illusory script*appears to
be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or
people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the
writing; it's unintelligible to any other character*.*

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers
a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A
successful saving throw means the creature can look away with
only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature
is subject to a *[suggestion]*
implanted in the script by you at the time the *illusory script*
spell was cast. The *[suggestion]*
lasts only 30 minutes. Typical *suggestions* include “Close the
book and leave,” “Forget the existence of this note,” and so
forth. If successfully dispelled by *[dispel
magic],*the *illusory script*and
its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a
combination of the *[true
seeing]*spell with the *[read
magic]*or *[comprehend
languages]*spell.

Illusory Wall

**Illusory Wall**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** image 1 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief (if
interacted with); **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or
similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but
physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the
spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection
abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a
probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though
such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although
the caster can see through his *illusory wall*, other creatures
cannot, even if they succeed at their will save (but they do
learn that it is not real).

Imbue with Spell Ability

**Imbue with Spell Ability**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched; see text

**Duration** permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the
ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with
an [Intelligence] score of
at least 5 and a [Wisdom] score
of at least 9 can receive this boon. Only cleric spells from the
schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can
be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject
can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of
*imbue with spell ability*can't exceed this limit.

  HD of Recipient   Spells Imbued
  ----------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  2 or lower        One 1st-level spell
  3–4               One or two 1st-level spells
  5 or higher       One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell

The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range,
duration, area, and the like) function according to your level,
not the level of the recipient.

Once you cast *imbue with spell ability,*you cannot prepare a new
4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued
spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the *imbue with spell
ability*spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your
deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put.
If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and
that number drops below your current number of active *imbue with
spell ability*spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are
dispelled.

To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able
to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must be
able to move freely. To cast a spell with a material component or
focus, it must have the materials or focus.

Implosion

**Implosion**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one corporeal creature/round

**Duration** concentration (up to 1 round per 2 levels)

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal
creature's body. Each round you concentrate (including the
first), you can cause one creature to collapse in on itself,
inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If you break
concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions
that have already happened remain in effect. You can target a
particular creature only once with each casting of the spell.
Implosion has no effect on creatures in [gaseous
form] or on
[incorporeal] creatures.

Imprisonment

**Imprisonment**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

When you cast *imprisonment*and touch a creature, it is entombed
in a state of suspended animation (see the *[temporal
stasis]*spell) in a small
sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains
there unless a *freedom*spell is cast at the locale where the
imprisonment took place. Magical search by a *crystal ball,*a
*[locate object]*spell, or some
other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature
is imprisoned, but *[discern
location]*does. A
*[wish]*or
*[miracle]*spell will not free the
recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the
target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a
–4 penalty on its save.

Incendiary Cloud

**Incendiary Cloud**

**School** conjuration (creation) [fire]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area**cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**: [Reflex] half, see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**:
no

An *incendiary cloud*spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot
through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a
*[fog cloud]*does. In addition, the white-hot
embers within the cloud deal 6d6 points of fire damage to
everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets
can make [Reflex] saves each round to
take half damage.

As with a *[cloudkill]*spell, the
smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the
smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin,
which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast
the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud move as much
as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend
beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the
remainder's spread thereafter.

As with *[fog cloud]*, wind disperses the smoke,
and the spell can't be cast underwater.

Inflict Critical Wounds

**Inflict Critical Wounds**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 4

This spell functions like *[inflict light
wounds]*, except
that you deal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +20).

**Inflict Critical Wounds, Mass**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 8

This spell functions like *mass [inflict light
wounds]*, except
that it deals 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +40).

Inflict Light Wounds

**Inflict Light Wounds**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] half; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative
energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures
such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming
it.

**Inflict Light Wounds, Mass**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] half; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of
origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +25) to nearby living enemies.

Like other *inflict*spells, *mass [inflict light
wounds]*cures undead in its area rather
than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting
*inflict*spells can also spontaneously cast *mass inflict*spells.

Inflict Moderate Wounds

**Inflict Moderate Wounds**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 2

This spell functions like *[inflict light
wounds]*, except
that you deal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +10).

**Inflict Moderate Wounds, Mass**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 6

This spell functions like *mass inflict light wounds*, except
that it deals 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +30).

Inflict Serious Wounds

**Inflict Serious Wounds**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 3

This spell functions like *[inflict light
wounds]*, except
that you deal 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +15).

**Inflict Serious Wounds, Mass**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 7

This spell functions like *mass inflict light wounds*, except
that it deals 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +35).

Insanity

**Insanity**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

The affected creature suffers from a continuous
*confusion*effect, as the spell.

*[Remove curse]* does not
remove*insanity. Greater restoration, [heal],
[limited wish],
[miracle],* or *[wish]*
can restore the creature.

Insect Plague

**Insect Plague**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** cleric 5, druid 5

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** one swarm of wasps per three levels, each of which
must be adjacent to at least one other swarm

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to
a maximum of six swarms at 18th level). The swarms must be
summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm
(that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You may
summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other
creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area.
The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue
creatures that flee.

Instant Summons

**Instant Summons**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (sapphire worth 1,000 gp)

**Range** see text

**Target** one object weighing 10 lbs. or less whose longest
dimension is 6 ft. or less

**Duration** permanent until discharged

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You call some nonliving item directly to your hand from virtually
any location.

First, you must place your *[arcane
mark]* on the item. Then you cast
this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of
the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you
can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when
the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears
instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell
does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly
where that creature is located when the summons occurs.

The inscription on the gem is
[invisible]. It is also unreadable,
except by means of a *[read
magic]*spell, to anyone but you.

The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other
creature has claimed ownership of it.

Interposing Hand

**Interposing Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a soft glove)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 10-ft. hand

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

*Interposing hand*creates a Large magic hand that appears between
you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves
to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or
how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4
[AC]) for you against that opponent.
Nothing can fool the hand—it sticks with the selected opponent in
spite of
*[darkness],*[invisibility]*,*
polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The
hand does not pursue an opponent, however.

An *interposing hand*is 10 feet long and about that wide with its
fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when
you're undamaged, and is [AC] 20 (–1
size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but
most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.

The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It
cannot push through a *[wall of
force]*or enter an *[antimagic
field]*, but it suffers the
full effect of a *[prismatic
wall]*or *[prismatic
sphere].*The hand makes
saving throws as its caster.

*[Disintegrate]*or a successful
*[dispel magic]*destroys it.

Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push
past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot
reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds,
but it still affects the creature's attacks.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

Invisibility

**Invisibility**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)

**Range** personal or touch

**Target** you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100
lbs./level

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless)
or [Will] negates (harmless, object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless) or yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched becomes
[invisible]. If the recipient is a
creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell
on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject,
unless you can normally see
[invisible] things or you employ
magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an
[invisible] creature become visible;
items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches
worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes
[invisible], although a source of
light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no
visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but
that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically silenced*,*and certain
other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as
swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is
required, a stationary [invisible]
creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is
reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the
subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an
attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect
includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the
[invisible] character's perceptions.
Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell.
Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an
[invisible] being can open doors,
talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack,
cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the
bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release
attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly,
however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear.
Spells such as *[bless]*that specifically
affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even
when they include foes in their area.

*Invisibility*can be made permanent (on objects only) with a
*[permanency]*spell.

**Invisibility, Greater**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Components**: V, S

**Target** you or creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless)

This spell functions like *[invisibility]*, except
that it doesn't end if the subject attacks.

**Invisibility, Mass**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Targets** any number of creatures, no two of which can be more
than 180 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[invisibility],*except
that the effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in
the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each
other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than
180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two
individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one
loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other,
they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds
180 feet.

Invisibility Purge

**Invisibility Purge**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5
feet per caster level that negates all forms of
[invisibility].

Anything [invisible] becomes visible
while in the area.

Invisibility Sphere

**Invisibility Sphere**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Components**: V, S, M

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature

This spell functions like
*[invisibility],*except that
this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet
of the recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the
effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as
if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of
the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area
after the spell is cast do not become
[invisible]. Affected creatures
(other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility
only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the
*invisibility sphere*ends.

Iron Body

**Iron Body**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a piece of iron from an iron golem, a
hero's armor, or a war machine)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants
you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain [damage
reduction] 15/adamantine. You
are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage,
deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and
all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration,
because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is
in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire. However,
you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect
iron golems.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your
[Strength] score, but you take
a –6 penalty to [Dexterity] as
well 
score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have
an arcane spell failure chance of 35% and a –6 armor check
penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot
drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.

Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you
(1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you
are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

Your weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in
water like a stone. However, you could survive the lack of air at
the bottom of the ocean—at least until the spell duration
expires.

Ironwood

**Ironwood**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 1 minute/lb. created

**Components** V, S, F (wood to be transformed)

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** an *ironwood*object weighing up to 5 lbs./level

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Ironwood*is a magical substance created by druids from normal
wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way,
*ironwood*is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel.
Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on *ironwood*.
Spells that affect wood do affect *ironwood*, although
*ironwood*does not burn. Using this spell with *[wood
shape]*or a wood-related Craft check,
you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus,
wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as
durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are
freely usable by druids.

Further, if you make only half as much *ironwood*as the spell
would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so
created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

Irresistible Dance

**Irresistible Dance**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 1d4+1 rounds

**Saving Throw** [Will] partial; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing
so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect
makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than
caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a –4 penalty to
[Armor Class] and a –10 penalty on
[Reflex] saves, and it negates any
[AC] bonus granted by a shield the
target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity
each round on its turn. A successful [Will]
save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.
