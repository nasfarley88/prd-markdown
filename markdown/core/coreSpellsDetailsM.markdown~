**Mage Armor**

**School** conjuration (creation) [force]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a piece of cured leather)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of
a *mage armor*spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class).

Unlike mundane armor, *mage armor*entails no armor check penalty,
arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since *mage
armor*is made of force,
[incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) creatures can't
bypass it the way they do normal armor.

Mage Hand

**Mage Hand**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5
lbs.

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at
will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object
as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the
distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell's
range.

Mage's Disjunction

**Mage's Disjunction**

**School**abjuration; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area**all magical effects and magic items within a
40-ft.-radius burst, or one magic item (see text)

**Duration**1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the
spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined.
That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and
destroyed completely (ending the effect as a *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell does), and each
permanent magic item must make a successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save or be turned into a normal item
for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature's
possession uses its own [Will](../combat.html#_will) save bonus
or its possessor's [Will](../combat.html#_will) save bonus,
whichever is higher. If an item's saving throw results in a
natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being
suppressed.

You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an
*[antimagic field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field).*If the
*[antimagic field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field)*survives
the *disjunction,*no items within it are disjoined.

You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item
gets a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save at a â€“5 penalty to avoid
being permanently destroyed. Even artifacts are subject to
*mage's disjunction,*though there is only a 1% chance per caster
level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful,
the artifact's power unravels, and it is destroyed (with no
save). If an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save or permanently lose all
spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by
mortal magic, not even *[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*or
*[wish](wish.html#_wish)*. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous
business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some
powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the
device.

Mage's Faithful Hound

**Mage's Faithful Hound**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone,
and a thread)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** phantom watchdog

**Duration** 1 hour/caster level or until discharged, then 1
round/caster level; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) to everyone but
yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does
not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any
Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those
within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in
the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the
barking.) The hound sees [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible)
and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it
does react to shadow illusions.

If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog
stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus,
2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also
gets the bonuses appropriate to an
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) creature (see
*[invisibility](invisibility.html#_invisibility)*).

The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its
first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of
a magic weapon for the purpose of [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). The hound cannot
be attacked, but it can be dispelled.

The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound
begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you
are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell
ends.

Mage's Lucubration

**Mage's Lucubration**

**School** transmutation; **Level**wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

You instantly prepare any one spell of 5th level or lower that
you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been
actually cast during that period. The chosen spell is stored in
your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion.

If the recalled spell requires material components, you must
provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the
material components are available.

Mage's Magnificent Mansion

**Mage's Magnificent Mansion**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a miniature ivory door, a piece of
polished marble, and a silver spoon, each worth 5 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft.
cubes/level (S)

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single
entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry
point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet
wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the
mansion, and the portal is shut and made
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) behind you when you
enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once
observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a
magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere
is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the
spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient
foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per
caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as
two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who
enter. The servants function as *unseen servant*spells except
that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal,
outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions
inside it pass to the plane beyond.

Mage's Private Sanctum

**Mage's Private Sanctum**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a sheet of lead, a piece of glass, a wad
of cotton, and powdered chrysolite)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 30-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** 24 hours (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from
outside sees only a dark, foggy mass.
[Darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) cannot penetrate it.
No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can
eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the
area, and those within are immune to *[detect
thoughts](detectThoughts.html#_detect-thoughts)*. The ward
prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because
it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication,
such as a *[sending](sending.html#_sending)*or *message*spell, or
telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her
familiar.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into
and out of the area.

*Mage's private sanctum*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Mage's Sword

**Mage's Sword**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a miniature platinum sword worth 250 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one sword

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of
force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you
desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword
attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its
attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence
bonus or your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional
+3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal
and [incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) creatures. It
deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19â€“20
and a critical multiplier of Ã—2.

The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a
bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes
beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you
are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to
switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword
continues to attack the previous round's target.

The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but
*[dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*,
*[disintegrate](disintegrate.html#_disintegrate)*, a *[sphere of
annihilation](../magicItems/artifacts.html#_sphere-of-annihilation)*,
or a *[rod of
cancellation](../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation)*affects
it. The sword's [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) is 13 (10, +0
size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).

If an attacked creature has [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance), the resistance
is checked the first time *mage's sword*strikes it. If the sword
is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the
sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the
duration of the spell.

Magic Aura

**Magic Aura**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a small square of silk that must be
passed over the object that receives the aura)

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object weighing up to 5 lbs./level

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You alter an item's aura so that it registers to *detect*spells
(and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were
nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject
of a spell you specify. If the object bearing *magic aura*has
*identify*cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner
recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual
qualities if he succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save.
Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals
what the true magic is.

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it
is an artifact, for instance), *magic aura*doesn't work.

*Note*: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a
masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks
suspicious if it has a magical aura.

Magic Circle against Chaos

**Magic Circle against Chaos**

**School** abjuration [lawful]; **Level** cleric 3, paladin 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

This spell functions like *[magic circle against
evil](magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil),*except
that it is similar to *[protection from
chaos](protectionFromChaos.html#_protection-from-chaos)*instead
of *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*, and it can
imprison a nonlawful called creature.

Magic Circle against Evil

**Magic Circle against Evil**

**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** cleric 3, paladin 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered
silver)

**Range** touch

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no;
see text

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a *[protection
from evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*spell,
and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either.
Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only
one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If
successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in
the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not
protected. You must overcome a creature's [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) in order to keep
it at bay (as in the third function of *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*), but the
deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental
control apply regardless of enemies' [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance).

This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when
casting it. A *magic circle against evil*can be focused inward
rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a
nongood called creature (such as those called by the *[lesser
planar binding](planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-lesser),
[planar binding](planarBinding.html#_planar-binding),*and
*[greater planar
binding](planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-greater)*spells) for
a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast
the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the
*magic circle*. The creature cannot cross the circle's
boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area
is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal
*[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*spell for
that creature only.

A *magic circle*leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the
circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of
spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped
creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or
indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has
[spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance), it can
test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance), the creature
breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any
form of dimensional travel (*[astral
projection](astralProjection.html#_astral-projection), blink,
[dimension door](dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door),
[etherealness](etherealness.html#_etherealness),
[gate](gate.html#_gate), [plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift), [shadow
walk](shadowWalk.html#_shadow-walk),
[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport),*and similar abilities) can
simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the
creature's extradimensional escape by casting a *[dimensional
anchor](dimensionalAnchor.html#_dimensional-anchor)*spell on it,
but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are
successful, the *anchor*effect lasts as long as the *magic
circle*does. The creature cannot reach across the *magic
circle,*but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical
abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target
it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle
itself.

You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure
with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various
magical sigils) to make the *magic circle*more secure. Drawing
the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20
Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If
the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when
drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure
to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If
time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes
to the task, you can take 20.

A successful diagram allows you to cast a *[dimensional
anchor](dimensionalAnchor.html#_dimensional-anchor)*spell on the
*magic circle*during the round before casting any summoning
spell. The *anchor*holds any called creatures in the *magic
circle*for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its
[spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) against a
*magic circle*prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities
or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) check to break
free of the trap (see the *[lesser planar
binding](planarBinding.html#_planar-binding-lesser)*spell), the
DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if
anything disturbs the diagramâ€”even a straw laid across it. The
creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or
indirectly, as noted above.

This spell is not cumulative with *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*and vice
versa.

Magic Circle against Good

**Magic Circle against Good**

**School** abjuration [evil]; **Level** cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard
3

This spell functions like *[magic circle against
evil](magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil),*except
that it is similar to *[protection from
good](protectionFromGood.html#_protection-from-good)*instead of
*[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*, and it can
imprison a nonevil called creature.

Magic Circle against Law

**Magic Circle against Law**

**School** abjuration [chaotic]; **Level** cleric 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

This spell functions like *[magic circle against
evil](magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil),*except
that it is similar to *[protection from
law](protectionFromLaw.html#_protection-from-law)*instead of
*[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*, and it can
imprison a nonchaotic called creature.

Magic Fang

**Magic Fang**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

*Magic fang*gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the
subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The
spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural
weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from
nonlethal damage to lethal damage.

*Magic fang*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

**Magic Fang, Greater**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, ranger 3

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like *[magic fang](#magic-fang)*, except
that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per
four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a
natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) aside from magic.

Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural
weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster
level).

*Greater magic fang*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Magic Jar

**Magic Jar**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until you return to your body

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

By casting *magic jar,*you place your soul in a gem or large
crystal (known as the *magic jar*), leaving your body lifeless.
Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing
its soul into the *magic jar.*You may move back to the jar
(thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to
possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back
to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the
spell, the *magic jar*must be within spell range and you must
know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of
effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body
is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.

While in the *magic jar,*you can sense and attack any life force
within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of
existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the
creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or
positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can
sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and
another and can determine whether a life force is powered by
positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by
negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are,
souls.)

You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker
creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you
attempt to possess is determined randomly.

Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is
blocked by *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*or a similar
ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the
*magic jar*unless the subject succeeds on a
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save. Failure to take over the host
leaves your life force in the *magic jar,*and the target
automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to
possess its body again.

If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body,
and the host's life force is imprisoned in the *magic jar.*You
keep your [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence),
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom),
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new), level, class,
base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental
abilities. The body retains its
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength),
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity),
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), hit points,
natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra
limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more
advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to
activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The
creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the
body.

As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the
*magic jar*if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its
body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own
body.

If the host body is slain, you return to the *magic jar,*if
within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is
dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell,
both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is
treated as slain.

If the spell ends while you are in the *magic jar,*you return to
your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If
the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body
(or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the
soul in the *magic jar*returns to its body (or dies if it is out
of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the
spell can be dispelled at either the *magic jar*or the host's
location.

Magic Missile

**Magic Missile**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** up to five creatures, no two of which can be more
than 15 ft. apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and
strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee
combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total
concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out.
Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional
missileâ€”two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the
maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot
multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or
several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature.
You must designate targets before you check for [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) or roll damage.

Magic Mouth

**Magic Mouth**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust
worth 10 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature or object

**Duration** permanent until discharged

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted
mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time
a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer
words long, can be in any language known by you and can be
delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter
verbal components, use command words, or activate magical
effects. It does, however, move according to the words
articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the
statue would move and appear to speak. *Magic mouth*can also be
placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled
according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as
general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and
audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to
be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal
darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical
*[darkness](darkness.html#_darkness)*or
*[invisibility](invisibility.html#_invisibility)*does. Silent
movement or magical *[silence](silence.html#_silence)*defeats
audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types
of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can
serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A *magic
mouth*cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class
except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a
6th-level caster can command a *magic mouth*to respond to
triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth
can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in
line of sight or within hearing distance.

*Magic mouth*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Magic Stone

**Magic Stone**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 1, druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** up to three pebbles touched

**Duration** 30 minutes or until discharged

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger
than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when
thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20
feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50
feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and
damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged
attack*.*Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage
(including the spell's enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points
against undead.

Magic Vestment

**Magic Vestment**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** armor or shield touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus
of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) bonus for the purpose of this
spell.

Magic Weapon

**Magic Weapon**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target**weapon touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

*Magic weapon*gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and
damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a
masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed
strike (instead, see *[magic fang](magicFang.html#_magic-fang)*).
A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can
be enhanced by this spell.

**Magic Weapon, Greater**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 4, paladin 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be
together at the time of casting)

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

This spell functions like *[magic weapon](#magic-weapon),*except
that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage
rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does
not allow a weapon to bypass [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) aside from magic.

Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or
bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have
to be together (in the same quiver or other container).
Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation
after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than
as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Major Creation

**Major Creation**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Duration** see text

This spell functions like *[minor
creation](minorCreation.html#_minor-creation),*except that you
can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal,
metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with
its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following
table.

Hardness and Rarity Examples

Duration

Vegetable matter

2 hr./level

Stone, crystal, base metals

1 hr./level

Precious metals

20 min./level

Gems

10 min./level

Rare metal\*

1 round/level

\* Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral. You can't
use major creation to create a cold iron item.

Major Image

**Major Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard
3

**Duration** Concentration + 3 rounds

This spell functions like *[silent
image](silentImage.html#_silent-image),*except that sound, smell,
and thermal illusions are included in the spell effect. While
concentrating, you can move the image within the range.

The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause
the illusion to react appropriately.

Make Whole

**Make Whole**

**School**transmutation; **Level**cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one object of up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct
creature of any size

This spell functions as *mending*, except that it repairs 1d6
points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature
(maximum 5d6).

*Make whole* can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or
less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your
caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with
charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and
scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When *make whole* is
used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to
magic as if the spell did not allow [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance).

Mark of Justice

**Mark of Justice**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 5, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** permanent; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You mark a subject and state some behavior on the part of the
subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark
curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of
undesirable behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick
any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the
effect of *[bestow curse](bestowCurse.html#_bestow-curse)*.

Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on
the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or
restrained.

Like the effect of *[bestow
curse](bestowCurse.html#_bestow-curse)*, a *mark of
justice*cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a *[break
enchantment](breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment)*,
*[limited wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish)*,
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*, *[remove
curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*, or
*[wish](wish.html#_wish)*spell. *[Remove
curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*works only if its caster
level is equal to or higher than your *mark of justice*caster
level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark
has activated.

Mass (Spell Name)

**Mass (Spell Name)**

Any spell whose name begins with *mass*is alphabetized according

Maze

**Maze**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard
8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each
round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) check to
escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject
doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the
subject.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it
had been when the *maze*spell was cast. If this location is
filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest
open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a
plane, such as *[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport)*and
*[dimension door](dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door),*do not
help a creature escape a *maze*spell, although a *[plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift)*spell allows it to exit to
whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not
affected by this spell.

Meld into Stone

**Meld into Stone**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level

*Meld into stone*enables you to meld your body and possessions
into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to
accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting
is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear
merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell
fails and is wasted.

While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with
the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware
of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while
hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can
be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor
physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial
destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's
complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless
you make a DC 18 [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save.
Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.

Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the
stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's
duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you
voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take
5d6 points of damage.

The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are
occupying. *[Stone to
flesh](stoneToFlesh.html#_stone-to-flesh)*expels you and deals
you 5d6 points of damage. S*[tone
shape](stoneShape.html#_stone-shape)*deals 3d6 points of damage
but does not expel you. *[Transmute rock to
mud](transmuteRockToMud.html#_transmute-rock-to-mud)*expels you
and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save, in which case you
are merely expelled. Finally,
*[passwall](passwall.html#_passwall)*expels you without damage.

Mending

**Mending**

**School**transmutation; **Level**bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time**10 minutes

**Components**V, S

**Range**10 ft.

**Target** one object of up to 1 lb./level

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**: yes (harmless,
object)

This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to
the object. If the object has the
[broken](../glossary.html#_broken) condition, this condition is
removed if the object is restored to at least half its original
hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for
this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this
spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than
that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit
points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but this spell
does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not
affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect
on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it
can still repair damage done to such items.

Message

**Message**

**School** transmutation [language-dependent]; **Level** bard 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a piece of copper wire)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one creature/level

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those
nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You
point your finger at each creature you want to receive the
message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to
all targeted creatures within range. Magical
*[silence](silence.html#_silence),*1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt
blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a
straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open
path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length
lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the
message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits
sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To
speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.

Meteor Swarm

**Meteor Swarm**

**School**evocation [fire]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area**four 40-ft.-radius spreads, see text

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none or [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half,
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Meteor swarm*is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is
similar to *[fireball](fireball.html#_fireball)*in many aspects.
When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your
outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you
select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.

If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged
touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature
struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no
save) and takes a â€“4 penalty on the saving throw against the
sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its
target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's
space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.

Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a
40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each
creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more
than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite
stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added
together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is
applied only once.

Mind Blank

**Mind Blank**

**School**abjuration; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**24 hours

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather
information about the target through divination magic (such as
*[detect evil](detectEvil.html#_detect-evil), [locate
creature](locateCreature.html#_locate-creature), scry,*and*see
invisible*). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on
saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects.
*Mind blank*even foils *[limited
wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish)*,
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*, and
*[wish](wish.html#_wish)*spells when they are used in such a way
as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying
that scans an area the creature is in, such as *[arcane
eye](arcaneEye.html#_arcane-eye),*the spell works but the
creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are
targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

Mind Fog

**Mind Fog**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 30 minutes and 2d6 rounds; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Mind fog*produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental
resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the *mind fog*take
a â€“10 penalty on [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) checks
and [Will](../combat.html#_will) saves. (A creature that
successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not
make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected
creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and
for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30
minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong
wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

Minor Creation

**Minor Creation**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same sort
of item you plan to create with *minor creation)*

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving plant
matter, up to 1 cu. ft./level

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving vegetable
matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot
per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate Craft skill
check to make a complex item.

Attempting to use any created object as a material component
causes the spell to fail.

Minor Image

**Minor Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard
2

**Duration** concentration + 2 rounds

This spell functions like *[silent
image](silentImage.html#_silent-image)*, except that *minor
image*includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.

Miracle

**Miracle**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S; see text

**Range** see text

**Target, Effect, or Area**see text

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You don't so much cast a *miracle*as request one. You state what
you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the
power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A *miracle*can do any of the following things.

-   Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
-   Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
-   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as
    *[feeblemind](feeblemind.html#_feeblemind)*or
    *[insanity](insanity.html#_insanity)*.
-   Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above
    effects.

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting
such a *miracle*costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond
because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of
especially powerful *miracles*of this sort could include the
following:

-   Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen
    allies to continue fighting.
-   Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear,
    from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers
    with no chance of error.
-   Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption,
    flood, or other major natural disaster.

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or
alignment's) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) as normal, but
the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a *miracle*spell
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
100 gp, you must provide that component.

Mirage Arcana

**Mirage Arcana**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Area** one 20-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** concentration +1 hour/ level (D)

This spell functions like *[hallucinatory
terrain](hallucinatoryTerrain.html#_hallucinatory-terrain)*,
except that it enables you to make any area appear to be
something other than it is. The illusion includes audible,
visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike *[hallucinatory
terrain](hallucinatoryTerrain.html#_hallucinatory-terrain),*the
spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where
none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add
creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves
within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a
real location).

Mirror Image

**Mirror Image**

**School**illusion (figment); **Level**bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 min./level

This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that
inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies
to precisely locate and attack you.

When *mirror image*is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three
caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These
images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your
movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked
or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there
is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images
instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the
selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the
figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of
your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect
you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and
effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally
and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a
touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a
figment.

An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you
are [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) or the attacker is
blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances
still apply).

Misdirection

**Misdirection**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from
divination spells that reveal auras (*[detect
evil](detectEvil.html#_detect-evil), [detect
magic](detectMagic.html#_detect-magic), [discern
lies](discernLies.html#_discern-lies),*and the like). On casting
the spell, you choose another object within range. For the
duration of the spell, the subject of *misdirection*is detected
as if it were the other object. Neither the subject nor the other
object gets a saving throw against this effect. Detection spells
provide information based on the second object rather than on the
actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection
succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save. For instance,
you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range
at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in
alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types
of divination magic (*[augury](augury.html#_augury), [detect
thoughts](detectThoughts.html#_detect-thoughts),
[clairaudience/clairvoyance](clairaudienceClairvoyance.html#_clairaudience-clairvoyance),*and
the like).

Mislead

**Mislead**

**School** illusion (figment, glamer); **Level** bard 5,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target/Effect** you/one illusory double

**Duration** 1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see
text

**Saving Throw** none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief
(if interacted with); see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You become [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) (as *greater
invisibility*, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory
double of you (as *[major image](majorImage.html#_major-image),*a
figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your
double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter
moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on
the first round after the casting). You can make the figment
appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that
observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible). You and the figment can
then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed
and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack
or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it,
plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the
illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until
the duration expires. The *greater invisibility*lasts for 1 round
per level, regardless of concentration.

Mnemonic Enhancer

**Mnemonic Enhancer**

**School** transmutation; **Level**wizard 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of string, and ink consisting of
squid secretion mixed with black dragon's blood), F (an ivory
plaque worth 50 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or
retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when
the spell is cast.

*Prepare*: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A
cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and
cast these spells normally.

*Retain*: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had
cast up to 1 round before you started casting the *mnemonic
enhancer*. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.

In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade
after 24 hours (if not cast).

Modify Memory

**Modify Memory**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 round; see text

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes
of its memories in one of the following ways.

-   Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually
    experienced. This spell cannot negate *charm,
    [geas/quest](geasQuest.html#_geas-quest),
    [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion),*or similar spells.
-   Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it
    actually experienced.
-   Change the details of an event the subject actually
    experienced.
-   Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save,
you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a
period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify)
visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your
concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete,
or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this
time, the spell is lost.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's
actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural
inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the
creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar
excuse.

Moment of Prescience

**Moment of Prescience**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until discharged

This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's
duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you
an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any
single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or
skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the
insight bonus to your [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against a
single attack (even if
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed)). Activating the
effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on
another character's turn. You must choose to use the *moment of
prescience*before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used,
the spell ends. You can't have more than one *moment of
prescience*active on you at the same time.

Mount

**Mount**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (a bit of horse hair)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one mount

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as
a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes
with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.

Move Earth

**Move Earth**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** see text

**Components** V, S, M (clay, loam, sand, and an iron blade)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft.
deep (S)

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

*Move earth*moves dirt (clay, loam, sand, and soil), possibly
collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so
forth.

In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area
to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot
square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The
maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes
to move.

This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground.
Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth
reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is
achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly
unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative
topography.

The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow
to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or
filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

This spell has no effect on earth creatures.
