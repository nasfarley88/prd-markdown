**Telekinesis**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target or Targets** see text

**Duration** concentration (up to 1 round/level) or
instantaneous; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object) or
none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (object);
see text

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending
on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle,
sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert
a single short, violent thrust.

*Sustained Force*: A sustained force moves an object weighing no
more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th
level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect
on an object it possesses with a successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save or with [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance).

This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but
it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved
vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot
be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is
forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any
reason, the object falls or stops.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand.
For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned,
an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the
weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots,
though delicate activities such as these require DC 15
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) checks.

*Combat Maneuver*: Alternatively, once per round, you can use
*[telekinesis](#telekinesis)*to perform a bull rush, disarm,
grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as
normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity,
you use your caster level in place of your [Combat Maneuver
Bonus](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus), and you add your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier (if
a wizard) or [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) or
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) modifier. No save
is allowed against these attempts, but [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applies normally.
This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but
it ends if you cease concentration.

*Violent Thrust*: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in
a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster
level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet
of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all
the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per
caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).

You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object
thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack
bonus + your [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
modifier (if a wizard) or
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier (if a
sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) bonus; note that
arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in
this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per
25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage
per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures
that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be
hurled, but they are allowed [Will](../combat.html#_will) saves
(and [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)) to
negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are
targeted by the spell.

If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it
takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

Telekinetic Sphere

**Telekinetic Sphere**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a crystal sphere and a pair of small
magnets)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures
or objects

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) negates
(object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (object)

This spell functions like *[resilient
sphere](resilientSphere.html#_resilient-sphere),*but the
creatures or objects caught inside the globe created by the spell
are made nearly weightless. Anything contained within a
*telekinetic sphere*weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal
weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that
normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control
extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per
caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its
contents.

You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it
contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by
concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the
round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a
standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a
round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in
that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling
rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface. You can resume
concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the
spell's duration.

The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is
not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.

You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

Telepathic Bond

**Telepathic Bond**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (two eggshells from two different
creatures)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** you plus one willing creature per three levels, no
two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of
willing creatures, each of which must have an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score of 3
or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all
the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through
the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is
established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it
works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond
forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

*Telepathic bond*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell, though it only
bonds two creatures per casting of
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*.

Teleportation Circle

**Teleportation Circle**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard
9

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, M (amber dust to cover circle worth 1,000 gp)

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate
it

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that
teleports, as *[greater
teleport](teleport.html#_teleport-greater),*any creature who
stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the
destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails
if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a
solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have
no clear description, or to another plane.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If
you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you
need to mark the circle in some way.

*Teleportation circle*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell. A permanent
*teleportation circle*that is disabled becomes inactive for 10
minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

Magic traps such as *teleportation circle*are hard to detect and
disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use
the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is
25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of *teleportation circle*.

Teleport

**Teleport**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard
5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** personal and touch

**Target** you and touched objects or other touched willing
creatures

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none and [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates
(object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no and yes
(object)

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination,
which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level.
Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects
as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may
also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
(carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its
equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as
two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium
creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be
in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures
must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range
is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving
throw, nor is [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applicable to
you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person
receive saving throws and [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance).

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the
destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the
teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy
may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the
table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following
information for definitions of the terms on the table.

*Familiarity*: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been
very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a
place you know well, either because you can currently physically
see it or you've been there often. “Seen casually” is a place
that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very
familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once,
possibly using magic such as *[scrying](scrying.html#_scrying)*.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if
you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no
longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no
longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination,
roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling
d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive
at or even be off target from.

*On Target*: You appear where you want to be.

*Off Target*: You appear safely a random distance away from the
destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of
the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is
determined randomly.

*Similar Area*: You wind up in an area that's visually or
thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in
the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists
within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.

*Mishap*: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten
“scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll
on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll
1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more
damage and must reroll.

  Familiarity         On Target   Off Target   Similar Area   Mishap
  ------------------- ----------- ------------ -------------- --------
  Very familiar       01–97       98–99        100            —
  Studied carefully   01–94       95–97        98–99          100
  Seen casually       01–88       89–94        95–98          99–100
  Viewed once         01–76       77–88        89–96          97–100
  False destination   —           —            81–92          93–100

**Teleport, Greater**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard
7

This spell functions like *[teleport](#teleport),*except that
there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off
target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but
in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the
place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport
with insufficient information (or with misleading information),
you disappear and simply reappear in your original location.
Interplanar travel is not possible.

Teleport Object

**Teleport Object**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard
7

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu.
ft./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

This spell functions like
*[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport),*except that it teleports an
object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be
teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location
on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the
object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is
retrieved. A successful targeted *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell cast on that point
brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

Temporal Stasis

**Temporal Stasis**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered diamond, emerald, ruby, and
sapphire dust worth 5,000 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject
into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time
ceases to flow, and its condition becomes fixed. The creature
does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no
force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic
is removed (such as by a successful *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell or a
*[freedom](freedom.html#_freedom)*spell).

Time Stop

**Time Stop**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text

This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you.
In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem
frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal
speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time.
Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm
you. While the *time stop*is in effect, other creatures are
invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such
creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area
and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the
*time stop* have their normal effects on other creatures once the
*time stop*ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to
improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.

You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a
creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that
is not in another creature's possession.

You are undetectable while *time stop*lasts. You cannot enter an
area protected by an *[antimagic
field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field)*while under the
effect of *time stop.*

Tiny Hut

**Tiny Hut**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a small crystal bead)

**Range** 20 ft.

**Effect** 20-ft.-radius sphere centered on your location

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you
desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the
ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As
many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with
you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming
it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.

The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior
temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior temperature
below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature
on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection
against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut
withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane
(75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.

The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it
dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although
the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent
from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass
through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants
cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total
concealment).

Tongues

**Tongues**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 2, cleric 4,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, M/DF (a clay model of a ziggurat)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and
understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it
is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak
only one language at a time, although it may be able to
understand several languages. *Tongues*does not enable the
subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can
make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell
does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in
any way.

*Tongues*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Touch of Fatigue

**Touch of Fatigue**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the
target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target.
The subject is immediately [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued)
for the spell's duration.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued). Unlike with normal
fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

Touch of Idiocy

**Touch of Idiocy**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** no; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your
successful melee touch attack applies a 1d6 penalty to the
target's [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence),
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom), and
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) scores. This
penalty can't reduce any of these scores below 1.

This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast
some or all of its spells, if the requisite ability score drops
below the minimum required to cast spells of that level.

Transformation

**Transformation**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a *potion of [bull's
strength](bullSStrength.html#_bull-s-strength)*, which you drink
and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You become a fighting machine—stronger, tougher, faster, and more
skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat
and you can't cast spells, even from magic items.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength),
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), a +4
natural armor bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class), a +5
competence bonus on [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) saves,
and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base
attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you
multiple attacks).

You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use
spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the
spells were no longer on your class list.

Transmute Metal to Wood

**Transmute Metal to Wood**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** all metal objects within a 40-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (object;
see text)

This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its
area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by
creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal
effectively has [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) equal to 20 + its
caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted.
Weapons converted from metal to wood take a –2 penalty on attack
and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any armor converted from
metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell
splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and
armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor
bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or
20.

Only *[limited wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish),
[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle), [wish](wish.html#_wish),*or
similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic
state.

Transmute Mud to Rock

**Transmute Mud to Rock**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (sand, lime, and water)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell permanently transforms normal mud or quicksand of any
depth into soft stone (sandstone or a similar mineral).

Any creature in the mud is allowed a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save to escape before the area
is hardened to stone.

*Transmute mud to rock*counters and dispels *[transmute rock to
mud](transmuteRockToMud.html#_transmute-rock-to-mud)*.

Transmute Rock to Mud

**Transmute Rock to Mud**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** druid 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (clay and water)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

**Duration** permanent; see text

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort
into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the
spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A
creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from
the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5
feet and causing a –2 penalty on attack rolls and
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). Brush or similar material
thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of
it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through
the area at a speed of 5 feet.

If *transmute rock to mud*is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or
tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a
depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6
points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath
the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saves.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the
effect of the spell, since *transmute rock to mud*can't affect
worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such
buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures
often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even
partially toppled by this spell.

The mud remains until a successful *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*or *[transmute mud to
rock](transmuteMudToRock.html#_transmute-mud-to-rock)*spell
restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation
turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact
time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

Transport via Plants

**Transport via Plants**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** unlimited

**Target** you and touched objects or other touched willing
creatures

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can enter any normal plant (equal to your size or larger) and
pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round,
regardless of the distance separating the two. The plants must be
alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you. If you
are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination
plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the
*transport via plants*spell moves you as close as possible to the
desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired
but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected
from the entry plant.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't
exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional
willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up
to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels.
Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of
larger creatures you can bring along: a Large creature counts as
two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium
creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported by the
spell must be in physical contact with one another, and at least
one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.

The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures
you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried
objects from it.

Trap the Soul

**Trap the Soul**

**School** conjuration (summoning); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action or see text

**Components** V, S, M (gem worth 1,000 gp per HD of the trapped
creature)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** permanent; see text

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes; see text

*Trap the soul*forces a creature's life force (and its material
body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely
or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which
allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a
powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to
perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the
creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in
one of two ways.

*Spell Completion*: First, the spell can be completed by speaking
its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a
regular spell at the subject. This allows [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) (if any) and a
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save to avoid the effect. If the
creature's name is spoken as well, any [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) is ignored and
the save DC increases by 2. If the save or [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) is successful,
the gem shatters.

*Trigger Object*: The second method is far more insidious, for it
tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with
the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul
in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the
trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem
is enspelled. A *[sympathy](sympathy.html#_sympathy)*spell can
also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject
picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is
automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of
[spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) or a save.

Tree Shape

**Tree Shape**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree
or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs.
The exact type of tree, as well as its appearance, is completely
under your control. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal
that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed
creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub,
although a *[detect magic](detectMagic.html#_detect-magic)*spell
reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form,
you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you
were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses
remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) but have an effective
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) score of 0 and a
speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree
form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You
can dismiss *tree shape*as a free action (instead of as a
standard action).

Tree Stride

**Tree Stride**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** druid 5, ranger
4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until expended; see text

When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a
tree, magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a
tree, you can teleport from that particular tree to another tree.
The trees you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and
must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak
tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other
oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose
whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the
tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the
appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the
following table.

  Type of Tree      Transport Range
  ----------------- -----------------
  Oak, ash, yew     3,000 feet
  Elm, linden       2,000 feet
  Other deciduous   1,500 feet
  Any coniferous    1,000 feet

You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing
from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree).
The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree.
Each transport is a full-round action.

You can, at your option, remain within a tree without
transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell
ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or
burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is
complete.

True Resurrection

**True Resurrection**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 9

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Components**V, S, M, DF (diamond worth 25,000 gp)

This spell functions like *[raise
dead](raiseDead.html#_raise-dead),*except that you can resurrect
a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster
level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have
been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the
deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place
of birth or death is the most common method).

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately
restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) (or
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) points) and
all of the prepared spells possessed by the creature when it
died.

You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who
has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This
spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't
resurrect constructs or undead creatures.

Even *true resurrection*can't restore to life a creature who has
died of old age.

True Seeing

**True Seeing**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 5, druid 7,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (an eye ointment that costs 250 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they
actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical
darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact
locations of creatures or objects under
*[blur](blur.html#_blur)*or
*[displacement](displacement.html#_displacement)*effects, sees
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) creatures or objects
normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of
polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject
can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into
extradimensional spaces). The range of *true seeing*conferred is
120 feet.

*True seeing*, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in
no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate
concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. *True
seeing*does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises,
spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors
hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be
further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use *true
seeing*through a *crystal ball*or in conjunction with
*[clairaudience/clairvoyance](clairaudienceClairvoyance.html#_clairaudience-clairvoyance)*.

True Strike

**True Strike**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, F (small wooden replica of an archery target)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** see text

You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future
during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is
made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus.
Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that
applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.
