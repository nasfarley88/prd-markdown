**Rage**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one willing living creature per three levels, no two
of which may be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), a +1 morale
bonus on [Will](../combat.html#_will) saves, and a –2 penalty to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). The effect is otherwise
identical with a barbarian's rage except that the subjects aren't
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) at the end of the rage.

Rainbow Pattern

**Rainbow Pattern**

**School** illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V (bard only), S, M (a piece of phosphor), F (a
crystal prism); see text

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** Concentration +1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates
those within it. *Rainbow pattern*fascinates a maximum of 24 HD
of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the
spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected creature
that fails its saves is
[fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated) by the pattern.

With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the *rainbow
pattern* move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point
of origin). All [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated)
creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain
within the effect. [Fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated)
creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still
try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a
dangerous area, each [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated)
creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is
completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer
affected.

The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

Raise Dead

**Raise Dead**

**School**conjuration (healing); **Level**cleric 5

**Casting Time**1 minute

**Components**V, S, M (diamond worth 5,000 gp), DF

**Range**touch

**Target**dead creature touched

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**none, see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**yes (harmless)

You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature
that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In
addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return.
If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does
not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no
saving throw.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell
gains two permanent [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) when
it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining
creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) drain
instead (if this would reduce its
[Con](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) to 0 or less, it
can't be raised). A character who died with spells prepared has a
50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A
spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a
sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot
as if it had been used to cast a spell.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current
HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal
poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the
subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While
the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most
kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole.
Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is
brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or
possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed
by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs,
elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The
spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

Ray of Enfeeblement

**Ray of Enfeeblement**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) half;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a
ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a
penalty to [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) equal to
1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score cannot drop
below 1. A successful [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save
reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with
itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

Ray of Exhaustion

**Ray of Exhaustion**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed
on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted) for the spell's
duration. A successful [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude)
save means the creature is only
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued).

A character that is already
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) instead becomes
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted).

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted). Unlike normal
exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's
duration expires.

Ray of Frost

**Ray of Frost**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal
damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

Read Magic

**Read Magic**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level

You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls,
weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible.
This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in
the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or
trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have
read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read
that particular writing without recourse to the use of *read
magic.*You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per
minute. The spell allows you to identify a *[glyph of
warding](glyphOfWarding.html#_glyph-of-warding)*with a DC 13
Spellcraft check, a *greater glyph of warding*with a DC 16
Spellcraft check, or any *symbol*spell with a Spellcraft check
(DC 10 + spell level).

*Read magic*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Reduce Animal

**Reduce Animal**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** one willing animal of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge
size

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell functions like *[reduce
person](reducePerson.html#_reduce-person),*except that it affects
a single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal's
natural attacks as appropriate for its new size (see
[Equipment](../equipment.html) how to adjust damage for size).

Reduce Person

**Reduce Person**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature,
halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by
8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next
smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), a –2 size penalty
to [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) (to a minimum of
1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) due to its reduced size.

A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a
space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that
it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid
creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and
a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's
speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced
by the spell.

Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical
properties are not affected by this spell. Any *reduced*item that
leaves the *reduced*creature's possession (including a projectile
or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This
means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles
deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. *Reduce
person*counters and dispels *[enlarge
person](enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person)*.

*Reduce person*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

**Reduce Person, Mass**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Target** one humanoid creature/level, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[reduce person](#reduce-person)*,
except that it affects multiple creatures.

Refuge

**Refuge**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** cleric 7,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a prepared object worth 1,500 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Duration** permanent until discharged

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a
specially prepared object. This object contains the power to
instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the
same plane to your abode. Once the item is so enhanced, you must
give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of
a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of
the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time
that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this
is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and
carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are
instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are
affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion that is
touching the subject).

You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you
to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken
and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the
location and situation of the item possessor at the time the
*refuge*spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the
spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be
transported.

Regenerate

**Regenerate**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 7, druid 9

**Casting Time** 3 full rounds

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet,
arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures),
broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is
cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the
severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes
2d10 rounds otherwise.

*Regenerate*also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster
level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue,
and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has
no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).

Reincarnate

**Reincarnate**

**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 4

**Casting Time**10 minutes

**Components**V, S, M, DF (oils worth 1,000 gp)

**Range**touch

**Target**dead creature touched

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**none, see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**yes (harmless)

With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body,
provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the
casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing
to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the
spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return
receives no saving throw.

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical
ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains
is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's
body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion
receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at
the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new
young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural
elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the
body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life
and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks
it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save
bonuses, and hit points are unchanged.
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength),
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) scores
depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's
racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his
previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its
remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two
permanent [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) when
it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2
points of [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution)
drain instead (if this would reduce its
[Con](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) to 0 or less, it
can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared
has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being
reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells
(such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused
spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to
make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class.
If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a
multiclass character.

For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using
the table below. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of
creatures of the same type should be created.

A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed
by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell.
Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be
reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died
of old age.

The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its
new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor,
natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it
doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.

A *[wish](wish.html#_wish)*or a
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*spell can restore a
reincarnated character to his or her original form.

You can free one or more creatures from the effects of temporary
paralysis or related magic, including spells and effects that
cause a creature to gain the
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) condition. If the spell
is cast on one creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two
creatures, each receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus
against the effect that afflicts it. If cast on three or four
creatures, each receives another save with a +2 resistance bonus.

damage, or drain.

Repel Metal or Stone

**Repel Metal or Stone**

**School** abjuration [earth]; **Level** druid 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** 60-ft. line from you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell creates waves of invisible energy that roll forth from
you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are
pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or
stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects
weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else,
including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in
metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or
smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of
energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of
40 feet per round.

Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed
back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with
metal components are repelled, although an *[antimagic
field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field)*blocks the effects.
A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A
creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action
and drop it as a free action.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the
spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and
you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting
the spell's power.

Repel Vermin

**Repel Vermin**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4,
ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

An invisible barrier holds back vermin. A vermin with HD of less
than one-third your level cannot penetrate the barrier.

A vermin with HD of one-third your level or more can penetrate
the barrier if it succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will)
save. Even so, crossing the barrier deals the vermin 2d6 points
of damage, and pressing against the barrier causes pain, which
deters most vermin.

Repel Wood

**Repel Wood**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** 60-ft. line-shaped emanation from you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that
you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the
spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range.
Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed
firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches
in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and
break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects
affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per
round.

Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and
hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those
carrying them along. A creature being dragged by an item it is
carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can
loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action. If a
spear is planted (set) in a way that prevents this forced
movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are
repelled, although an *[antimagic
field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field)*blocks the effects.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the
spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and
you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting
the spell's power.

Repulsion

**Repulsion**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a pair of canine statuettes worth 50
gp)

**Range** up to 10 ft./level

**Area** up to 10-ft.-radius/level emanation centered on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures
from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time
of casting (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within
or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it
becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell.
Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They
can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with
ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature,
nothing happens. The creature is not forced back. The creature is
free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach.
If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn
back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within
the spell's area.

Resilient Sphere

**Resilient Sphere**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a crystal sphere)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a
creature

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the
creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the
sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration.
The sphere functions as a *[wall of
force](wallOfForce.html#_wall-of-force)*, except that it can be
negated by *[dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*. A
subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot
be physically moved either by people outside it or by the
struggles of those within.

Resistance

**Resistance**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a miniature cloak)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 minute

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from
harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves.

*Resistance*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Resist Energy

**Resist Energy**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage
of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10
against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the
creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or
magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being
applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the [energy
resistance](../glossary.html#_energy-resistance) granted
increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points
at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as
well.

*Resist energy*absorbs only damage. The subject could still
suffer unfortunate side effects.

*Resist energy*overlaps (and does not stack with) *[protection
from
energy](protectionFromEnergy.html#_protection-from-energy).*If a
character is warded by *[protection from
energy](protectionFromEnergy.html#_protection-from-energy)*and
*resist energy,*the *protection*spell absorbs damage until its
power is [exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted).

Restoration

**Restoration**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 4, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp or 1,000 gp,
see text)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

This spell functions like *[lesser
restoration](#restoration-lesser),* except that it also dispels
temporary [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or
one permanent negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a
permanent negative level, it has a material component of diamond
dust worth 1,000 gp. This spell cannot be used to dispel more
than one permanent [negative
level](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)possessed
by a target in a 1-week period.

*Restoration* cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores
all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your
choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any
fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

**Restoration, Greater**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 7

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust 5,000 gp)

This spell functions like *[lesser
restoration](#restoration-lesser),* except that it dispels all
permanent and temporary [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)
afflicting the healed creature. *Greater restoration* also
dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities,
cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points
permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates
fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity,
confusion, and similar mental effects.

**Restoration, Lesser**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 2, druid 2,
paladin 1

**Casting Time** 3 rounds

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

*Lesser restoration*dispels any magical effects reducing one of
the subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary
ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also
eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted) condition to
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued). It does not restore
permanent ability drain.

Resurrection

**Resurrection**

**School**conjuration (healing); **Level**cleric 7

**Components**V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF

This spell functions like *[raise
dead](raiseDead.html#_raise-dead),*except that you are able to
restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.

The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some
small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be
resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been
part of the creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of
a creature hit by a
*[disintegrate](disintegrate.html#_disintegrate)*spell count as a
small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no
longer than 10 years per caster level.

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately
restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of
prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent
[negative
level](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)when it
is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining
creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) drain
instead (if this would reduce its
[Con](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) to 0 or less, it
can't be resurrected).

You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who
has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You
cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs,
elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be resurrected.

Reverse Gravity

**Reverse Gravity**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (lodestone and iron filings)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached
objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the
top of the area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling)
is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike
it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward
fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area
without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating
slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration,
affected objects and creatures fall downward.

Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the
area can attempt a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save to
secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or
levitate can keep themselves from falling.

Righteous Might

**Righteous Might**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a
factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the
next larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) and take a
–2 penalty to your
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity). You gain a +2
enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/evil (if you normally
channel positive energy) or
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/good (if you normally
channel negative energy). At 15th level, this
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) becomes 10/evil or
10/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and attacks changes as
appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn't change
your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new
size.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you
attain the maximum possible size and may make a
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) check (using your
increased [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)) to burst
any enclosures in the process (see [Additional
Rules](../additionalRules.html) for rules on breaking objects).
If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials
enclosing you—the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the
spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties
are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves
your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon)
instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and
projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that
increase size do not stack.

Rope Trick

**Rope Trick**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered corn and a twisted loop of
parchment)

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched piece of rope from 5 ft. to 30 ft. long

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet
long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope
hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper
end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional
space that is outside the usual multiverse of extradimensional
spaces. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden,
beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those
spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight
creatures (of any size). The rope cannot be removed or hidden.
The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than
that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor
can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space
can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered
on the rope. The window is
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible), and even creatures that
can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the
extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope
can be climbed by only one person at a time. The *rope
trick*spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do
not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

Rusting Grasp

**Rusting Grasp**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** one nonmagical ferrous object (or the volume of the
object within 3 ft. of the touched point) or one ferrous creature

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the
item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a
3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic
items made of metal are immune to this spell.

You may employ *rusting grasp*in combat with a successful melee
touch attack. *Rusting grasp*used in this way instantaneously
destroys 1d6 points of [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) gained
from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor
offers) through corrosion.

Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more
difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack
against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed.
Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of
opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other
way around.

Against a ferrous creature, *rusting grasp*instantaneously deals
3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per
successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you
can make one melee touch attack per round.
