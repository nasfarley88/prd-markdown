**Acid Arrow**

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach), F
(a dart)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** one arrow of acid

**Duration** 1 round + 1 round per three levels

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

An arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target.
You must succeed on a [ranged touch
attack] to hit
your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no
splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the
acid, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum
of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4 points
of damage in each round.

Acid Fog

**Acid Fog**

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Acid fog*creates a billowing mass of misty vapors like the
*[solid fog]*spell. In addition to
slowing down creatures and obscuring sight, this spell's vapors
are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you
cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each
creature and object within it.

Acid Splash

**Acid Splash**

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one missile of acid

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a
ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points
of acid damage. This acid disappears after 1 round.

Aid

**Aid**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none;**[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

*Aid*grants the target a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and
saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to
1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+10 temporary hit points
at caster level 10th).

Air Walk

**Air Walk**

**School**transmutation [air]; **Level** cleric 4, druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground.
Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward
or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half
the air walker's normal speed.

A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) can push the subject along or
hold it back. At the end of a creature's turn each round, the
wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of
wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties
in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of
control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted
about.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60
feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that
amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the
distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since
dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends
in this way if the *air walk*spell is dispelled, but not if it is
negated by an *[antimagic
field]*.

You can cast *air walk*on a specially trained mount so it can be
ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the
aid of *air walk*(counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill)
with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Alarm

**Alarm**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 1, ranger 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a tiny bell and a piece of very fine
silver wire)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

A*larm*creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the
spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or
audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters
the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the
password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set
off the *alarm*. You decide at the time of casting whether the
*alarm*will be mental or audible in nature.

*Mental Alarm*: A mental *alarm*alerts you (and only you) so long
as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single
mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not
otherwise disturb concentration. A
*[silence]*spell has no effect on a mental
*alarm*.

*Audible Alarm*: An audible *alarm*produces the sound of a hand
bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it
clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing
closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.

In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as
180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a
*[silence]*spell cannot hear the ringing.

Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the *alarm*.

*Alarm*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Align Weapon

**Align Weapon**

**School** transmutation [see text]; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target**weapon touched or 50 projectiles (all of which must be
together at the time of casting)

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless,
object)

*Align weapon*makes a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as
you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the [damage
reduction] of certain
creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has
an alignment.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed
strike. When you make a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful,
*align weapon*is a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful spell,
respectively.

Alter Self

**Alter Self**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you
plan to assume)

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or
Medium creature of the humanoid type. If the form you assume has
any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability:
[darkvision] 60 feet, [low-light
vision],
[scent], and swim 30 feet.

*Small creature*: If the form you take is that of a Small
humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your
[Dexterity].

*Medium creature*: If the form you take is that of a Medium
humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your
[Strength].

Analyze Dweomer

**Analyze Dweomer**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a ruby and gold lens worth 1,500 gp)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one object or creature per caster level

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none or [Will] negates,
see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You can observe magical auras. Each round, you may examine a
single creature or object that you can see as a free action. In
the case of a magic item, you learn its functions (including any
curse effects), how to activate its functions (if appropriate),
and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case
of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you
learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.

An attended object may attempt a [Will]
save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save
succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can
discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be
affected by any other *analyze dweomer*spells for 24 hours.

*Analyze dweomer*does not function when used on an artifact.

Animal Growth

**Animal Growth**

**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 5, ranger 4,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target**one animal (Gargantuan or smaller)

**Duration**1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times
its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal's size
category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to
[Strength] and a +4 size bonus
to [Constitution] (and thus
an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a –2 size penalty to
[Dexterity]. The creature's
existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also
affects the animal's modifier to
[AC], attack rolls, and its base
damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the
new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is
available for the desired growth, the creature attains the
maximum possible size and may make a
[Strength] check (using its
increased [Strength]) to burst
any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained
without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be
used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by the animal is similarly enlarged
by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical
properties of any such equipment.

Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession
instantly returns to its normal size.

The spell gives no means of command over an enlarged animal.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

Animal Messenger

**Animal Messenger**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, druid 2, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a morsel of food the animal likes)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one Tiny animal

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most
common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message
to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by
someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal
companions.

Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you
call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You
can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to
you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple,
because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a
destination on its own. You can attach a small item or note to
the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location
and waits there until the duration of the spell expires,
whereupon it resumes its normal activities.

During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to
approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The
intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with
the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a
language he doesn't know, for example).

Animal Shapes

**Animal Shapes**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**druid 8

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, DF

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets**up to one willing creature per level, all within 30
ft. of each other.

**Duration**1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw**none, see text; **[Spell
Resistance]**yes (harmless)

As *[beast shape III]*, except
you change the form of up to one willing creature per caster
level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on
unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of
animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell
expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition,
an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a
full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject
alone.

Animal Trance

**Animal Trance**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic];
**Level** bard 2, druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** animals or magical beasts with
[Intelligence] 1 or 2

**Duration** concentration

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel
animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a
creature with an
[Intelligence] score of 1
or 2 can be [fascinated] by this
spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of
creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected
first until no more targets within range can be affected.

Animate Dead

**Animate Dead**

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard
4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (an onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit
Die of the undead)

**Range** touch

**Targets** one or more corpses touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell turns corpses into undead skeletons or zombies that
obey your spoken commands.

The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to
remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific
kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until
they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be
animated again.

Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you
can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with
a single casting of *animate dead*. The
*[desecrate]*spell doubles this limit.

The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No
matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can
control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If
you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall
under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings
become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released.
Undead you control through the [Command
Undead] feat do not count toward
this limit.

*Skeletons*: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact
corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is
made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.

*Zombies*: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact
corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a physical
anatomy.

Animate Objects

**Animate Objects**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 6, cleric 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one Small object per caster level; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of
life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever
or whatever you initially designate.

An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may
animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of
larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or
smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight,
a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can
change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if
directing an active spell.

This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

*Animate objects*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Animate Plants

**Animate Plants**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one Large plant per three caster levels or all plants
within range; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life.
Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever
you initially designate as though it were an animated object of
the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or
smaller plant, or a number of larger plants as follows: a Huge
plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant
as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the
designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an
active spell.

Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants
smaller than Large don't have hardness.

*Animate plants*cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect
nonliving vegetable material.

*Entangle*: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range
with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around
creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the
effect of an *[entangle]*spell. [Spell
resistance] does not keep
creatures from being [entangled].
This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

Animate Rope

**Animate Rope**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one rope-like object, length up to 50 ft. + 5
ft./level; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none;**[Spell
Resistance]** no

You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length
assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length
by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by
50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.

The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack),
“coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the
opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can
give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an
active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of
it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the
intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch
attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter
hemp rope has 2 hit points, [AC] 10,
and requires a DC 23 [Strength]
check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be
used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a
[Reflex] saving throw to become
[entangled]. A creature capable of
spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a
concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level to cast a
spell. An [entangled] creature can
slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

Antilife Shell

**Antilife Shell**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 6, druid 6

**Components** V, S, DF

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that
prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures.

The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants,
humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants,
and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.

This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively.
Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell
keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

Antimagic Field

**Antimagic Field**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (pinch of powdered iron or iron
filings)

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** see text

An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space
within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects,
including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural
abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic
items or spells within its confines.

An *antimagic field*suppresses any spell or magical effect used
within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel
it. Time spent within an *antimagic field*counts against the
suppressed spell's duration.

Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an
*antimagic field.*They reappear in the same spot once the field
goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the
duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If
you cast *antimagic field*in an area occupied by a summoned
creature that has [spell
resistance], you must make a
caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's
[spell resistance] to make it
wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not
affected by an *antimagic field*because the conjuration itself is
no longer in effect, only its result.)

A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles.
Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically
within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at
that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs
that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are
thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in
which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures).
Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless
summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities
may be temporarily nullified by the field. *[Dispel
magic]*does not remove the field.

Two or more *antimagic fields*sharing any of the same space have
no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as *[wall of
force], [prismatic
sphere]*, and *[prismatic
wall],*remain unaffected by
*antimagic field*. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal
magic such as this.

Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the
barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is
unaffected by the field.

Antipathy

**Antipathy**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a lump of alum soaked in vinegar)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] partial; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations
that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or
creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind
of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature
subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment
to be repelled must be named.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to
leave the area or to avoid the affected item.

A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it
and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect.
A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the
area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This
distracting discomfort reduces the creature's
[Dexterity] score by 4 points.

*Antipathy*counters and dispels
*[sympathy]*.

Antiplant Shell

**Antiplant Shell**

**School** abjuration; **Level** druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

The *antiplant shell*spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier
that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks
by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration
spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell
keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.

Arcane Eye

**Arcane Eye**

**School** divination (scrying); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)

**Range** unlimited

**Effect**magical sensor

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual
information. You can create the *arcane eye*at any point you can
see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without
hindrance. An *arcane eye*travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet
per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily
looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute)
if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It
sees exactly as you would see if you were there.

The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts.
Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole
or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter
another plane of existence, even through a
*[gate]*or similar magical portal.

You must concentrate to use an *arcane eye.*If you do not
concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.

Arcane Lock

**Arcane Lock**

**School**abjuration; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)

**Range**touch

**Target**door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level
in size

**Duration**permanent

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

An *arcane lock*spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal
magically locks it. You can freely pass your own *arcane
lock*without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the
DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to
the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell
creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device
skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be
opened only by breaking in or with a successful *[dispel
magic]*or
*[knock]*spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to
break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A
*[knock]*spell does not remove an *arcane
lock;*it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.

Arcane Mark

**Arcane Mark**

**School** universal; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Effect** one personal rune or mark, all of which must fit
within 1 sq. ft.

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark,
which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can
be visible or invisible. An *arcane mark*spell enables you to
etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material
upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *[detect
magic]*spell causes it to glow
and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

*[See invisibility],
[true seeing]*, a *gem of seeing*,
or a *robe of eyes*likewise allows the user to see an invisible
*arcane mark.*A *[read magic]*spell
reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it
can be removed by the caster or by an *erase*spell.

If an *arcane mark*is placed on a living being, the effect
gradually fades in about a month.

*Arcane mark*must be cast on an object prior to casting *[instant
summons]*on the same object
(see that spell description for details).

Arcane Sight

**Arcane Sight**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see
magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to
that of a *[detect magic]*spell,
but *arcane sight*does not require concentration and discerns
aura location and power more quickly.

You know the location and power of all magical auras within your
sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or
an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the
*[detect magic]*spell. If the
items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you
can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic
involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level,
or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you
as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any
spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or
divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the
strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the
creature currently has available for use.

As with *[detect magic],* you can
use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not
artifacts.

*Arcane sight*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

**Arcane Sight, Greater**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions like *[arcane sight],*except
that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are
active upon any individual or object you see.

Unlike *[arcane sight]*, this spell cannot be made
permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Astral Projection

**Astral Projection**

**School**necromancy; **Level**cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 30 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (1,000 gp jacinth)

**Range** touch

**Targets** you plus one additional willing creature touched per
two caster levels

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows
you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You
can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you,
provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at
the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent
upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something
happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded
wherever you left them.

You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your
physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of
suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and
all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral
Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any
of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the
Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the
plane of existence you have chosen to enter.

While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected
at all times to your physical body by an
[incorporeal] silver cord. If the
cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily,
very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is
formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly
attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form
is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on
the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of
suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you
gain two permanent [negative
levels] if
your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral
projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a
physical body must be materialized on other planes.

You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane
indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of
suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to
them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is
terminated by some outside means, such as *[dispel
magic]*cast upon either the
physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver
cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane
(which kills you).

When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear,
vanishes.

Atonement

**Atonement**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 5, druid 5

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M (burning incense), F (a set of prayer
beads or other prayer device worth at least 500 gp), DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The
creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous
of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed
the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion,
*atonement*operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the
case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must
intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in
rare incense and offerings). *Atonement*may be cast for one of
several purposes, depending on the version selected.

*Reverse Magical Alignment Change*: If a creature has had its
alignment magically changed, *atonement*returns its alignment to
its original status at no additional cost.

*Restore Class*: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her
class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her
class may have her class features restored by this spell.

*Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers*: A cleric or druid who has
lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her
deity may regain that ability by seeking *atonement*from another
cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression
was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare
incense and offerings for her god's intercession.

*Redemption or Temptation*: You may cast this spell upon a
creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance
to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject
must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion
of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its
original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to
your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can
force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if
it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the
spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of
changing its alignment naturally.

Though the spell description refers to evil acts, *atonement*can
be used on any creature that has performed acts against its
alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.

*Note*: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This
use of *atonement*offers a method for a character to change his
or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.

Augury

**Augury**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (incense worth at least 25 gp), F (a set
of marked sticks or bones worth at least 25 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

An *augury*can tell you whether a particular action will bring
good or bad results for you in the immediate future.

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per
caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A
question may be so straightforward that a successful result is
automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the
*augury*succeeds, you get one of four results:

-   Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
-   Woe (for bad results).
-   Weal and woe (for both).
-   Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad
    results).

If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who
gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the
consequence of a failed or successful *augury.*

The *augury*can see into the future only about half an hour, so
anything that might happen after that does not affect the result.
Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term
consequences of a contemplated action. All *auguries*cast by the
same person about the same topic use the same die result as the
first casting.

Awaken

**Awaken**

**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 5

**Casting Time**24 hours

**Components**V, S, M (herbs and oils worth 2,000 gp), DF

**Range**touch

**Target** animal or tree touched

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed,
you must make a [Will] save (DC 10 + the
animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened).
The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no
special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken,
although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you
communicate your desires to it. If you cast *awaken* again, any
previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no
longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best
interests.

An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated
object, except that it gains the plant type and its
[Intelligence],
[Wisdom], and
[Charisma] scores are each
3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs,
roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar
to a human's.

An awakened animal gets 3d6
[Intelligence], +1d3
[Charisma], and +2 HD. Its
type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal
can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know,
plus one additional language that you know per point of
[Intelligence] bonus (if
any). This spell does not function on an animal or plant with an
[Intelligence] greater than
2.
