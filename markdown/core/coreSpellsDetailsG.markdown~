**Gaseous Form**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S, M/DF (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)

**Range** touch

**Target**willing corporeal creature touched

**Duration** 2 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and
translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes
worthless, though its size,
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), deflection
bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The
subject gains [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 10/magic
and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.
It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or
focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out
the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared
using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.
The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous
form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is
discharged harmlessly when the *gaseous form*spell takes effect.

A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10
feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can
pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks,
with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the
spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind,
and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't
manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along
with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active,
though in some cases their effects may be moot.

Gate

**Gate**

**School** conjuration (creation or calling); **Level** cleric 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (see text)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** see text

**Duration** instantaneous or concentration (up to 1
round/level); see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Casting a *gate*spell has two effects. First, it creates an
interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a
plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in
either direction.

Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of
being through the *gate.*

The *gate*itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in
diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire
when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you).
It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you
specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that
moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.

A *gate*has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the
*gate*from the front are transported to the other plane;
creatures moving through it from the back are not.

*Planar Travel*: As a mode of planar travel, a *gate*spell
functions much like a *[plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift)*spell, except that the
*gate*opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation
effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can
prevent a *gate*from opening in their presence or personal
demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with
you—anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported.
A *gate*cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the
spell works only for interplanar travel.

You may hold the *gate*open only for a brief time (no more than 1
round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or
else the interplanar connection is severed.

*Calling Creatures*: The second effect of the *gate*spell is to
call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By
naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell,
you cause the *gate*to open in the immediate vicinity of the
desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or
unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to
come through the *gate,*although they may choose to do so of
their own accord. This use of the spell creates a *gate*that
remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures.
This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare
incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that
must be paid to the called creatures.

If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known
individual, you may call either a single creature or several
creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice
your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can
control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A
creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled.
Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An
uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such
creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to
its home plane at any time.

If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service
from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return
for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with
respect to the promised favor or reward; see the *[lesser planar
ally](planarAlly.html#_planar-ally-lesser)*spell for appropriate
rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock”
rather than in coin, which could involve complications.
Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is
transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn
over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is
instantly freed to return to its own plane.

Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your
being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and
master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may
attack you.

*Note*: When you use a calling spell such as *gate*to call an
air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature,
it becomes a spell of that type.

Geas/Quest

**Geas, Lesser**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature with 7 HD or less

**Duration** 1 day/level or until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A *lesser geas*places a magical command on a creature to carry
out some service or to refrain from some action or course of
activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD
and be able to understand you. While a *geas*cannot compel a
creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in
certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The *geased*creature must follow the given instructions until the
*geas*is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the
recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell
remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A
clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *lesser geas*for 24
hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each
day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No
ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The
ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject
resumes obeying the *lesser geas.*

A *lesser geas*(and all ability score penalties) can be ended by
*[break enchantment](breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment)*,
*[limited wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish)*, *[remove
curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*,
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*, or *[wish](wish.html#_wish)*.
*[Dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*does not affect a
*lesser geas*.

**Geas/Quest**

**School**enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level**bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time**10 minutes

**Target**one living creature

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**yes

This spell functions similarly to *lesser geas,*except that it
affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the *geas/quest*for 24
hours, it takes a –3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each
day, another –3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –12. No
ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The
ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject
resumes obeying the *geas/quest.*

A *[remove curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*spell ends a
*geas/quest*spell only if its caster level is at least two higher
than your caster level. *[Break
enchantment](breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment)*does not
end a *geas/quest*, but *[limited
wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish)*,
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*, and
*[wish](wish.html#_wish)*do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as
*geas,*while clerics call the same spell *quest*.

Gentle Repose

**Gentle Repose**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (salt and a copper piece for each of
the corpse's eyes)

**Range** touch

**Target** corpse touched

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not
decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising
that creature from the dead (see *[raise
dead](raiseDead.html#_raise-dead)*). Days spent under the
influence of this spell don't count against the time limit.
Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus
decaying) comrade less unpleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

Ghost Sound

**Ghost Sound**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard
0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a bit of wool or a small lump of wax)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** illusory sounds

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

*Ghost sound*allows you to create a volume of sound that rises,
recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what
type of sound *ghost sound*creates when casting it and cannot
thereafter change the sound's basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can
produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level
(maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking,
marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a *ghost
sound*spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within
the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about
the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring
lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon
is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a *ghost
sound* receives a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save to
disbelieve.

*Ghost sound*can enhance the effectiveness of a *[silent
image](silentImage.html#_silent-image)*spell.

*Ghost sound*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Ghoul touch

**Ghoul touch**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (cloth from a ghoul or earth from a
ghoul's lair)

**Range** touch

**Target** living humanoid touched

**Duration** 1d6+2 rounds

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to
paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell
with a successful melee touch attack.

A [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) subject exudes a
carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a
10-foot-radius spread to become
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened)
([Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates). A *[neutralize
poison](neutralizePoison.html#_neutralize-poison)*spell removes
the effect from a [sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened)
creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the
stench. This is a poison effect.

Giant Form

**Giant Form I**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you
plan to assume)

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Large
humanoid creature of the giant subtype. Once you assume your new
form, you gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength), a –2 penalty to
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), a +4 size bonus
to [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), a +4
natural armor bonus, and [low-light
vision](../glossary.html#_low-light-vision). If the form you
assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed
ability: [darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) 60 feet, rend
(2d6 damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing
(range 60 feet, 2d6 damage). If the creature has immunity or
resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those
elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you
gain that vulnerability.

**Giant Form II**

**School**Transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions as *[giant form I](#giant-form-i)*except
that it also allows you to assume the form of any Huge creature
of the giant type. You gain the following abilities: a +8 size
bonus to [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength), a –2
penalty to [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), a +6
size bonus to
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), a +6
natural armor bonus, [low-light
vision](../glossary.html#_low-light-vision), and a +10 foot
enhancement bonus to your speed. If the form you assume has any
of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: swim 60
feet, [darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) 60 feet, rend
(2d8 damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing
(range 120 feet, 2d10 damage). If the creature has immunity or
resistance to one element, you gain that immunity or resistance.
If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that
vulnerability.

Giant Vermin

**Giant Vermin**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 4, druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** 1 or more vermin, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or
spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin
can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a
centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be
affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on
the table below.

Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you,
but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands
(“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a
certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular
occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless
commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or
whatever is near them.

  Caster Level     Centipedes   Scorpions   Spiders
  ---------------- ------------ ----------- ---------
  9th or lower     3            1           2
  10th–13th        4            2           3
  14th–17th        6            3           4
  18th–19th        8            4           5
  20th or higher   12           6           8

Glibness

**Glibness**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who
hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on
Bluff checks made to convince another of the truth of your words.
This bonus doesn't apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such
as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or
communicating a hidden message via innuendo.

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your
lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must
succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a
DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect
does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

Glitterdust

**Glitterdust**

**School**conjuration (creation); **Level**bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (ground mica)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area**creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread

**Duration**1 round/level

**Save**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (blinding only);
**SR**no

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the
area, causing creatures to become
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) and visibly outlining
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) things for the duration
of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which
cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each
round at the end of their turn
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) creatures may attempt new
saving throws to end the blindness effect.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Stealth
checks.

Globe of Invulnerability

**Globe of Invulnerability**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions like *[lesser globe of
invulnerability](#globe-of-invulnerability-lesser),*except that
it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.

**Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)

**Range** 10 ft.

**Area** 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and
excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or
effect of any such spells does not include the area of the
*[lesser globe of
invulnerability](#globe-of-invulnerability-lesser)*. Such spells
fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded
effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like
effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast
through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and
higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in
effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a
*[dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell*.*You can
leave and return to the globe without penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects
enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not
dispelled.

If a given spell has more than one level depending on which
character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the
caster to determine whether *[lesser globe of
invulnerability](#globe-of-invulnerability-lesser)*stops it.

Glyph of Warding

**Glyph of Warding**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target or Area** object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level

**Duration** permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no (object) and
yes; see text

This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open
the warded area or object. A *glyph of warding*can guard a bridge
or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.

You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any
creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object
without speaking a password (which you set when casting the
spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in
addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to
physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature
type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to
good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion.
They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs
respond to [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) creatures
normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them
ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area.
However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be
separately warded.

When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing
lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform
to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage.
When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly
invisible.

Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical
or magical probing, though they can be dispelled.
*[Mislead](mislead.html#_mislead)*,
*[polymorph](polymorph.html#_polymorph)*, and
*[nondetection](nondetection.html#_nondetection)*(and similar
magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises
and the like can't. *[Read
magic](readMagic.html#_read-magic)*allows you to identify a
*glyph of warding*with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check.
Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to
know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage
caused, what spell is stored).

*Note*: Magic traps such as *glyph of warding*are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find
the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is
25 + spell level, or 28 for *glyph of warding*.

Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the
intruder or activates a spell.

*Blast Glyph*: A *blast glyph*deals 1d8 points of damage per two
caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5
feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity,
or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each
creature affected can attempt a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex)
save to take half damage. [Spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applies against
this effect.

*Spell Glyph*: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or
lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell
are based on your caster level at the time of casting the
glyph*.*If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If
the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect
is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they
appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving
throws and [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)
operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of
the spell stored in the glyph.

**Glyph of Warding, Greater**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 6

This spell functions like *[glyph of
warding](#glyph-of-warding),*except that a *greater blast
glyph*deals up to 10d8 points of damage, and a *greater spell
glyph*can store a spell of 6th level or lower.

*[Read magic](readMagic.html#_read-magic)* allows you to identify
a *greater glyph of warding* with a DC 16 Spellcraft check.

*Material Component*: You trace the glyph with incense, which
must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 400
gp.

Goodberry

**Goodberry**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** 2d4 fresh berries touched

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Casting *goodberry*makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You
(as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can
immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted
berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a
Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when
eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any
24-hour period.

Good Hope

**Good Hope**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one living creature/level, no two of which may be
more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

This spell instills powerful hope in the subjects. Each affected
creature gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls,
ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

*Good hope* counters and dispels *[crushing
despair](crushingDespair.html#_crushing-despair).*

Grasping Hand

**Grasping Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*, except that it
can also grapple one opponent you select. The *grasping hand*
gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke
an attack of opportunity. Its
[CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) and
[CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) for grapple checks
use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a
+10 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)
(31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) is 10, granting no
bonus on the [Combat Maneuver
Defense](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense)). The hand
holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the
spell to a new target is a move action. The *grasping hand* can
instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses
outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as
*[interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*
does.

Grease

**Grease**

**School**conjuration (creation); **Level**bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (butter)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one object or 10-ft. square

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

**Save**see text; **SR**no

A *grease*spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery
grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make
a successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save or fall. A
creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half
normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it
can't move that round (and must then make a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save or fall), while failure by
5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details).
Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this
check and are not considered
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed).

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell,
while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its
bearer to make a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving throw to
avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature
immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each
round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the
*greased*item. A creature wearing *greased*armor or clothing
gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat
maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their
[CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) to avoid being
[grappled](../glossary.html#_grappled).

Guards and Wards

**Guards and Wards**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 30 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of
brimstone and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of
blood), F (a small silver rod)

**Range** anywhere within the area to be warded

**Area** up to 200 sq. ft./level (S)

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** see text

This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or
fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The
ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area
can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can
ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among
them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast
the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within
the warded area.

*Fog*: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A
creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
Saving Throw: none. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

*Arcane Locks*: All doors in the warded area are *[arcane
lock](arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock)ed.*Saving Throw: none. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

*Webs*: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands
are identical with those created by the
*[web](web.html#_web)*spell, except that they regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while the *guards and
wards*spell lasts. Saving Throw: [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex)
negates; see text for *[web](web.html#_web)*. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

*Confusion*: Where there are choices in direction—such as a
corridor intersection or side passage—a minor *confusion-*type
effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders
believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one
they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving
Throw: none. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): yes.

*Lost Doors*: One door per caster level is covered by a *[silent
image](silentImage.html#_silent-image)*to appear as if it were a
plain wall. Saving Throw: [Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief
(if interacted with). [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following
five magical effects.

​1. *[Dancing lights](dancingLights.html#_dancing-lights)*in four
corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the
lights to repeat as long as the *guards and wards*spell lasts.
Saving Throw: none. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

​2. A *[magic mouth](magicMouth.html#_magic-mouth)*in two places.
Saving Throw: none. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

​3. A *[stinking cloud](stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud)*in
two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they
return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the *guards
and wards*spell lasts. Saving Throw:
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates; see text for
*[stinking cloud](stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud).*[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): no.

​4. A *[gust of wind](gustOfWind.html#_gust-of-wind)*in one
corridor or room. Saving Throw:
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): yes.

​5. A *[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*in one place.
You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who
enters or passes through the area receives the
*[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*mentally. Saving
Throw: [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates. [Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance): yes.

The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration
school. A *[dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*cast on
a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A
successful *[mage's
disjunction](mageSDisjunction.html#_mage-s-disjunction)*destroys
the entire *guards and wards*effect.

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph)
that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path.
All flying creatures in this area take a –4 penalty on Fly skill
checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly
skill check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of
damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly
skill check to move against the force of the wind.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and
rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per
10 feet.

Small creatures are knocked [prone](../glossary.html#_prone) by
the force of the wind.

Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against
the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) check.

Large or larger creatures may move normally within a *gust of
wind*effect.

This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged
attacks and Perception checks in the area of a *gust of wind*.

The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles,
torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected
flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50%
chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a *gust of wind*can do anything
that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can
create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire,
overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat,
and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

*Gust of wind*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.
