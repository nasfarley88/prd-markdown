**Obscure Object**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 1, cleric 3,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (chameleon skin)

**Range** touch

**Target** one object touched of up to 100 lbs./level

**Duration** 8 hours (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying)
effects, such as the *[scrying](scrying.html#_scrying)*spell or a
*crystal ball*. Such an attempt automatically fails (if the
divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the
object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location,
object, or person).

Obscuring Mist

**Obscuring Mist**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 1, druid 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 20 ft.

**Effect** cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor
obscures all sight, including
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A
creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a *[gust of
wind](gustOfWind.html#_gust-of-wind)*spell, disperses the fog in
4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A
*[fireball](fireball.html#_fireball), [flame
strike](flameStrike.html#_flame-strike)*, or similar spell burns
away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A *[wall of
fire](wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire)*burns away the fog in the
area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

Open/Close

**Open/Close**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a brass key)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** object weighing up to 30 lbs. or portal that can be
opened or closed

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window,
bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything
resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a
chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and
close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and
similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this
spell's ability to affect.

Order's Wrath

**Order's Wrath**

**School** evocation [lawful]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** nonlawful creatures within a burst that fills a 30-ft.
cube

**Duration** instantaneous (1 round); see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the
form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and
neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels
(maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per
caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them
to be [dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed) for 1 round. A successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save reduces the damage to half and
negates the daze effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither
chaotic nor lawful, and they are not
[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed). They can reduce the damage in
half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save.

Overland Flight

**Overland Flight**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Components**: V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like a *[fly](fly.html)*spell, except you
can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy
armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly) skill checks equal to half your
caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement,
you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march
still requires
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) checks).
This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight
(or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).

Owl's Wisdom

**Owl's Wisdom**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2,
ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an owl)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4
enhancement bonus to [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom),
adding the usual benefit to
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)-related skills. Clerics,
druids, and rangers (and other
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)-based spellcasters) who
receive *owl's wisdom*do not gain any additional bonus spells for
the increased [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom), but the
save DCs for their spells increase.

**Owl's Wisdom, Mass**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 6, druid 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[owl's wisdom](#owl-s-wisdom)*, except
that it affects multiple creatures.
