**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);

The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and
personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to
[Charisma], adding the
usual benefits to
[Charisma]-based skill
checks and other uses of the
[Charisma] modifier. Bards,
paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on
[Charisma]) affected by
this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the
increased [Charisma], but
the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect
do increase.

Earthquake

**Earthquake**

**School** evocation [earth]; **Level** cleric 8, druid 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** 80-ft.-radius spread (S)

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

When you cast *earthquake,*an intense but highly localized tremor
rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell
knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the
ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time
creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on
the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level)
or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects
all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area.
The specific effect of an *earthquake*spell depends on the nature
of the terrain where it is cast.

*Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel*: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points
of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in
([Reflex] DC 15 half) and pinning that
creature beneath the rubble (see below). An *earthquake*cast on
the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside
the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.

*Cliffs*:*Earthquake*causes a cliff to crumble, creating a
landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls
vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of
bludgeoning damage ([Reflex] DC 15 half)
and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).

*Open Ground*: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC
15 [Reflex] save or fall down. Fissures
open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25%
chance to fall into one ([Reflex] DC 20
to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of
the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures
as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without
air (see [Environment] for more details).

*Structure*: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100
points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry
building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced
masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved
as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught
inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning
damage ([Reflex] DC 15 half) and is
pinned beneath the rubble (see below).

*River, Lake, or Marsh*: Fissures open under the water, draining
away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy
marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the
spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in
the area must make a DC 15 [Reflex] save
or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell,
the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained
water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.

*Pinned Beneath Rubble*: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes
1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a
pinned character falls
[unconscious], he or she must make
a DC 15 [Constitution]
check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter
until freed or dead.

When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of a Small air,

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as *[elemental body
II],*except that it also allows you to assume
the form of a Large air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The
abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which
you change. You are also immune to bleed damage, critical hits,

Elemental Swarm

**Elemental Swarm**

**School** conjuration (summoning) [see text]; **Level** druid 9

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** two or more summoned creatures, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons
elementals from it. A druid can choose any plane (Air, Earth,
Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching
his domain.

When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten
minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after
that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum
hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you
for the duration of the spell.

The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if
someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need
to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can
dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or
water creature, it is a spell of that type.

Endure Elements

**Endure Elements**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 24 hours

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

A creature protected by *endure elements*suffers no harm from
being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in
conditions between –50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having
to make [Fortitude] saves. The
creature's equipment is likewise protected.

*Endure elements*doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold
damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards
such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.

Energy Drain

**Energy Drain**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] partial;
see text for *[enervation]*

This spell functions like
*[enervation],*except that the
creature struck gains 2d4 temporary [negative
levels].
Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a
[Fortitude] saving throw (DC = *energy
drain*spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save
succeeds, that [negative
level]is
removed. If it fails, that [negative
level]becomes
permanent.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4 × 5 temporary hit
points for 1 hour.

Enervation

**Enervation**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray of negative energy

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy
that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes.
You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the
subject gains 1d4 temporary [negative
levels] (see
[Special
Abilities]).
[Negative
levels]
stack.

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a
number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours).
Usually, [negative
levels] have
a chance of becoming permanent, but the [negative
levels] from
*enervation*don't last long enough to do so.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 × 5 temporary hit
points for 1 hour.

Enlarge Person

**Enlarge Person**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, M (powdered iron)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling
its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes
the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target
gains a +2 size bonus to
[Strength], a –2 size penalty
to [Dexterity] (to a minimum
of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and
[AC] due to its increased size.

A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of
10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not
change the target's speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the
creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a
[Strength] check (using its
increased [Strength]) to burst
any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained
without harm by the materials enclosing it—the spell cannot be
used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged
by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more
damage (see [Table: Tiny and Large Weapon
Damage]).
Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any
*enlarged*item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession
(including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to
its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons
deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items
are not increased by this spell.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

*Enlarge person*counters and dispels *[reduce
person]*.

*Enlarge person*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

**Enlarge Person, Mass**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Target** One humanoid creature/level, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[enlarge person]*,
except that it affects multiple creatures.

Entangle

**Entangle**

**School**transmutation; **Level**druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, DF

**Range**long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area**plants in a 40-ft.-radius spread

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**: [Reflex] partial; see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**:
no

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap
around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the
area. Creatures that fail their save gain the
[entangled] condition. Creatures
that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in
the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that
move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must
end their movement and gain the
[entangled] condition.
[Entangled] creatures can attempt to
break free as a move action, making a
[Strength] or Escape Artist
check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The
entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the
effect lasts.

If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the
area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against
the *entangle* or fail a check made to break free. Other effects,
depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM
discretion.

Enthrall

**Enthrall**

**School** enchantment (charm) [language dependent,
mind-affecting, sonic]; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** any number of creatures

**Duration** 1 hour or less

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use
this spell to hold them enthralled. To cast the spell, you must
speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter,
those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their
surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly
while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected
creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4
bonus on the saving throw.

A target with 4 or more HD or with a
[Wisdom] score of 16 or higher
remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of
indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions
that it opposes.

The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1
hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you
speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss
the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the
performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The
speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose
concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.

If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes
toward you, they can collectively make a
[Charisma] check to try to
end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the
[Charisma] bonus of the
creature with the highest
[Charisma] in the group;
others may make [Charisma]
checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check
result beats your
[Charisma] check result.
Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.

If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some
other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously
enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each
creature with 4 or more HD or with a
[Wisdom] score of 16 or higher
becomes hostile.

Entropic Shield

**Entropic Shield**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast
of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays,
and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for
which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance
(similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that
simply work at a distance are not affected.

Erase

**Erase**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one scroll or two pages

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Erase*removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from
a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar
surfaces. With this spell, you can remove *[explosive
runes],*a *[glyph of
warding],*a *[sepia snake
sigil],*or an *[arcane
mark]*, but not *[illusory
script]*or a *symbol*spell.
Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no
one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing
nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must
succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC
15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to
erase *[explosive runes]*,
a *[glyph of warding]*, or
a *[sepia snake sigil]*,
you accidentally activate that writing instead.

Ethereal Jaunt

**Ethereal Jaunt**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration
of the spell, you are in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the
Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material
existence.

An ethereal creature is [invisible],
insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or
down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature,
you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.
An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but
everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the
Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature
normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't
attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal
affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or
objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.

Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they
were material.

If you end the spell and become material while inside a material
object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest
open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so
travel.

Etherealness

**Etherealness**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Range** touch; see text

**Targets** you and one other touched creature per three levels

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**[Spell Resistance]** yes

This spell functions like *[ethereal
jaunt],*except that you and
other willing creatures joined by linked hands (along with their
equipment) become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one
creature per three caster levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once
ethereal, the subjects need not stay together.

When the spell expires, all affected creatures on the Ethereal
Plane return to material existence.

Expeditious Retreat

**Expeditious Retreat**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This
adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect
on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.
As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects
your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

Explosive Runes

**Explosive Runes**

**School** abjuration [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.

**Duration** permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar
object bearing written information. The *explosive runes*detonate
when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the
*explosive runes*(close enough to read them) takes the full
damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of
the *explosive runes*is entitled to a
[Reflex] save for half damage. The object
on which the *explosive runes*were written also takes full damage
(no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the
protected writing without triggering the *explosive
runes.*Likewise, you can remove the *explosive runes*whenever
desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful
*[dispel magic]*or *erase*spell,
but attempting to dispel or erase the *explosive runes*and
failing to do so triggers the explosion.

Magic traps such as *explosive runes*are hard to detect and
disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only)
can use Disable Device to thwart *explosive runes*. The DC to
find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 +
spell level, or 28 for *explosive runes*.

Eyebite

**Eyebite**

**School**necromancy; **Level**bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one living creature

**Duration**1 round/level

**Saving Throw**: [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]**: yes

Each round, you can target a single living creature, striking it
with waves of power. Depending on the target's HD, this attack
has as many as three effects.

  HD           Effect
  ------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  10 or more   [Sickened]
  5–9          [Panicked], [sickened]
  4 or less    Comatose, [panicked], [sickened]

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

*Sickened*: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body.
A creature affected by this spell remains
[sickened] for 10 minutes per caster
level. The effects cannot be negated by a *[remove
disease]*or
*[heal]*spell, but a *[remove
curse]*is effective.

*Panicked*: The subject becomes
[panicked] for 1d4 rounds. Even after
the panic ends, the creature remains
[shaken] for 10 minutes per caster
level, and it automatically becomes
[panicked] again if it comes within
sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

*Comatose*: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10
minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened
by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a
*[sleep]*effect, and thus elves are not immune
to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to
target a foe.
