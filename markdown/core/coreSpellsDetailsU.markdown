**Target** one creature or object

**Duration** 24 hours

Unhallow

**Unhallow**

**School** evocation [evil]; **Level** cleric 5, druid 5

**Casting Time** 24 hours

**Components** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least
1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be tied to the
*unhallowed*area)

**Range** touch

**Area** 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** see text

*Unhallow*makes a particular site, building, or structure an
unholy site. This has three major effects.

First, the site or structure is guarded by a *[magic circle
against
good]*effect.

Second, the DC to resist negative channeled energy within the
spell's area of effect gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to
resist positive energy is reduced by 4. [Spell
resistance] does not apply to
this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version
of the spell.

Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the
*unhallowed*site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions
throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and
area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to
all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or
creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end
of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or
replaced simply by casting *unhallow*again.

Spell effects that may be tied to an *unhallowed*site include
*[aid], [bane],
[bless], [cause
fear],
[darkness],
[daylight], [death
ward], [deeper
darkness], [detect
magic], [detect
good], [dimensional
anchor], [discern
lies], [dispel
magic], [endure
elements], [freedom of
movement],
[invisibility purge],
[protection from
energy],
[remove fear],
[resist energy],
[silence],
[tongues],*and *[zone of
truth]*.

Saving throws and [spell
resistance] might apply to
these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for
details.)

An area can receive only one *unhallow*spell (and its associated
spell effect) at a time.

*Unhallow*counters but does not dispel
*[hallow]*.

Unholy Aura

**Unholy Aura**

**School** abjuration [evil]; **Level** cleric 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

**Range** 20 ft.

**Targets** one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered
on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them
from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good
creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the
subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to
[AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on
saves. Unlike the effect of *[protection from
good]*, this
benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by
good creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and
spells cast by good creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and
mental influence, just as *[protection from
good]*does.

Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a
warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of
[Strength] damage
([Fortitude] negates).

Unholy Blight

**Unholy Blight**

**School** evocation [evil]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** instantaneous (1d4 rounds); see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] partial; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes
the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good
and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels
(maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level,
maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be
[sickened] for 1d4 rounds. A
successful [Will] save reduces damage to
half and negates the [sickened]
effect. The effects cannot be negated by *[remove
disease]*or
*[heal],*but *[remove
curse]*is effective.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither
evil nor good, and they are not
[sickened]. Such a creature can
reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a
successful [Will] save.

Unseen Servant

**Unseen Servant**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

An *unseen servant*is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force
that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch
things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and
mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it
repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as
long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors,
drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective
[Strength] score of 2 (so it
can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and
such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not
enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It
can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC
higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't
be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim
(though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.

The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an
attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6
points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against
attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range
(measured from your current position), the servant ceases to
exist.
