**Dancing Lights**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** Up to four lights, all within a 10-ft.-radius area

**Duration** 1 minute (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights
that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of
light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like
will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape.
The *dancing lights*must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in
relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no
concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or
turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet
per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it
exceeds the spell's range.

You can only have one *dancing lights* spell active at any one
time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in
effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell
permanent, it does not count against this limit.

*Dancing lights*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Darkness

**Darkness**

**School**evocation [darkness]; **Level**bard 2, cleric 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, M/DF (bat fur and a piece of coal)

**Range**touch

**Target**object touched

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot
radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area
to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal
light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has
no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light
vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light.
All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light.
All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in
darkness. Creatures with
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) can see in an area of
dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of
light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light
level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase
the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level
than*darkness*.

If *darkness* is cast on a small object that is then placed
inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is
blocked until the covering is removed.

This spell does not stack with itself. *Darkness* can be used to
counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

Darkvision

**Darkvision**

**School** transmutation; **Level** ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an
agate)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total
darkness. [Darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) is black and
white only but otherwise like normal sight.

*Darkvision*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Daylight

**Daylight**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** bard 3, cleric 3, druid
3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object
to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination
increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step
(darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and
normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties
in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this
magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent
of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or
destroyed by such light.

If *daylight*is cast on a small object that is then placed inside
or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked
until the covering is removed.

*Daylight*brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice
versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing
light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

*Daylight*counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or
lower level, such as *darkness.*

Daze

**Daze**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of wool or similar substance)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one humanoid creature of 4 HD or less

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer
Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD
are not affected. A [dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed) subject is
not [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned), so attackers get no
special advantage against it. After a creature has been
[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed) by this spell, it is immune to
the effects of this spell for 1 minute.

Daze Monster

**Daze Monster**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target**one living creature of 6 HD or less

This spell functions like *[daze](daze.html#_daze),*but it can
affect any one living creature of any type. Creatures of 7 or
more HD are not affected.

Death Knell

**Death Knell**

**School** necromancy [death, evil]; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous/10 minutes per HD of subject; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to
fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living
creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails
its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points
and a +2 enhancement bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength). Additionally, your
effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects
dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster
level does not grant you access to more spells. These effects
last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.

Death Ward

**Death Ward**

**School**necromancy; **Level**cleric 4, druid 5, paladin 4

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, DF

**Range**touch

**Target**living creature touched

**Duration**1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death
spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save
to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The
subject is immune to [energy
drain](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) and
any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.

This spell does not remove [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) that
the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties
from [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) for
the duration of its effect.

*Death ward*does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even
if those attacks might be lethal.

Deathwatch

**Deathwatch**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Using the powers of necromancy, you can determine the condition
of creatures near death within the spell's range. You instantly
know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile
(alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting
off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), healthy, undead, or
neither alive nor dead (such as a construct). *Deathwatch*sees
through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign
death.

Deeper Darkness

**Deeper Darkness**

**School**evocation [darkness]; **Level**cleric 3

**Duration**10 min./level (D)

This spell functions as *[darkness](darkness.html#_darkness)*,
except that objects radiate darkness in a 60-foot radius and the
light level is lowered by two steps. Bright light becomes dim
light and normal light becomes darkness. Areas of dim light and
darkness become supernaturally dark. This functions like
darkness, but even creatures with
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) cannot see within the
spell's confines.

This spell does not stack with itself. *Deeper darkness* can be
used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell
level.

Deep Slumber

**Deep Slumber**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

This spell functions like *[sleep](sleep.html#_sleep),*except
that it affects 10 HD of targets.

Delayed Blast Fireball

**Delayed Blast Fireball**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Duration** 5 rounds or less; see text

This spell functions like
*[fireball](fireball.html#_fireball),*except that it is more
powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast.
The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
level (maximum 20d6). The glowing bead created by *delayed blast
fireball*can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can
choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the
amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot
change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead. If
you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination
until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a
thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles
and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a
25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

Delay Poison

**Delay Poison**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 2, cleric 2,
druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in
its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the
spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's
duration has expired. *Delay poison*does not cure any damage that
poison may have already done.

Demand

**Demand**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell functions like *[sending](sending.html#_sending),*but
the message can also contain a
*[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*(see the
*[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*spell), which the
subject does its best to carry out. A successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save negates the
*[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*effect but not the
contact itself. The *demand,*if received, is understood even if
the subject's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score is as
low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according
to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the
*demand*is issued, the message is understood but the
*[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion)*is ineffective.

The *demand*'s message to the creature must be 25 words or less,
including the *[suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion).*The
creature can also give a short reply immediately.

Desecrate

**Desecrate**

**School** evocation [evil]; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component** V, S, M (a vial of unholy water and 25 gp worth (5
pounds) of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the
area), DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 2 hours/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell imbues an area with negative energy. The DC to resist
negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane
bonus. Every undead creature entering a *desecrated*area gains a
+1 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving
throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such
an area gains +1 hit points per HD.

If the *desecrated*area contains an altar, shrine, or other
permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher
power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 profane bonus to
negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points
per HD for undead created in the area).

Furthermore, anyone who casts *[animate
dead](animateDead.html#_animate-dead)*within this area may create
as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per
caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).

If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture
of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the
*desecrate*spell instead curses the area, cutting off its
connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary
function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties
relating to undead, as given above.

*Desecrate*counters and dispels
*[consecrate](consecrate.html#_consecrate)*.

Destruction

**Destruction**

**School**necromancy [death]; **Level** cleric 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (holy or unholy symbol costing 500 gp)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster
level. If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains
utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or
possessions). If the target's
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) saving throw succeeds, it
instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore life
to a character who has failed to save against this spell (and was
slain) is to use *[true
resurrection](trueResurrection.html#_true-resurrection)*, a
carefully worded *[wish](wish.html#_wish)* spell followed by
*[resurrection](resurrection.html#_resurrection)*, or
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*.

Detect Animals or Plants

**Detect Animals or Plants**

**School** divination; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone
emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must
think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you
can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of
information revealed depends on how long you search a particular
area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant
in the area.

*2nd Round*: Number of individuals of the specified kind in the
area and the condition of the healthiest specimen.

*3rd Round*: The condition (see below) and location of each
individual present. If an animal or a plant is outside your line
of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact
location.

*Conditions*: For purposes of this spell, the categories of
condition are as follows:

Normal: Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of
disease.

Fair: 30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining.

Poor: Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining,
afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating
injury.

Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease
that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or crippled.

If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell
indicates the weaker of the two.

Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a
new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone,
1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt blocks it.

Detect Chaos

**Detect Chaos**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 1

This spell functions like *[detect
evil](detectEvil.html#_detect-evil)*, except that it detects the
auras of chaotic creatures, clerics of chaotic deities, chaotic
spells, and chaotic magic items, and you are vulnerable to an
overwhelming chaotic aura if you are lawful.

Detect Evil

**Detect Evil**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Component** V, S, DF

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 10 min./ level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information
revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or
subject.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of evil.

*2nd Round*: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells)
in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present.

If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power
is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's
source is at least twice your character level, you are
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round and the spell
ends.

*3rd Round*: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is
outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but
not its exact location.

*Aura Power*: An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil
creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster
level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the table
below. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the
spell indicates the stronger of the two.

*Lingering Aura*: An evil aura lingers after its original source
dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case
of a creature or magic item). If *[detect evil](#detect-evil)*is
cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura
strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the
aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

  Original Strength   Duration of Lingering Aura
  ------------------- ----------------------------
  Faint               1d6 rounds
  Moderate            1d6 minutes
  Strong              1d6 × 10 minutes
  Overwhelming        1d6 days

Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil,
and as such this spell does not detect them. Creatures with
actively evil intents count as evil creatures for the purpose of
this spell.

Each round, you can turn to [detect evil](#detect-evil) in a new
area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1
inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or
dirt blocks it.

Detect Good

**Detect Good**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 1

This spell functions like *[detect
evil](detectEvil.html#_detect-evil)*, except that it detects the
auras of good creatures, clerics or paladins of good deities,
good spells, and good magic items, and you are vulnerable to an
overwhelming good aura if you are evil.

Detect Law

**Detect Law**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 1

This spell functions like *[detect
evil](detectEvil.html#_detect-evil)*, except that it detects the
auras of lawful creatures, clerics of lawful deities, lawful
spells, and lawful magic items, and you are vulnerable to an
overwhelming lawful aura if you are chaotic.

Detect Magic

**Detect Magic**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component**: V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed
depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of magical auras.

*2nd Round*: Number of different magical auras and the power of
the most potent aura.

*3rd Round*: The strength and location of each aura. If the items
or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make
Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic
involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level,
or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura
eminates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its
properties (see Spellcraft).

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical
emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

*Aura Strength*: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning
spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying
table. If an aura falls into more than one category, *detect
magic*indicates the stronger of the two.

*Lingering Aura*: A magical aura lingers after its original
source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in
the case of a magic item). If *detect magic*is cast and directed
at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim
(even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at
this dim level depends on its original power:

  Original Strength   Duration of Lingering Aura
  ------------------- ----------------------------
  Faint               1d6 rounds
  Moderate            1d6 minutes
  Strong              1d6 × 10 minutes
  Overwhelming        1d6 days

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if
they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round,
you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal,
a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

*Detect magic*can be made permanent with a

Detect Poison

**Detect Poison**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target or Area** one creature, one object, or a 5-ft. cube

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been
poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of
poison with a DC 20 [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)
check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20
Craft (alchemy) check if the
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) check fails, or may try
the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) check. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal,
a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Scrying

**Detect Scrying**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of mirror and a miniature brass
hearing trumpet)

**Range** 40 ft.

**Area** 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 24 hours

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by
means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area
radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of
every magical sensor within the spell's area.

If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know
its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make
opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at
least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the
scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from
you.

Detect Secret Doors

**Detect Secret Doors**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth.
Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically
constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The
amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a
particular area or subject.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of secret doors.

*2nd Round*: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If
an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its
direction but not its exact location.

*Each Additional Round*: The mechanism or trigger for one
particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you
can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal,
a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Snares and Pits

**Detect Snares and Pits**

**School** divination; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as
mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does
not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

*Detect snares and pits*does detect certain natural
hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls
of natural rock (a deadfall). It does not reveal other
potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not [detect
magic](detectMagic.html#_detect-magic) traps (except those that
operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell
*[snare](snare.html#_snare)*), nor mechanically complex ones, nor
those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study
a particular area.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of hazards.

*2nd Round*: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a
hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its
direction but not its exact location.

*Each Additional Round*: The general type and trigger for one
particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to examine a new area. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal,
a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Thoughts

**Detect Thoughts**

**School** divination [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a copper piece)

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed
depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious
creatures with
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) scores of 1
or higher).

*2nd Round*: Number of thinking minds and the
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score of
each. If the highest
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) is 26 or
higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score), you
are [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round and the
spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of
the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts
you are detecting.

*3rd Round*: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save prevents you from reading its
thoughts, and you must cast *detect thoughts*again to have
another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence
([Int](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) 1 or 2) have simple,
instinctual thoughts.

Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The
spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt
blocks it.

Detect Undead

**Detect Undead**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (earth from a grave)

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped emanation

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 minute/ level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The
amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a
particular area.

*1st Round*: Presence or absence of undead auras.

*2nd Round*: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength
of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good
alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is
overwhelming (see below), and the creature has HD of at least
twice your character level, you are
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round and the spell
ends.

*3rd Round*: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an
aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its
direction but not its exact location.

*Aura Strength*: The strength of an undead aura is determined by
the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below.

*Lingering Aura*: An undead aura lingers after its original
source is destroyed. If *detect undead*is cast and directed at
such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim
(even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at
this dim level depends on its original power, as given on the
table below.

  HD             Strength       Lingering Aura Duration
  -------------- -------------- -------------------------
  1 or lower     Faint          1d6 rounds
  2–4            Moderate       1d6 minutes
  5–10           Strong         1d6 × 10 minutes
  11 or higher   Overwhelming   1d6 days

Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area. The
spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt
blocks it.

Dictum

**Dictum**

**School** evocation [lawful, sonic]; **Level** cleric 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** 40 ft.

**Area** nonlawful creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered
on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Any nonlawful creature within the area of a *dictum*spell suffers
the following ill effects.

  HD                       Effect
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Equal to caster level    [Deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –1    [Staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –5    [Paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed), [staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –10   Killed, [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed), [staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save reduces or eliminates these
effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one
save and apply the result to all the effects.

*Deafened*: The creature is
[deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened) for 1d4 rounds. Save
negates.

*Staggered*: The creature is
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) for 2d4 rounds. Save
reduces the [staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) effect to
1d4 rounds.

*[Paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed)*: The creature is
[paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) and
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) for 1d10 minutes. Save
reduces the [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) effect to 1
round.

*Killed*: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.
Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead
takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are
instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so
banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes
place regardless of whether the creatures hear the *dictum*or
not*.*The banishment effect allows a [Will](../combat.html#_will)
save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected
by *dictum.*

Dimensional Anchor

**Dimensional Anchor**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (object)

A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch
attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the
ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely
blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a
*dimensional anchor*include *[astral
projection](astralProjection.html#_astral-projection), blink,
[dimension door](dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door), [ethereal
jaunt](etherealJaunt.html#_ethereal-jaunt),
[etherealness](etherealness.html#_etherealness),
[gate](gate.html#_gate), [maze](maze.html#_maze), [plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift), [shadow
walk](shadowWalk.html#_shadow-walk),
[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport),*and similar spell-like
abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a *gate*or
*[teleportation
circle](teleportationCircle.html#_teleportation-circle)*for the
duration of the spell.

A *dimensional anchor*does not interfere with the movement of
creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is
cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack
forms. Also, *dimensional anchor*does not prevent summoned
creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Dimensional Lock

**Dimensional Lock**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks
extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred include
*[astral projection](astralProjection.html#_astral-projection),
blink, [dimension door](dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door),
[ethereal jaunt](etherealJaunt.html#_ethereal-jaunt),
[etherealness](etherealness.html#_etherealness),
[gate](gate.html#_gate), [maze](maze.html#_maze), [plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift), [shadow
walk](shadowWalk.html#_shadow-walk),
[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport),*and similar spell-like
abilities. Once *dimensional lock*is in place, extradimensional
travel into or out of the area is not possible.

A *dimensional lock*does not interfere with the movement of
creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is
cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack
forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from
disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Dimension Door

**Dimension Door**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** you and touched objects or other touched willing
creatures

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none and [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates
(object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no and yes
(object)

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any
other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot
desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating
direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other
actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long
as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also
bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying
gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per
three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium
creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so
forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with
one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in
contact with you.

If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid
body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of
damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable
surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature
traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and
are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no
free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling
with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell
simply fails.

Diminish Plants

**Diminish Plants**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** see text

**Target or Area** see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell has two versions.

*Prune Growth*: This version of the spell causes normal
vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to
shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and
less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been
carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of *diminish plants*
automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants,
such as *[entangle](entangle.html#_entangle), [plant
growth](plantGrowth.html#_plant-growth),*and *[wall of
thorns](wallOfThorns.html#_wall-of-thorns)*.

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a
150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle.
You may also designate portions of the area that are not
affected.

*Stunt Growth*: This version of the spell targets all normal
plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential
productivity over the course of the following year to half
normal.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

Discern Lies

**Discern Lies**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 4, paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Each round, you concentrate on one target, who must be within
range. You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a
lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The
spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional
inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions.

Each round, you may concentrate on a different target.

Discern Location

**Discern Location**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** unlimited

**Target** one creature or object

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

A *discern location*spell is among the most powerful means of
locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a *[mind
blank](mindBlank.html#_mind-blank)*spell or the direct
intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact
location of a single individual or object. *Discern
location*circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or
location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's
location (place, name, business name, building name, or the
like), community, county (or similar political division),
country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target
lies.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the
creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an
object, you must have touched it at least once.

Disguise Self

**Disguise Self**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

You make yourself—including clothing, armor, weapons, and
equipment—look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller,
thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type
(although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the
extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or
obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person
or gender.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the
chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or
audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use
this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the
Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save to recognize it as an illusion.

Disintegrate

**Disintegrate**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial
(object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must
make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck
by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a
maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a
trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is
unaffected.

When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much
as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell
disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure
targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of
force, such as *[forceful
hand](forcefulHand.html#_forceful-hand)*or a *[wall of
force](wallOfForce.html#_wall-of-force)*, but not magical effects
such as a *[globe of
invulnerability](globeOfInvulnerability.html#_globe-of-invulnerability)*or
an *[antimagic field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field).*

A creature or object that makes a successful
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save is partially
affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage
reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is
entirely disintegrated.

Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that
is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

Dismissal

**Dismissal**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one extraplanar creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper
plane if it fails a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save. If the
spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but
there is a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane
other than its own.

Dispel Chaos

**Dispel Chaos**

**School** abjuration [lawful]; **Level** cleric 5, paladin 4

This spell functions like *[dispel
evil](dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)*, except that you are
surrounded by constant, blue lawful energy, and the spell affects
chaotic creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Evil

**Dispel Evil**

**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** cleric 5, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target or Targets** you and a touched evil creature from
another plane, or you and an enchantment or evil spell on a
touched creature or object

**Duration** 1 round/level or until discharged, whichever comes
first

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** see text

Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has
three effects.

First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks by evil
creatures.

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil
creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that
creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the
effects with a successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save
([spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applies).
This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one
enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell.
Spells that can't be dispelled by *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*also can't be dispelled by
*dispel evil*. Saving throws and [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) do not apply to
this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.

Dispel Good

**Dispel Good**

**School** abjuration [evil]; **Level** cleric 5

This spell functions like *[dispel
evil](dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)*, except that you are
surrounded by dark, wavering unholy energy, and the spell affects
good creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Law

**Dispel Law**

**School** abjuration [chaotic]; **Level** cleric 5

This spell functions like *[dispel
evil](dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)*, except that you are
surrounded by flickering, yellow chaotic energy, and the spell
affects lawful creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Magic

**Dispel Magic**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4,
paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target or Area** one spellcaster, creature, or object

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You can use *dispel magic*to end one ongoing spell that has been
cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical
abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's
spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired.
Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated
by *dispel magic*. *Dispel magic*can dispel (but not counter)
spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell
with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the
magical effect is already over before the *dispel magic*can take
effect.

You choose to use *dispel magic*in one of two ways: a targeted
dispel or a counterspell.

*Targeted Dispel*: One object, creature, or spell is the target
of the *dispel magic*spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 +
your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest
caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful,
that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell
with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you
have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed
to dispel every spell.

For example, a 7th-level caster casts *dispel magic*, targeting a
creature affected by
*[stoneskin](stoneskin.html#_stoneskin)*(caster level 12th) and
*fly* (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19.
This check is not high enough to end the
*[stoneskin](stoneskin.html#_stoneskin)* (which would have
required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the *fly*
(which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23
or higher, the *[stoneskin](stoneskin.html#_stoneskin)* would
have been dispelled, leaving the *fly*intact. Had the dispel
check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.

You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell
affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a
*[wall of fire](wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire)*). You must name
the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your
caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that
spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are
dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted
effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an
ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by *summon monster*),
you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object
or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel
check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's
caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties
are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its
magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the
duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a
*bag of holding*) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical
properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a
sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are
unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell
that you cast yourself.

*Counterspell*: When *dispel magic*is used in this way, the spell
targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a
true counterspell, however, *dispel magic*may not work; you must
make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

**Dispel Magic, Greater**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 5, cleric 6, druid 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Target or Area** one spellcaster, creature, or object; or a
20-ft.-radius burst

This spell functions like *[dispel magic](#dispel-magic)*, except
that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be
used to target multiple creatures.

You choose to use *greater dispel magic*in one of three ways: a
targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell:

*Targeted Dispel*: This functions as a targeted *[dispel
magic](#dispel-magic)*, but it can dispel one spell for every
four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level
spells and proceeding to lower level spells.

Additionally, *greater dispel magic*has a chance to dispel any
effect that *[remove curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*can
remove, even if *[dispel magic](#dispel-magic)*can't dispel that
effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.

*Area Dispel*: When *greater dispel magic*is used in this way,
the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll
one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the
area, as if targeted by *[dispel magic](#dispel-magic)*. For each
object within the area that is the target of one or more spells,
apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not
affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is
within the area of the *greater dispel magic*spell, apply the
dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose
area overlaps that of the *greater dispel magic*spell, apply the
dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping
area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell
(such as a monster summoned by *summon monster*) is in the area,
apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object
or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to
attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against
any spell that you have cast.

*Counterspell*: This functions as *[dispel
magic](#dispel-magic),*but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel
check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Displacement

**Displacement**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, M (a small loop of leather)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from
its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance
as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment,
*displacement*does not prevent enemies from targeting the
creature normally. *[True
seeing](trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing)*reveals its true location
and negates the miss chance.

Disrupting Weapon

**Disrupting Weapon**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Targets** one melee weapon

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

This spell makes a melee weapon deadly to undead. Any undead
creature with HD equal to or less than your caster level must
succeed on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save or be destroyed
utterly if struck in combat with this weapon. [Spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) does not apply
against the destruction effect.

Disrupt Undead

**Disrupt Undead**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You direct a ray of positive energy. You must make a ranged touch
attack to hit, and if the ray hits an undead creature, it deals
1d6 points of damage to it.

Divination

**Divination**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (incense and an appropriate offering worth
25 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

Similar to *[augury](augury.html#_augury)*but more powerful, a
*divination*spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice
in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or
activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by
the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take
the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on
the information, the conditions may change so that the
information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct
*divination*is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If
the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific
magic yielding false information is at work.

As with *[augury](augury.html#_augury)*, multiple
*divinations*about the same topic by the same caster use the same
dice result as the first *divination*spell and yield the same
answer each time.

Divine Favor

**Divine Favor**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute

Calling upon the strength and wisdom of a deity, you gain a +1

doesn't apply to spell damage.

Divine Power

**Divine Power**

**School** evocation; **Level**cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

Calling upon the divine power of your patron, you imbue yourself
with strength and skill in combat. You gain a +1 luck bonus on
attack rolls, weapon damage rolls,
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) checks, and
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)-based skill checks
for every three caster levels you have (maximum +6). You also
gain 1 temporary hit point per caster level. Whenever you make a
full-attack action, you can make an additional attack at your
full base attack bonus, plus any appropriate modifiers. This
additional attack is not cumulative with similar effects, such as
*[haste](haste.html#_haste)* or weapons with the *speed* special
ability.

Dominate Animal

**Dominate Animal**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
druid 3

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one animal

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell allows you to enchant the targeted animal and direct
it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.”
Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to
attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the
dominated animal) are simply ignored.

*Dominate animal*establishes a mental link between you and the
subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental
command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the
creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input
from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because
you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may
be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own
comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on
controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do
something it normally couldn't do. Changing your instructions or
giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of
redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

Dominate Monster

**Dominate Monster**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Target** one creature

This spell functions like *[dominate
person](dominatePerson.html#_dominate-person),*except that the
spell is not restricted by creature type.

Dominate Person

**Dominate Person**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one humanoid

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a
telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally
force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of
its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate
only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,”
and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but
you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it
communicate with you telepathically.

Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues
to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all
other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival
(such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited
range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather
than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being
influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill
description).

Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command
is a move action.

By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can
receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the
subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't
actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as
being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's
going on.

Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take
actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2
bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out.
Once control is established, the range at which it can be
exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the
same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.

If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell
each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off
the domination.

*[Protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*or a similar
spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the
telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an
effect does not automatically dispel it.

Doom

**Doom**

**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell fills a single subject with a feeling of horrible
dread that causes it to become
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken).

Dream

**Dream**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard
5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S

**Range** unlimited

**Target** one living creature touched

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the
form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the
recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no
doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears
in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The
message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it
perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The
recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the
messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the
recipient.

Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns
instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time
required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and
deliver the message.

If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger
can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance.
The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes
to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the
message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the
trance comes awake, ending the spell.

Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by
this spell.

The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the
activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both
physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while
in the trance.
