C = Class Skill; \* Armor check penalty applies

Skill descriptions adhere to the following guidelines.

**Skill Name**: The skill name line includes (in addition to the
name of the skill) the following information.

*Key Ability*: The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier
applies to the skill check.

*Trained Only*: If this notation is included in the skill name
line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If
this notation is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a
rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained
use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).

*Armor Check Penalty*: If this notation is included in the skill
name line, an armor check penalty applies (see [Equipment]) to
checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check
penalty does not apply.

**Description**: The skill name line is followed by a general
description of what using the skill represents.

**Check**: What a character (“you” in the skill description) can
do with a successful skill check and the check's Difficulty Class
(DC).

**Action**: The type of action using the skill requires, or the
amount of time required for a check.

**Try Again**: Any conditions that apply to successive attempts
to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to
attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an
inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take
20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried
without any inherent penalty other than the additional time
required.

**Special**: Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as
special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain
characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.

**Restriction**: The full utility of certain skills is restricted
to characters of certain classes. This entry indicates whether
any such restrictions exist for the skill.

**Untrained**: This entry indicates what a character without at
least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't
appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained
characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained
character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that
are designated “Trained Only”).
