**Hallow**

**School** evocation [good]; **Level** cleric 5, druid 5

**Casting Time** 24 hours

**Components** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least
1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in
the *hallowed*area), DF

**Range** touch

**Area** 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** see text

*Hallow*makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy
site. This has four major effects.

First, the site is warded by a *[magic circle against
evil](magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil)*effect.

Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this
area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy
is reduced by 4. [Spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) does not apply to
this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version
of the spell.

Third, any dead body interred in a *hallowed*site cannot be
turned into an undead creature.

Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the *hallowed*site.
The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the
entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or
effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all
creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or
creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of
the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or
replaced simply by casting *hallow*again.

Spell effects that may be tied to a *hallowed*site include
*[aid](aid.html#_aid), [bane](bane.html#_bane),
[bless](bless.html#_bless), [cause
fear](/PFRPG/prd/spells/causeFear.html#_cause-fear),

[spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) might
apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell
descriptions for details.)

An area can receive only one *hallow*spell (and its associated
spell effect) at a time. *Hallow*counters but does not dispel
*[unhallow](unhallow.html#_unhallow)*.

Hallucinatory Terrain

**Hallucinatory Terrain**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a green leaf)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** one 30-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** 2 hours/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief (if
interacted with); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other
sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures
within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

Halt Undead

**Halt Undead**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (see text);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A
nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an
intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it
renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the
spell (similar to the effect of *[hold
person](holdPerson.html#_hold-person)*on a living creature). The
effect is broken if the *halted*creatures are attacked or take
damage.

Harm

**Harm**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) half; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Harm*charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points
of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th
level). If the creature successfully saves, *harm*deals half this
amount. *Harm* cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than
1.

If used on an undead creature, *harm*acts like
*[heal](heal.html#_heal)*.

Haste

**Haste**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal.
This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one
extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack
is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any
modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not
cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a
*speed* weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so
you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an
extra action in the round.)

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1
[dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saves. Any condition that makes
you lose your [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)
bonus to [Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) (if any) also
makes you lose [dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses)es.

All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land
movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a
maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of
movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it
affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased
speed. Multiple *haste*effects don't stack. *Haste*dispels and
counters *[slow](slow.html#_slow).*

Heal

**Heal**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 6, druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

*Heal*enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to
wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all
of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability
damage, [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded),
[confused](../glossary.html#_confused)*,*[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed),
[dazzled](../glossary.html#_dazzled),
[deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened), diseased,
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted),
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued),
[feeblemind](feeblemind.html#_feeblemind)ed*,*[insanity](insanity.html#_insanity),
[nauseated](../glossary.html#_nauseated), poisoned,
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened), and
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned). It also cures 10 hit points
of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at
15th level.

*Heal*does not remove [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or
restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, *heal*instead acts like
*[harm](harm.html#_harm)*.

**Heal, Mass**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 9

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one or more creatures, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[heal](#heal),*except as noted above.
The maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is
250.

Heal Mount

**Heal Mount**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** paladin 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** your mount touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

This spell functions like *[heal](heal.html#_heal),*but it
affects only the paladin's special mount (typically a horse).

Heat Metal

**Heat Metal**

**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two
of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of
metal/level, all of which must be within a 30-ft. circle

**Duration** 7 rounds

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

*Heat metal*causes metal objects to become red-hot. Unattended,
nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a
saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's
possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own
is higher.

A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes
full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The
creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the
table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and
uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also
occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the
second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes
pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the
metal is searing hot, and causes more damage, as shown on the
table below.

  Round   Metal Temperature   Damage
  ------- ------------------- ------------
  1       Warm                None
  2       Hot                 1d4 points
  3–5     Searing             2d4 points
  6       Hot                 1d4 points
  7       Warm                None

Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire
damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point
basis. If cast underwater, *heat metal*deals half damage and
boils the surrounding water.

*Heat metal*counters and dispels *[chill
metal](chillMetal.html#_chill-metal)*.

Helping Hand

**Helping Hand**

**School** evocation; **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 5 miles

**Effect** ghostly hand

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to
find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that
creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to
follow.

When the spell is cast, you specify a person (or any creature) by
physical description, which can include race, gender, and
appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or
class. When the description is done, the hand streaks off in
search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time
it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as
detailed on the following table.

  Distance          Time to Locate
  ----------------- ----------------
  100 ft. or less   1 round
  1,000 ft.         1 minute
  1 mile            10 minutes
  2 miles           1 hour
  3 miles           2 hours
  4 miles           3 hours
  5 miles           4 hours

Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to
follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your
direction, indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand
hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a
speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the
subject back to you, it disappears.

The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any
particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow,
the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then
disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to
you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own
devices to locate you.

If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the
description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that
creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a
second subject.

If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no
subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns
to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such
creature was found), and disappears.

The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) to anyone except you and
a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any
other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to
you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze
through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than
5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

Heroes' Feast

**Heroes' Feast**

**School**conjuration [creation]; **Level**bard 6, cleric 6

**Casting Time**10 minutes

**Components**V, S, DF

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect**feast for one creature/level

**Duration**1 hour plus 12 hours; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table,
chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to
consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour
is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all
sickness and nausea, receives the benefits of both *[neutralize
poison](neutralizePoison.html#_neutralize-poison)* and *[remove
disease](removeDisease.html#_remove-disease)*, and gains 1d8
temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum
+10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the
feast. The ambrosial food grants each creature that partakes a +1
morale bonus on attack rolls and [Will](../combat.html#_will)
saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and
fear effects for 12 hours.

If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined
and all effects of the spell are negated.

Heroism

**Heroism**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale
in battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls,
saves, and skill checks.

**Heroism, Greater**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Duration** 1 min./level

This spell functions like *[heroism](#heroism),*except the
creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and
skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points
equal to your caster level (maximum 20).

Hide from Animals

**Hide from Animals**

**School** abjuration; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** one creature touched/level

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or
supernatural sensory capabilities, such as
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense),
[blindsight](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense),
[scent](../glossary.html#_scent), and tremorsense, cannot detect
or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the
warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an
animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends
for all recipients.

Hide from Undead

**Hide from Undead**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** one touched creature/level

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this spell.
Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense),
[blindsight](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense),
[scent](../glossary.html#_scent), and tremorsense, cannot detect
or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures (such
as skeletons or zombies) are automatically affected and act as
though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead
creature gets a single [Will](../combat.html#_will) saving throw.
If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures.
If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present,
however, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded
creature attempts to channel positive energy, turn or command
undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even
with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.

Hideous Laughter

**Hideous Laughter**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (tiny fruit tarts and a feather)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It
collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling
[prone](../glossary.html#_prone). The subject can take no actions
while laughing, but is not considered
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless). After the spell ends, it
can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a
new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is
successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues
laughing for the entire duration.

A creature with an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score of 2
or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from
the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because
humor doesn't “translate” well.

Hold Animal

**Hold Animal**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
druid 2, ranger 2

**Components**: V, S

**Target** one animal

This spell functions like *[hold
person](holdPerson.html#_hold-person),*except that it affects an
animal instead of a humanoid.

Hold Monster

**Hold Monster**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Components**: V, S, M/DF (one hard metal bar or rod, which can
be as small as a three-penny nail)

**Target** one living creature

This spell functions like *[hold
person](holdPerson.html#_hold-person),*except that it affects any
living creature that fails its [Will](../combat.html#_will) save.

**Hold Monster, Mass**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Targets** one or more creatures, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[hold
person](holdPerson.html#_hold-person),*except that it affects
multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save.

Hold Person

**Hold Person**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a small, straight piece of iron)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 round/level (D); see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The subject becomes [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) and
freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot
take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the
subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is
a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
A winged creature who is [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed)
cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may
drown.

**Hold Person, Mass**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Targets** one or more humanoid creatures, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[hold person](#hold-person),*except as
noted above.

Hold Portal

**Hold Portal**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component**V

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one portal, up to 20 sq. ft./level

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter
of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if
it were securely closed and normally locked. A
*[knock](knock.html#_knock)*spell or a successful *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell can negate a *hold
portal*spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this
spell.

Holy Aura

**Holy Aura**

**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** cleric 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

**Range** 20 ft.

**Targets** one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered
on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting
them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by
evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) when they strike the
subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and a +4 resistance bonus on
saves. Unlike *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*, this
benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by
evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) 25 against evil
spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and
mental influence, just as *[protection from
evil](protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)*does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a
creature warded by a *holy aura*, the offending attacker is
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded)
([Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save negates, as
*[blindness/deafness](blindnessDeafness.html#_blindness-deafness)*,
but against *holy aura's*save DC).

Holy Smite

**Holy Smite**

**School** evocation [good]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous (1 round); see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and
neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are
unaffected.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels
(maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of
damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and
causes it to become [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) for 1
round. A successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) saving throw
reduces damage to half and negates the
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither
good nor evil, and they are not
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded). Such a creature can reduce
that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a
successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save.

Holy Sword

**Holy Sword**

**School** evocation [good]; **Level** paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target**melee weapon touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or
any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a *+5 holy
weapon*(+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra
2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a *[magic
circle against
evil](magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil)*effect
(as the spell). If the *magic circle*ends, the sword creates a
new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically
canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot
have more than one *holy sword*at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell
supercede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal
enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the
duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with *bless
weapon*or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any
way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's
bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to
attack.

Holy Word

**Holy Word**

**School** evocation [good, sonic]; **Level** cleric 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** 40 ft.

**Area** nongood creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Any nongood creature within the area of a *holy word*spell
suffers the following ill effects.

  HD                       Effect
  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Equal to caster level    [Deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –1    [Blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –5    [Paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed), [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)
  Up to caster level –10   Killed, [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed), [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded), [deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened)

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save reduces or eliminates these
effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one
save and apply the result to all the effects.

*Deafened*: The creature is
[deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened) for 1d4 rounds. Save
negates.

*Blinded*: The creature is [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded)
for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) effect to 1d4 rounds.

*Paralyzed*: The creature is
[paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) and
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) for 1d10 minutes. Save
reduces the [paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) effect to 1
round.

*Killed*: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.
Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead
takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are
instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so
banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes
place regardless of whether the creatures hear the *holy word* or
not*.*The banishment effect allows a [Will](../combat.html#_will)
save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by
*holy word.*

Horrid Wilting

**Horrid Wilting**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a bit of sponge)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Targets** living creatures, no two of which can be more than 60
ft. apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) half;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject
living creature, causing flesh to wither and crack and crumble to
dust. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum
20d6). This spell is especially devastating to water elementals
and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per
caster level (maximum 20d8).

Hypnotic Pattern

**Hypnotic Pattern**

**School** illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V (bard only), S, M (a stick of incense or a
crystal rod); see text

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** colorful lights in a 10-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** Concentration + 2 rounds

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the
air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your
caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of HD of
creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected
first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest
to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are
not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected
creatures become [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated) by
the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell,
but a bard must perform as a verbal component.

Hypnotism

**Hypnotism**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** several living creatures, no two of which may be more
than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 2d4 rounds (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you
can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and
requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD
of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected
before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or
hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to
be [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated).

If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on
its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not
in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of –2.

While the subject is [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated)
by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more
friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of
the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The
request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends,
the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with
respect to that particular request.

A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you
enspelled it.
