@strong{Baleful Polymorph}

@strong{School} transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level} druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target}one creature

@strong{Duration}permanent

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Fortitude] negates, [Will] partial, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: yes

As @emph{[beast shape III],}except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.

If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a [Will] save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma] scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled when a target fails to resist the effects of @emph{baleful polymorph}, and as long as @emph{baleful polymorph} remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. [Incorporeal] or gaseous creatures are immune to @emph{baleful polymorph}, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

Bane

@strong{Bane}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Area} 50-ft.-radius burst, centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Bane}fills your enemies with fear and doubt. Each affected creature takes a --1 penalty on attack rolls and a --1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. @emph{Bane}counters and dispels @emph{[bless]}.

Banishment

@strong{Banishment}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (see text)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{banishment}spell is a more powerful version of the @emph{[dismissal]}spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.

You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's [spell resistance] (if any), and the saving throw DC increases by 2.

Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against [spell resistance] and increasing the save DC by 4).

Barkskin

@strong{Barkskin}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 2, ranger 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Barkskin}toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.

The enhancement bonus provided by @emph{barkskin}stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

Bear's Endurance

@strong{Bear's Endurance}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bear)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to [Constitution], which adds the usual benefits to hit points, [Fortitude] saves, [Constitution] checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in [Constitution] score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's [Constitution] drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

Bestow Curse

@strong{Bestow Curse}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following.

@itemize
@item
--6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).
@item
--4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks.
@item
Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.
@end itemize

You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a @emph{[break enchantment]}, @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[miracle]}, @emph{[remove curse]}, or @emph{[wish]}spell.

@emph{Bestow curse}counters @emph{[remove curse]}.

Binding

@strong{Binding}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (opals worth 500 gp per HD of the target creature, plus other components as specified below)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} see text (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{binding}spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.

You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts @emph{[suggestion]}, your caster level for this casting of @emph{binding}increases by 1. For each assistant who casts @emph{[dominate animal], [dominate person],}or @emph{[dominate monster],}your caster level for this casting of @emph{binding}increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a @emph{binding}spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the @emph{binding}spell, saving throws and [spell resistance] against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial [Will] saving throw and how long the @emph{binding}lasts. All @emph{binding}spells are dismissible.

Regardless of the version of @emph{binding}you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.

If you cast any of the first three versions of @emph{binding}(those with limited durations), you may cast additional @emph{binding}spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all @emph{binding}spells it has received are broken.

The @emph{binding}spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.

@emph{Chaining}: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an @emph{[antipathy]}spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of @emph{binding}is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.

@emph{Slumber}: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of @emph{binding}is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a [sleep] effect.

@emph{Bound Slumber}: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a [sleep] effect.

@emph{Hedged Prison}: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.

@emph{Metamorphosis}: The subject assumes [gaseous form], except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The @emph{binding}is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.

@emph{Minimus Containment}: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The @emph{binding}is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.

You can't dispel a @emph{binding}spell with @emph{[dispel magic]}or a similar effect, though an @emph{[antimagic field]}or @emph{[mage's disjunction]}affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by @emph{[dismissal], banishment,}or a similar effect.

Black Tentacles

@strong{Black Tentacles}

@strong{School}conjuration (creation); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (octopus or squid tentacle)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area}20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration}1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}: none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: no

This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear, burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area.

Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that @emph{black tentacles} is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles' [CMB], the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their [Strength] and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.

If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the [grappled] condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The @emph{black tentacles} spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that @emph{black tentacles} succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The [CMD] of @emph{black tentacles}, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its [CMB].

The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.

Blade Barrier

@strong{Blade Barrier}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} cleric 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form is 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half or [Reflex] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a [Reflex] save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful [Reflex] save.

A @emph{blade barrier}provides cover (+4 bonus to [AC], +2 bonus on [Reflex] saves) against attacks made through it.

Blasphemy

@strong{Blasphemy}

@strong{School}evocation [evil, sonic]; @strong{Level}cleric 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range}40 ft.

@strong{Area}nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any nonevil creature within the area of a @emph{blasphemy}spell suffers the following ill effects.

@multitable {Up to caster level --10} {Killed, paralyzed, weakened, [dazed]} 
@headitem 
HD
 @tab Effect
@item 
Equal to caster level
 @tab [Dazed]
@item 
Up to caster level --1
 @tab Weakened, [dazed]
@item 
Up to caster level --5
 @tab [Paralyzed], weakened, [dazed]
@item 
Up to caster level --10
 @tab Killed, paralyzed, weakened, [dazed]
@end multitable

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

@emph{Dazed}: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally. Save negates.

@emph{Weakened}: The creature's [Strength] score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Save for half.

@emph{[Paralyzed]}: The creature is paralyzed and [helpless] for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the [paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

@emph{Killed}: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the @emph{blasphemy} or not@emph{.}The banishment effect allows a [Will] save (at a --4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by @emph{blasphemy.}

Bleed

@strong{Bleed}

@strong{School}necromancy; @strong{Level}cleric 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: yes

You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but stabilized to resume [dying]. Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has --1 or fewer hit points. That creature begins dying, taking 1 point of damage per round. The creature can be stabilized later normally. This spell causes a creature that is dying to take 1 point of damage.

Bless

@strong{Bless}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 50 ft.

@strong{Area} The caster and all allies within a 50-ft. burst, centered on the caster

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Bless}fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects.

@emph{Bless}counters and dispels @emph{[bane]}.

Bless Water

@strong{Bless Water}

@strong{School} transmutation [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (5 pounds of powdered silver worth 25 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} flask of water touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with positive energy, turning it into [holy water].

Bless Weapon

@strong{Bless Weapon}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}weapon touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the [DR] of evil creatures or striking evil [incorporeal] creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the [DR] of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.

In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect related to critical hits, such as a @emph{keen} weapon or a @emph{vorpal sword}.

Blight

@strong{Blight}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} plant touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may attempt a [Fortitude] saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.

This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.

Blindness/Deafness

@strong{Blindness/Deafness}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} permanent (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You call upon the powers of unlife to render the subject [blinded] or [deafened], as you choose.

Blink

@strong{Blink}

@strong{School}transmutation; @strong{Level}bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 round/level (D)

You “blink” quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. @emph{Blink}has several effects, as follows.

Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely [invisible]. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).

If the attacker can see [invisible] creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.

Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target [invisible], ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).

While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered [invisible] and targets retain their [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see [invisible] creatures.

You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.

While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.

Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.

An ethereal creature is [invisible], [incorporeal], and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an [incorporeal] creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.

An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

Blur

@strong{Blur}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A @emph{[see invisibility]}spell does not counteract the @emph{blur}effect, but a @emph{[true seeing]}spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

Break Enchantment

@strong{Break Enchantment}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 4, cleric 5, paladin 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. @emph{Break enchantment}can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by @emph{[dispel magic]} or @emph{stone to flesh}, @emph{break enchantment}works only if that spell is 5th level or lower.

If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, @emph{break enchantment}does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects.

Breath of Life

@strong{Breath of Life}

@strong{School}conjuration (healing); @strong{Level}cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}creature touched

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (harmless) or [Will] half, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless) or yes, see text

This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

Unlike other spells that heal damage, @emph{breath of life} can bring recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less than its [Constitution] score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to or greater than its [Constitution] score, the creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through @emph{breath of life} gain a temporary [negative level]that lasts for 1 day.

Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by @emph{breath of life}.

Like cure spells, @emph{breath of life} deals damage to undead creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

Bull's Strength

@strong{Bull's Strength}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bull)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Strength], adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the [Strength] modifier.

@strong{Bull's Strength, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[bull's strength]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Burning Hands

@strong{Burning Hands}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 15 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.

@strong{Telekinesis}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Target or Targets} see text

@strong{Duration} concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object) or none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object); see text

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.

@emph{Sustained Force}: A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful [Will] save or with [spell resistance].

This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 [Intelligence] checks.

@emph{Combat Maneuver}: Alternatively, once per round, you can use @emph{[telekinesis]}to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your [Combat Maneuver Bonus], and you add your [Intelligence] modifier (if a wizard) or [Charisma] modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your [Strength] or [Dexterity] modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but [spell resistance] applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.

@emph{Violent Thrust}: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).

You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your [Intelligence] modifier (if a wizard) or [Charisma] modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no [Strength] bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed [Will] saves ) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.

If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

Telekinetic Sphere

@strong{Telekinetic Sphere}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a crystal sphere and a pair of small magnets)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or objects

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell functions like @emph{[resilient sphere],}but the creatures or objects caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly weightless. Anything contained within a @emph{telekinetic sphere}weighs only one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating its contents.

You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by concentrating on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a level surface. You can resume concentrating on your next turn or any later turn during the spell's duration.

The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.

You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

Telepathic Bond

@strong{Telepathic Bond}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (two eggshells from two different creatures)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} you plus one willing creature per three levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an [Intelligence] score of 3 or higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

@emph{Telepathic bond}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell, though it only bonds two creatures per casting of @emph{[permanency]}.

Teleportation Circle

@strong{Teleportation Circle}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, M (amber dust to cover circle worth 1,000 gp)

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as @emph{[greater teleport],}any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.

@emph{Teleportation circle}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent @emph{teleportation circle}that is disabled becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

Magic traps such as @emph{teleportation circle}are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of @emph{teleportation circle}.

Teleport

@strong{Teleport}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} personal and touch

@strong{Target} you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none and [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no and yes (object)

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is [spell resistance] applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and [spell resistance].

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

@emph{Familiarity}: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've been there often. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as @emph{[scrying]}.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

@emph{On Target}: You appear where you want to be.

@emph{Off Target}: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.

@emph{Similar Area}: You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.

@emph{Mishap}: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

@strong{Teleport, Greater}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions like @emph{[teleport],}except that there is no range limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.

Teleport Object

@strong{Teleport Object}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu. ft./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell functions like @emph{[teleport],}except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted @emph{[dispel magic]}spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

Temporal Stasis

@strong{Temporal Stasis}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth 5,000 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow, and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it. This state persists until the magic is removed (such as by a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}spell or a @emph{[freedom]}spell).

Time Stop

@strong{Time Stop}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text

This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the @emph{time stop}is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration of the @emph{time stop} have their normal effects on other creatures once the @emph{time stop}ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.

You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in another creature's possession.

You are undetectable while @emph{time stop}lasts. You cannot enter an area protected by an @emph{[antimagic field]}while under the effect of @emph{time stop.}

Tiny Hut

@strong{Tiny Hut}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a small crystal bead)

@strong{Range} 20 ft.

@strong{Effect} 20-ft.-radius sphere centered on your location

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.

The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior temperature below 0° or above 100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force destroys it.

The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have total concealment).

Tongues

@strong{Tongues}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, M/DF (a clay model of a ziggurat)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. @emph{Tongues}does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way.

@emph{Tongues}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Touch of Fatigue

@strong{Touch of Fatigue}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately [fatigued] for the spell's duration.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [fatigued]. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

Touch of Idiocy

@strong{Touch of Idiocy}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} no; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your successful melee touch attack applies a 1d6 penalty to the target's [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma] scores. This penalty can't reduce any of these scores below 1.

This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast some or all of its spells, if the requisite ability score drops below the minimum required to cast spells of that level.

Transformation

@strong{Transformation}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a @emph{potion of [bull's strength]}, which you drink and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

You become a fighting machine---stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to [Strength], [Dexterity], and [Constitution], a +4 natural armor bonus to [AC], a +5 competence bonus on [Fortitude] saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you multiple attacks).

You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.

Transmute Metal to Wood

@strong{Transmute Metal to Wood}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} all metal objects within a 40-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object; see text)

This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has [spell resistance] equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a --2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

Only @emph{[limited wish], [miracle], [wish],}or similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.

Transmute Mud to Rock

@strong{Transmute Mud to Rock}

@strong{School} transmutation [earth]; @strong{Level} druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (sand, lime, and water)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell permanently transforms normal mud or quicksand of any depth into soft stone (sandstone or a similar mineral).

Any creature in the mud is allowed a [Reflex] save to escape before the area is hardened to stone.

@emph{Transmute mud to rock}counters and dispels @emph{[transmute rock to mud]}.

Transmute Rock to Mud

@strong{Transmute Rock to Mud}

@strong{School} transmutation [earth]; @strong{Level} druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (clay and water)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

@strong{Duration} permanent; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a --2 penalty on attack rolls and [AC]. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.

If @emph{transmute rock to mud}is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on [Reflex] saves.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since @emph{transmute rock to mud}can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.

The mud remains until a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}or @emph{[transmute mud to rock]}spell restores its substance---but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

Transport via Plants

@strong{Transport via Plants}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} unlimited

@strong{Target} you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

@strong{Duration} 1 round

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can enter any normal plant (equal to your size or larger) and pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The plants must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you. If you are uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need merely designate direction and distance and the @emph{transport via plants}spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring along: a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported by the spell must be in physical contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.

The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from it.

Trap the Soul

@strong{Trap the Soul}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action or see text

@strong{Components} V, S, M (gem worth 1,000 gp per HD of the trapped creature)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} permanent; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes; see text

@emph{Trap the soul}forces a creature's life force (and its material body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once the gem imprisoning it is broken.

Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one of two ways.

@emph{Spell Completion}: First, the spell can be completed by speaking its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular spell at the subject. This allows [spell resistance] (if any) and a [Will] save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as well, any [spell resistance] is ignored and the save DC increases by 2. If the save or [spell resistance] is successful, the gem shatters.

@emph{Trigger Object}: The second method is far more insidious, for it tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A @emph{[sympathy]}spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of [spell resistance] or a save.

Tree Shape

@strong{Tree Shape}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 2, ranger 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree or shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The exact type of tree, as well as its appearance, is completely under your control. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a @emph{[detect magic]}spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to [AC] but have an effective [Dexterity] score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss @emph{tree shape}as a free action (instead of as a standard action).

Tree Stride

@strong{Tree Stride}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} druid 5, ranger 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until expended; see text

When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a tree, magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a tree, you can teleport from that particular tree to another tree. The trees you enter must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the following table.

@multitable {Other deciduous} {Transport Range} 
@headitem 
Type of Tree
 @tab Transport Range
@item 
Oak, ash, yew
 @tab 3,000 feet
@item 
Elm, linden
 @tab 2,000 feet
@item 
Other deciduous
 @tab 1,500 feet
@item 
Any coniferous
 @tab 1,000 feet
@end multitable

You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each transport is a full-round action.

You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you do not exit before the process is complete.

True Resurrection

@strong{True Resurrection}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 9

@strong{Casting Time}: 10 minutes

@strong{Components}V, S, M, DF (diamond worth 25,000 gp)

This spell functions like @emph{[raise dead],}except that you can resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of birth or death is the most common method).

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no [negative levels] (or [Constitution] points) and all of the prepared spells possessed by the creature when it died.

You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect constructs or undead creatures.

Even @emph{true resurrection}can't restore to life a creature who has died of old age.

True Seeing

@strong{True Seeing}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (an eye ointment that costs 250 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under @emph{[blur]}or @emph{[displacement]}effects, sees [invisible] creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of @emph{true seeing}conferred is 120 feet.

@emph{True seeing}, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. @emph{True seeing}does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use @emph{true seeing}through a @emph{crystal ball}or in conjunction with @emph{[clairaudience/clairvoyance]}.

True Strike

@strong{True Strike}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, F (small wooden replica of an archery target)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} see text

You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.

@chapter Playing the Game
@anchor{#playing-the-game}
While playing the PF RPG@emph{,}the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.

Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as “d#,” with the “#” representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the “d.” For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or -- after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character's skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a “4” and the other d10 rolls a “2,” then you've generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with “10,” “20,” “30,” and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you are must round a number, always round down.

As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges.

@node The Most Important Rule
@section The Most Important Rule
@anchor{#the-most-important-rule}
The rules presented are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of “house rules” that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the PF RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt.

@node Common Terms
@chapter Common Terms
@anchor{#common-terms}
The PF RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.

@strong{Ability Score}: Each creature has six ability scores: [Strength], [Dexterity], [Constitution], [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma]. These scores represent a creature's most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.

@strong{Action}: An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of different kinds of actions, such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action (see [Combat]).

@strong{Alignment}: Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single “N.”

@strong{Armor Class (AC)}: All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.

@strong{Base Attack Bonus (BAB)}: Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature's base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of full-round action---see [Combat]).

@strong{Bonus}: Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not “stack”)---only the greater bonus granted applies.

@strong{Caster Level (CL)}: Caster level represents a creature's power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster's level.

@strong{Class}: Classes represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the [core classes] or [prestige classes], since these are the most powerful. Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful ).

@strong{Check}: A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws.

@strong{Combat Maneuver}: This is an action taken in combat that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him (see [Combat]).

@strong{Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB)}: This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character's d20 roll.

@strong{Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD)}: This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature's CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.

@strong{Concentration Check}: When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a concentration check or fail to cast the spell ).

@strong{Creature}: A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.

@strong{Damage Reduction (DR)}: Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a “/” followed by the type, such as “10/cold iron.” Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted by the “---” symbol. See @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities} for more information.

@strong{Difficulty Class (DC)}: Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.

@strong{Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)}: Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.

@strong{Experience Points (XP)}: As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.

@strong{Feat}: A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.

@strong{Game Master (GM)}: A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM's duty is to provide a fair and fun game.

@strong{Hit Dice (HD)}: Hit Dice represent a creature's general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster's general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as “3d8.” This value is used to determine a creature's total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature's hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.

@strong{Hit Points (hp)}: Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature's hit points reach a negative total equal to its [Constitution] score, it dies.

@strong{Initiative}: Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.

@strong{Level}: A character's level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.

@strong{Monster}: Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.

@strong{Multiplying}: When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a ×2 multiplier twice, the result would be ×3, not ×4.

@strong{Nonplayer Character (NPC)}: These are characters controlled by the GM.

@strong{Penalty}: Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.

@strong{Player Character (Character, PC)}: These are the characters portrayed by the players.

@strong{Round}: Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.

@strong{Rounding}: Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.

@strong{Saving Throw}: When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a saving throw to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw---they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: [Fortitude] (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), [Reflex] (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as @emph{fireball}), and [Will] (used to resist mental attacks and spells).

@strong{Skill}: A skill represents a creature's ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.

@strong{Spell}: Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.

@strong{Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)}: Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).

@strong{Spell Resistance (SR)}: Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature's SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).

@strong{Stacking}: Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.

@strong{Supernatural Abilities (Su)}: Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability's description includes information on how it is used and its effects.

@strong{Turn}: In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see [Combat] for more details.

@node Generating a Character
@chapter Generating a Character
@anchor{#generating-a-character}
From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the PF RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character's concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.

Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your PF RPG character sheet, which can be found at the back of this book and photocopied for your convenience.

@strong{Step 1---Determine [Ability Score]s}: Start by generating your character's [ability score]s. These six scores determine your character's most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.

@strong{Step 2---Pick Your [Race]}: Next, pick your character's race, noting any modifiers to your [ability score]s and any other racial traits (see [Races]). There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her [Intelligence] modifier.

@strong{Step 3---Pick Your [Class]}: A character's class represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.

@strong{Step 4---Pick @ref{#skills,Skills} and Select @ref{#feats,Feats}}: Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and [Intelligence] modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many feats your character receives, based on his class and level, and select them from those presented in @ref{#feats,Feats}.

@strong{Step 5---Buy [Equipment]}: Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without the consent of your GM.

@strong{Step 6---Finishing Details}: Finally, you need to determine all of a character's details, including his starting [hit points] (hp), @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} ), [saving throws], [initiative modifier], and [attack values]. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character's name, [alignment], and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game. Additional rules (like age and alignment) are described in [Additional Rules].

@node Ability Scores
@chapter Ability Scores
@anchor{#ability-scores}
Each character has six ability scores that represent his character's most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character's skills and abilities. Each ability score generally ranges from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an average ability score is 10.

@node Generating Ability Scores
@section Generating Ability Scores
@anchor{#generating-ability-scores}
There are a number of different methods used to generate [ability score]s. Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility and randomness to character generation.

Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your [ability score]s due to your character's race---see [Races]) are applied after the scores are generated.

@strong{Standard:} Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your [ability score]s as you see fit. This method is less random than Classic and tends to create characters with above-average [ability score]s.

@strong{Classic:} Roll 3d6 and add the dice together. Record this total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these results to your [ability score]s as you see fit. This method is quite random, and some characters will have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific [ability score]s in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts, as their scores might not support given classes or personalities, and instead are best designed around their [ability score]s.

@strong{Heroic:} Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of the dice. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your [ability score]s as you see fit. This is less random than the Standard method and generates characters with mostly above-average scores.

@strong{Dice Pool:}Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.

Score Points ------- -------- 7 --4 8 --2 9 --1 10 0 11 1 12 2 13 3 14 5 15 7 16 10 17 13 18 17

: Table: Ability Score Costs

@* Campaign Type Points ------------------ -------- Low Fantasy 10 Standard Fantasy 15 High Fantasy 20 Epic Fantasy 25

: Table: Ability Score Points

@* @strong{Purchase:} Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his [ability score]s. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. [See Table: Ability Score Costs] for the costs of each score. After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.

The number of points you have to spend using the purchase method depends on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for a character is 15 points. Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are typically built using as few as 3 points. [See Table: Ability Score Points] for a number of possible point values depending on the style of campaign. The purchase method emphasizes player choice and creates equally balanced characters. This system is typically used for organized play events, such as the PF Society (visit @strong{@uref{http://paizo.com/PFSociety,paizo.com/PFSociety}} for more details on this exciting campaign).

@node Determine Bonuses
@subsection Determine Bonuses
@anchor{#determine-bonuses}
Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from --5 to +5. [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells] shows the modifier for each score. The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative modifier is called a penalty. The table also shows bonus spells, which you'll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.

@node Abilities and Spellcasters
@section Abilities and Spellcasters
@anchor{#abilities-and-spellcasters}
The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: [Intelligence] for wizards; [Wisdom] for clerics, druids, and rangers; and [Charisma] for bards, paladins, and sorcerers. In addition to having a high [ability score], a spellcaster must be of a high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a given spell level. See the class descriptions in @ref{#classes,Classes} for details.

@node Strength 
@subsection Strength )
@anchor{#strength}
Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or “melee”) combat, such as fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the maximum amount of weight your character can carry. A character with a Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious. Some creatures do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at all to Strength-based skills or checks.

You apply your character's Strength modifier to:

@itemize
@item
[Melee attack] rolls.
@item
@ref{#damage,Damage} rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown weapon, including a sling. (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive only half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks receive 1--1/2 times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a composite bow.)
@item
@ref{#climb,Climb} and @ref{#swim,Swim} checks. Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).
@end itemize

@node Dexterity Dex
@subsection Dexterity (Dex)
@anchor{#dexterity-dex}
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for rogues, but it's also useful for characters who wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or sling. A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving and is effectively immobile (but not unconscious).

You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

@itemize
@item
[Ranged attack] rolls, including those for attacks made with bows, crossbows, throwing axes, and many ranged spell attacks like @emph{scorching ray} or @emph{searing light}.
@item
@ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} ), provided that the character can react to the attack.
@item
[Reflex saving throws], for avoiding @emph{fireballs} and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly.
@item
@ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics}, @ref{#disable-device,Disable Device}, @ref{#escape-artist,Escape Artist}, @ref{#fly,Fly}, @ref{#ride,Ride}, @ref{#sleight-of-hand,Sleight of Hand}, and @ref{#stealth,Stealth} checks.
@end itemize

@node Constitution Con
@subsection Constitution (Con)
@anchor{#constitution-con}
Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability is important for all classes. Some creatures, such as undead and constructs, do not have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for any Constitution-based checks. A character with a Constitution score of 0 is dead.

You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:

@itemize
@item
Each roll of a [Hit Die] (though a penalty can never drop a result below 1---that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point each time he advances in level).
@item
[Fortitude saving throws], for resisting poison, disease, and similar threats.
@end itemize

If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.

@node Intelligence Int
@subsection Intelligence (Int)
@anchor{#intelligence-int}
Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for wizards because it affects their spellcasting ability in many ways. Creatures of animal-level instinct have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of understanding speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an Intelligence score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an Intelligence score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based skills or checks.

You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

@itemize
@item
The number of bonus [languages] your character knows at the start of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence is lower than 3.
@item
The number of skill points gained each level, though your character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.
@item
@ref{#appraise,Appraise}, @ref{#craft,Craft}, @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge}, @ref{#linguistics,Linguistics}, and @ref{#spellcraft,Spellcraft} checks.
@end itemize

A [wizard] gains bonus spells based on his Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level.

@node Wisdom Wis
@subsection Wisdom (Wis)
@anchor{#wisdom-wis}
Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids, and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.

You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

@itemize
@item
[Will saving throws] (for negating the effects of @emph{charm person} and other spells).
@item
@ref{#heal,Heal}, @ref{#perception,Perception}, @ref{#profession,Profession}, @ref{#sense-motive,Sense Motive}, and @ref{#survival,Survival} checks.
@end itemize

[Clerics], [druids], and [rangers] get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.

@node Charisma Cha
@subsection Charisma (Cha)
@anchor{#charisma-cha}
Charisma measures a character's personality, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since it affects their ability to channel energy. For undead creatures, Charisma is a measure of their unnatural “lifeforce.” Every creature has a Charisma score. A character with a Charisma score of 0 is not able to exert himself in any way and is unconscious.

You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

@itemize
@item
@ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}, @ref{#disguise,Disguise}, @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal}, @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}, @ref{#perform,Perform}, and @ref{#use-magic-device,Use Magic Device} checks.
@item
Checks that represent attempts to influence others.
@item
[Channel energy] DCs for [clerics] and [paladins] attempting to harm undead foes.
@end itemize

[Bards], [paladins], and [sorcerers] gain a number of bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a bard, paladin, or sorcerer spell is 10 + the spell's level.

@node Designing Encounters
@chapter Designing Encounters
@anchor{#designing-encounters}
The heart of any adventure is its encounters. An encounter is any event that puts a specific problem before the PCs that they must solve. Most encounters present combat with monsters or hostile NPCs, but there are many other types---a trapped corridor, a political interaction with a suspicious king, a dangerous passage over a rickety rope bridge, an awkward argument with a friendly NPC who suspects a PC has betrayed him, or anything that adds drama to the game. Brain-teasing puzzles, roleplaying challenges, and skill checks are all classic methods for resolving encounters, but the most complex encounters to build are the most common ones---combat encounters.

When designing a combat encounter, you first decide what level of challenge you want your PCs to face, then follow the steps outlined below.

Step 1---Determine APL: Determine the average level of your player characters---this is their Average Party Level (APL for short). You should round this value to the nearest whole number (this is one of the few exceptions to the round down rule). Note that these encounter creation guidelines assume a group of four or five PCs. If your group contains six or more players, add one to their average level. If your group contains three or fewer players, subtract one from their average level. For example, if your group consists of six players, two of which are 4th level and four of which are 5th level, their APL is 6th (28 total levels, divided by six players, rounding up, and adding one to the final result).

Step 2---Determine CR: Challenge Rating (or CR) is a convenient number used to indicate the relative danger presented by a monster, trap, hazard, or other encounter---the higher the CR, the more dangerous the encounter. Refer to Table: Encounter Design to determine the Challenge Rating your group should face, depending on the difficulty of the challenge you want and the group's APL.

Step 3---Build the Encounter: Determine the total XP award for the encounter by looking it up by its CR on Table: Experience Point Awards. This gives you an “XP budget” for the encounter. Every creature, trap, and hazard is worth an amount of XP determined by its CR, as noted on Table: Experience Point Awards. To build your encounter, simply add creatures, traps, and hazards whose combined XP does not exceed the total XP budget for your encounter. It's easiest to add the highest CR challenges to the encounter first, filling out the remaining total with lesser challenges.

For example, let's say you want your group of six 8th-level PCs to face a challenging encounter against a group of gargoyles (each CR 4) and their stone giant boss (CR 8). The PCs have an APL of 9, and table 12--1 tells you that a challenging encounter for your APL 9 group is a CR 10 encounter---worth 9,600 XP according to Table: Experience Point Awards. At CR 8, the stone giant is worth 4,800 XP, leaving you with another 4,800 points in your XP budget for the gargoyles. Gargoyles are CR 4 each, and thus worth 1,200 XP apiece, meaning that the encounter can support four gargoyles in its XP budget. You could further refine the encounter by including only three gargoyles, leaving you with 1,200 XP to spend on a trio of Small earth elemental servants (at CR 1, each is worth 400 XP) to further aid the stone giant.

Adding NPCs: Creatures whose Hit Dice are solely a factor of their class levels and not a feature of their race, such as all of the PC races detailed in [Races], are factored into combats a little differently than normal monsters or monsters with class levels. A creature that possesses class levels, but does not have any racial Hit Dice, is factored in as a creature with a CR equal to its class levels --1. A creature that only possesses [non-player class] levels (such as a warrior or adept) is factored in as a creature with a CR equal to its class levels --2. If this reduction would reduce a creature's CR to below 1, its CR drops one step on the following progression for each step below 1 this reduction would make: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8.

High CR Encounters: The XP values for high-CR encounters can seem quite daunting. Table: CR Equivalencies provides some simple formulas to help you manage these large numbers. When using a large number of identical creatures, this chart can help simplify the math by combining them into one CR, making it easier to find their total XP value. For example, using this chart, four CR 8 creatures (worth 4,800 XP each) are equivalent to a CR 12 creature (worth 19,200 XP).

Ad Hoc CR Adjustments: While you can adjust a specific monster's CR by advancing it, applying templates, or giving it class levels, you can also adjust an encounter's difficulty by applying ad hoc adjustments to the encounter or creature itself. Listed here are three additional ways you can alter an encounter's difficulty.

Favorable Terrain for the PCs: An encounter against a monster that's out of its favored element (like a yeti encountered in a sweltering cave with lava, or an enormous dragon encountered in a tiny room) gives the PCs an advantage. Build the encounter as normal, but when you award experience for the encounter, do so as if the encounter were one CR lower than its actual CR.

Unfavorable Terrain for the PCs: Monsters are designed with the assumption that they are encountered in their favored terrain---encountering a water-breathing aboleth in an underwater area does not increase the CR for that encounter, even though none of the PCs breathe water. If, on the other hand, the terrain impacts the encounter significantly (such as an encounter against a creature with blindsight in an area that suppresses all light), you can, at your option, increase the effective XP award as if the encounter's CR were one higher.

NPC Gear Adjustments: You can significantly increase or decrease the power level of an NPC with class levels by adjusting the NPC's gear. The combined value of an NPC's gear is given in @ref{#creating-npcs,Creating NPCs} on Table: NPC Gear. A classed NPC encountered with no gear should have his CR reduced by 1 (provided that loss of gear actually hampers the NPC), while a classed NPC that instead has gear equivalent to that of a PC (as listed on Table: Character Wealth by Level) has a CR of 1 higher than his actual CR. Be careful awarding NPCs this extra gear, though---especially at high levels, where you can blow out your entire adventure's treasure budget in one fell swoop!

@node Awarding Experience
@section Awarding Experience
@anchor{#awarding-experience}
PF Roleplaying Game characters advance in level by defeating monsters, overcoming challenges, and completing adventures---in so doing, they earn experience points (XP for short). Although you can award experience points as soon as a challenge is overcome, this can quickly disrupt the flow of game play. It's easier to simply award experience points at the end of a game session---that way, if a character earns enough XP to gain a level, he won't disrupt the game while he levels up his character. He can instead take the time between game sessions to do that.

Keep a list of the CRs of all the monsters, traps, obstacles, and roleplaying encounters the PCs overcome. At the end of each session, award XP to each PC that participated. Each monster, trap, and obstacle awards a set amount of XP, as determined by its CR, regardless of the level of the party in relation to the challenge, although you should never bother awarding XP for challenges that have a CR of 10 or more lower than the APL. Pure roleplaying encounters generally have a CR equal to the average level of the party (although particularly easy or difficult roleplaying encounters might be one higher or lower). There are two methods for awarding XP. While one is more exact, it requires a calculator for ease of use. The other is slightly more abstract.

Exact XP: Once the game session is over, take your list of defeated CR numbers and look up the value of each CR on Table: Experience Point Awards under the “Total XP” column. Add up the XP values for each CR and then divide this total by the number of characters---each character earns an amount of XP equal to this number.

Abstract XP: Simply add up the individual XP awards listed for a group of the appropriate size. In this case, the division is done for you---you need only total up all the awards to determine how many XP to award to each PC.

Story Awards: Feel free to award Story Awards when players conclude a major storyline or make an important accomplishment. These awards should be worth double the amount of experience points for a CR equal to the APL. Particularly long or difficult story arcs might award even more, at your discretion as GM.

* For 1st-level PCs, see table 6--1 in [Equipment].

As PCs gain levels, the amount of treasure they carry and use increases as well. The PF Roleplaying Game assumes that all PCs of equivalent level have roughly equal amounts of treasure and magic items. Since the primary income for a PC derives from treasure and loot gained from adventuring, it's important to moderate the wealth and hoards you place in your adventures. To aid in placing treasure, the amount of treasure and magic items the PCs receive for their adventures is tied to the Challenge Rating of the encounters they face---the higher an encounter's CR, the more treasure it can award.

Table: Character Wealth by Level lists the amount of treasure each PC is expected to have at a specific level. Note that this table assumes a standard fantasy game. Low-fantasy games might award only half this value, while high-fantasy games might double the value. It is assumed that some of this treasure is consumed in the course of an adventure (such as potions and scrolls), and that some of the less useful items are sold for half value so more useful gear can be purchased.

Table: Character Wealth by Level can also be used to budget gear for characters starting above 1st level, such as a new character created to replace a dead one. Characters should spend no more than half their total wealth on any single item. For a balanced approach, PCs that are built after 1st level should spend no more than 25% of their wealth on weapons, 25% on armor and protective devices, 25% on other magic items, 15% on disposable items like potions, scrolls, and wands, and 10% on ordinary gear and coins. Different character types might spend their wealth differently than these percentages suggest; for example, arcane casters might spend very little on weapons but a great deal more on other magic items and disposable items.

Table: Treasure Values per Encounter lists the amount of treasure each encounter should award based on the average level of the PCs and the speed of the campaign's XP progression (slow, medium, or fast). Easy encounters should award treasure one level lower than the PCs' average level. Challenging, hard, and epic encounters should award treasure one, two, or three levels higher than the PCs' average level, respectively. If you are running a low-fantasy game, cut these values in half. If you are running a high-fantasy game, double these values.

Encounters against NPCs typically award three times the treasure a monster-based encounter awards, due to NPC gear. To compensate, make sure the PCs face off against a pair of additional encounters that award little in the way of treasure. Animals, plants, constructs, mindless undead, oozes, and traps are great “low treasure” encounters. Alternatively, if the PCs face a number of creatures with little or no treasure, they should have the opportunity to acquire a number of significantly more valuable objects sometime in the near future to make up for the imbalance. As a general rule, PCs should not own any magic item worth more than half their total character wealth, so make sure to check before awarding expensive magic items.

@section Building a Treasure Hoard
@anchor{#building-a-treasure-hoard}
While it's often enough to simply tell your players they've found 5,000 gp in gems and 10,000 gp in jewelry, it's generally more interesting to give details. Giving treasure a personality can not only help the verisimilitude of your game, but can sometimes trigger new adventures. The information on the below can help you randomly determine types of additional treasure---suggested values are given for many of the objects, but feel free to assign values to the objects as you see fit. It's easiest to place the expensive items first---if you wish, you can even randomly roll magic items, using the tables in [Magic Items], to determine what sort of items are present in the hoard. Once you've consumed a sizable portion of the hoard's value, the remainder can simply be loose coins or nonmagical treasure with values arbitrarily assigned as you see fit.

Coins: Coins in a treasure hoard can consist of copper, silver, gold, and platinum pieces---silver and gold are the most common, but you can divide the coinage as you wish. Coins and their value relative to each other are described at the start of [Equipment].

Gems: Although you can assign any value to a gemstone, some are inherently more valuable than others. Use the value categories below (and their associated gemstones) as guidelines when assigning values to gemstones.

Low-Quality Gems (10 gp): agates; azurite; blue quartz; hematite; lapis lazuli; malachite; obsidian; rhodochrosite; tigereye; turquoise; freshwater (irregular) pearl

Semi-Precious Gems (50 gp): bloodstone; carnelian; chalcedony; chrysoprase; citrine; jasper; moonstone; onyx; peridot; rock crystal (clear quartz); sard; sardonyx; rose, smoky, or star rose quartz; zircon

Medium Quality Gemstones (100 gp): amber; amethyst; chrysoberyl; coral; red or brown-green garnet; jade; jet; white, golden, pink, or silver pearl; red, red-brown, or deep green spinel; tourmaline

High Quality Gemstones (500 gp): alexandrite; aquamarine; violet garnet; black pearl; deep blue spinel; golden yellow topaz

Jewels (1,000 gp): emerald; white, black, or fire opal; blue sapphire; fiery yellow or rich purple corundum; blue or black star sapphire

Grand Jewels (5,000 gp or more): clearest bright green emerald; diamond; jacinth; ruby

Nonmagical Treasures: This expansive category includes jewelry, fine clothing, trade goods, alchemical items, masterwork objects, and more. Unlike gemstones, many of these objects have set values, but you can always increase an object's value by having it be bejeweled or of particularly fine craftsmanship. This increase in cost doesn't grant additional abilities---a gem-encrusted masterwork cold iron scimitar worth 40,000 gp functions the same as a typical masterwork cold iron scimitar worth the base price of 330 gp. Listed below are numerous examples of several types of nonmagical treasures, along with typical values.

Fine Artwork (100 gp or more): Although some artwork is composed of precious materials, the value of most paintings, sculptures, works of literature, fine clothing, and the like come from their skill and craftsmanship. Artwork is often bulky or cumbersome to move and fragile to boot, making salvage an adventure in and of itself.

Jewelry, Minor (50 gp): This category includes relatively small pieces of jewelry crafted from materials like brass, bronze, copper, ivory, or even exotic woods, sometimes set with tiny or flawed low-quality gems. Minor jewelry includes rings, bracelets, and earrings.

Jewelry, Normal (100--500 gp): Most jewelry is made of silver, gold, jade, or coral, often ornamented with semi-precious or even medium-quality gemstones. Normal jewelry includes all types of minor jewelry plus armbands, necklaces, and brooches.

Jewelry, Precious (500 gp or more): Truly precious jewelry is crafted from gold, mithral, platinum, or similar rare metals. Such objects include normal jewelry types plus crowns, scepters, pendants, and other large items.

Masterwork Tools (100--300 gp): This category includes masterwork weapons, armor, and skill kits---see [Equipment] for more details and costs for these items.

Mundane Gear (up to 1,000 gp): There are many valuable items of mundane or alchemical nature detailed in [Equipment] that can be utilized as treasure. Most of the alchemical items are portable and valuable, but other objects like locks, holy symbols, spyglasses, fine wine, or fine clothing work well as interesting bits of treasure. Trade goods can even serve as treasure---10 pounds of saffron, for example, is worth 150 gp.

Treasure Maps and Other Intelligence (variable): Items like treasure maps, deeds to ships and homes, lists of informants or guard rosters, passwords, and the like can also make fun items of treasure---you can set the value of such items at any amount you wish, and often they can serve double-duty as adventure seeds.

Magic Items: Of course, the discovery of a magic item is the true prize for any adventurer. You should take care with the placement of magic items in a hoard---it's generally more satisfying for many players to find a magic item rather than purchase it, so there's no crime in placing items that happen to be those your players can use! An extensive list of magic items (and their costs) is given in [Magic Items].

@multitable {Magic Item Category} {Average Value} 
@headitem 
Magic Item Category
 @tab Average Value
@item 
Minor Item
 @tab 1,000 gp
@item 
Medium Item
 @tab 10,000 gp
@item 
Major Item
 @tab 40,000 gp
@end multitable

Although you should generally place items with careful consideration of their likely effects on your campaign, it can be fun and save time to generate magic items in a treasure hoard randomly. You can “purchase” random die rolls of magic items for a treasure hoard at the following prices, subtracting the indicated amount from your treasure budget and then rolling on the appropriate column on table 15--2 in [Magic Items] to determine what item is in the treasure hoard. Take care with this approach, though! It's easy, through the luck (or unluck) of the dice to bloat your game with too much treasure or deprive it of the same. Random magic item placement should always be tempered with good common sense by the GM.

@node Cost of Living
@chapter Cost of Living
@anchor{#cost-of-living}
An adventurer's primary source of income is treasure, and his primary purchases are tools and items he needs to continue adventuring---spell components, weapons, magic items, potions, and the like. Yet what about things like food? Rent? Taxes? Bribes? Idle purchases?

You can certainly handle these minor expenditures in detail during play, but tracking every time a PC pays for a room, buys water, or pays a gate tax can swiftly become obnoxious and tiresome. If you're not really into tracking these minor costs of living, you can choose to simply ignore these small payments. A more realistic and easier-to-use method is to have PCs pay a recurring cost of living tax. At the start of every game month, a PC must pay an amount of gold equal to the lifestyle bracket he wishes to live in---if he can't afford his desired bracket, he drops down to the first one he can afford.

Destitute (0 gp/month): The PC is homeless and lives in the wilderness or on the streets. A destitute character must track every purchase, and may need to resort to Survival checks or theft to feed himself.

Poor (3 gp/month): The PC lives in common rooms of taverns, with his parents, or in some other communal situation---this is the lifestyle of most untrained laborers and commoners. He need not track purchases of meals or taxes that cost 1 sp or less.

Average (10 gp/month): The PC lives in his own apartment, small house, or similar location---this is the lifestyle of most trained or skilled experts or warriors. He can secure any nonmagical item worth 1 gp or less from his home in 1d10 minutes, and need not track purchases of common meals or taxes that cost 1 gp or less.

Wealthy (100 gp/month): The PC has a sizable home or a nice suite of rooms in a fine inn. He can secure any nonmagical item worth 5 gp or less from his belongings in his home in 1d10 minutes, and need only track purchases of meals or taxes in excess of 10 gp.

Extravagant (1,000 gp/month): The PC lives in a mansion, castle, or other extravagant home---he might even own the building in question. This is the lifestyle of most aristocrats. He can secure any nonmagical item worth 25 gp or less from his belongings in his home in 1d10 minutes. He need only track purchases of meals or taxes in excess of 100 gp.

@node Beyond 20th Level
@chapter Beyond 20th Level
@anchor{#beyond-20th-level}
Although @ref{#classes,Classes} doesn't describe what happens after 20th level, this isn't to say that there are no resources available to you should you wish to continue your campaign on to 21st level and beyond. Rules for epic-level play like this exist in numerous products that are compatible with the PF Roleplaying Game, although in many cases these alternative rules can provide unanticipated problems. For example, if your campaign world is populated by creatures and villains who, at the upper limit of power, can challenge a 20th-level character, where will epic-level PCs go for challenges? You might be looking at creating an entirely new campaign setting, one set on different planes, planets, or dimensions from the one where your players spent their first 20 levels, and that's a lot of work.

Paizo Publishing may eventually publish rules to take your game into these epic realms, but if you can't wait and would rather not use existing open content rules for epic-level play, you can use the following brief guidelines to continue beyond 20th level. Note that these guidelines aren't robust enough to keep the game vibrant and interesting on their own for much longer past 20th level, but they should do in a pinch for a campaign that needs, say, 22 or 23 experience levels to wrap up. Likewise, you can use these rules to create super-powerful NPCs for 20th-level characters to face.

Experience Points: To gain a level beyond 20th, a character must double the experience points needed to achieve the previous level. Thus, assuming the medium XP progression, a 20th-level character needs 2,100,000 XP to become 21st level, since he needed 1,050,000 XP to reach 20th level from 19th. He'd then need 4,200,000 XP to reach 22nd level, 8,400,000 XP to reach 23rd, and so on.

Scaling Powers: Hit dice, base attack bonuses, and saving throws continue to increase at the same rate beyond 20th level, as appropriate for the class in question. Note that no character can have more than 4 attacks based on its base attack bonus. Note also that, before long, the difference between good saving throws and poor saving throws becomes awkwardly large---the further you get from 20th level, the more noticeable this difference grows, and for high-level characters, bolstering their poor saving throws should become increasingly important. Class abilities that have a set, increasing rate, such as a barbarian's damage reduction, a fighter's bonus feats and weapon training, a paladin's smite evil, or a rogue's sneak attack continue to progress at the appropriate rate.

Spells: A spellcaster's caster level continues to increase by one for each level beyond 20th level. Every odd-numbered level, a spellcaster gains access to a new level of spell one above his previous maximum level, gaining one spell slot in that new level. These spell slots can be used to prepare or cast spells adjusted by metamagic feats or any known spell of lower levels. Every even-numbered level, a spellcaster gains additional spell slots equal to the highest level spell he can currently cast. He can split these new slots any way he wants among the slots he currently has access to.

For example, a 21st-level wizard gains a single 10th-level spell slot, in which he can prepare any spell of level 1st through 9th, or in which he can prepare a metamagic spell that results in an effective spell level of 10 (such as extended summon monster IX, or quickened disintegrate). At 22nd level he gains 10 spell-levels' worth of new spell slots, and can gain 10 1st-level spells per day, two 5th-level spells per day, one 7th-level and one 3rd-level spell per day, or one more 10th-level spell per day. At 23rd level, he gains a single 11th-level spell slot, and so on.

Spellcasters who have a limited number of spells known (such as bards and sorcerers) can opt out of the benefits they gain (either a new level of spells or a number of spell slots) for that level and in exchange learn two more spells of any level they can currently cast.

You might want to further adjust the rate of spell level gain for classes (like paladins and rangers) who gain spells more slowly than more dedicated spellcaster classes.

Multiclassing/Prestige Classes: The simplest way to progress beyond 20th level is to simply multiclass or take levels in a prestige class, in which case you gain all of the abilities of the new class level normally. This effectively treats 20th level as a hard limit for class level, but not as a hard limit for total character level.

@node Class Features
@section Class Features
@anchor{#class-features}
All of the following are class features of the adept NPC class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Adepts are skilled with all simple weapons. Adepts are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.

@strong{Spells}: An adept casts divine spells, which are drawn from the adept spell list. Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast @emph{cure} or @emph{inflict} spells.

To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a [Wisdom] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's [Wisdom] modifier.

Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each day during which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.

Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table 14--1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom] score.

Where Table 14--1 indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her [Wisdom] score for that spell level.

Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on the adept's magical tradition.

@strong{Summon Familiar}: At 2nd level, an adept can call a [familiar], just as a wizard can using the arcane bond ability.

@anchor{#class-features-4}
The following is a class feature of the warrior NPC class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: The warrior is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons and with all types of armor and shields.

@strong{Fabricate}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} see text

@strong{Components} V, S, M (the original material, which costs the same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} up to 10 cu. ft./level; see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by the @emph{fabricate}spell. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.

You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be affected by the spell.

Faerie Fire

@strong{Faerie Fire}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} druid 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by @emph{faerie fire} take a --20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical @emph{darkness}effect functions normally), @emph{[blur]}, @emph{[displacement], [invisibility],} or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The @emph{faerie fire}can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The @emph{faerie fire}does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

False Life

@strong{False Life}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of blood)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text

You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).

False Vision

@strong{False Vision}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (crushed jade worth 250 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Area} 40-ft.-radius emanation

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates a subtle illusion, causing any divination (scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this spell to instead receive a false image (as the @emph{[major image]}spell), as defined by you at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren't concentrating, the image remains static.

Fear

@strong{Fear}

@strong{School} necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (the heart of a hen or a white feather)

@strong{Range} 30 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area to become [panicked] unless it succeeds on a [Will] save. If cornered, a [panicked] creature begins cowering. If the [Will] save succeeds, the creature is [shaken] for 1 round.

Feather Fall

@strong{Feather Fall}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 immediate action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} until landing or 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless) or [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. @emph{Feather fall}instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

@emph{Feather fall}works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

Feeblemind

@strong{Feeblemind}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, or glass spheres)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Target creature's [Intelligence] and [Charisma] scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use [Intelligence]- or [Charisma]-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a @emph{[heal]}, @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[miracle]}, or @emph{[wish]}spell is used to cancel the effect of the @emph{feeblemind}. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a --4 penalty on its saving throw.

Find the Path

@strong{Find the Path}

@strong{School}divination; @strong{Level}bard 6, cleric 6, druid 6

@strong{Casting Time}3 rounds

@strong{Components}V, S, F (a set of divination counters)

@strong{Range}personal or touch

@strong{Target}you or creature touched

@strong{Duration}10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}none or [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}no or yes (harmless)

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a prominent specified destination, such as a city, keep, lake, or dungeon. The locale can be outdoors or underground, as long as it is prominent. For example, a hunter's cabin is not prominent enough, but a logging camp is. @emph{Find the path}works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense what cavern corridor to take when a choice presents itself@emph{.}The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. @emph{Find the path}can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a @emph{[maze]}spell in a single round, specifying the destination as “outside the [maze].” This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.

Find Traps

@strong{Find Traps}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You gain an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on Perception checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect. You receive a check to notice traps within 10 feet of you, even if you are not actively searching for them. Note that @emph{find traps}grants no ability to disable the traps that you may find.

Finger of Death

@strong{Finger of Death}

@strong{School} necromancy [death]; @strong{Level} druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the target's [Fortitude] saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.

Fireball

@strong{Fireball}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{fireball}spell generates a searing explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the @emph{fireball}is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the @emph{fireball}at that point. An early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The @emph{fireball}sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the @emph{fireball}may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

Fire Seeds

@strong{Fire Seeds}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (acorns or holly berries)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} up to four acorns or up to eight holly berries

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level or until used

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Reflex] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Depending on the version of @emph{fire seeds}you choose, you turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.

@emph{Acorn Grenades}: As many as four acorns turn into special thrown splash weapons. An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20 feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) divided among the acorns as you wish. No acorn can deal more than 10d4 points of damage.

Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to the explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the explosion. This explosion of fire ignites any combustible materials adjacent to the target.

@emph{Holly Berry Bombs}: You turn as many as eight holly berries into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that makes a successful [Reflex] saving throw takes only half damage.

Fire Shield

@strong{Fire Shield}

@strong{School} evocation [fire or cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (phosphorus for the @emph{warm shield;}a firefly or glowworm for the @emph{chill shield)}

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your @emph{fire shield}.

Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage (if you choose a @emph{chill shield}) or fire damage (if you choose a @emph{warm shield}). If the attacker has [spell resistance], it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green if the @emph{chill shield}is cast, violet or red if the @emph{warm shield}is employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.

@emph{Chill Shield}: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a [Reflex] save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

@emph{Warm Shield}: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a [Reflex] save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

Fire Storm

@strong{Fire Storm}

@strong{School}evocation [fire]; @strong{Level}cleric 8, druid 7

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area}two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes

When a @emph{fire storm}spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their [Reflex] save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 [Reflex] save.

Fire Trap

@strong{Fire Trap}

@strong{School} abjuration [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} object touched

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Fire trap}creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A @emph{fire trap}spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.

When casting @emph{fire trap,}you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.

A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A @emph{[knock]}spell does not bypass a @emph{fire trap}. An unsuccessful @emph{[dispel magic]}spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.

You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.

Magic traps such as @emph{fire trap}are hard to detect and disable. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{fire trap}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's @emph{fire trap}or DC 29 for the arcane version).

Flame Arrow

@strong{Flame Arrow}

@strong{School} transmutation [fire]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of oil and a small piece of flint)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} fifty projectiles, all of which must be together at the time of casting

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell allows you to turn ammunition (such as arrows, crossbow bolts, shuriken, and sling stones) into fiery projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.

Flame Blade

@strong{Flame Blade}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} sword-like beam

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the @emph{flame blade}are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your [Strength] modifier does not apply to the damage. A @emph{flame blade}can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

Flame Strike

@strong{Flame Strike}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40-ft. high)

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{flame strike}evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

Flaming Sphere

@strong{Flaming Sphere}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (tallow, brimstone, and powdered iron)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} 5-ft.-diameter sphere

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful [Reflex] save negates that damage. A @emph{flaming sphere}rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A @emph{flaming sphere}winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

Flare

@strong{Flare}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} bard 0, druid 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} burst of light

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst in front of a single creature, that creature is [dazzled] for 1 minute unless it makes a successful [Fortitude] save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already [dazzled], are not affected by @emph{flare}.

Flesh to Stone

@strong{Flesh to Stone}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (lime, water, and earth)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as @emph{deathwatch}.

Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

Floating Disk

@strong{Floating Disk}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of mercury)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} 3-ft.-diameter disk of force

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

Fly

@strong{Fly}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a wing feather)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a @emph{fly}spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a @emph{fly}spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on @ref{#fly,Fly} skill checks equal to 1/2 your caster level.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if the @emph{fly}spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an @emph{[antimagic field]}.

Fog Cloud

@strong{Fog Cloud}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)

@strong{Effect} fog spreads in 20-ft. radius

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including [darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

Forbiddance

@strong{Forbiddance}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 6

@strong{Casting Time} 6 rounds

@strong{Components} V, S, M (holy water and incense worth 1,500 gp, plus 1,500 gp per 60-foot cube), DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 60-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Forbiddance}seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as @emph{[dimension door]}and @emph{[teleport]),}[plane shift]ing@emph{,}astral travel, ethereal travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail automatically.

In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is affected as normal.

@emph{Alignments identical}: No effect. The creature may enter the area freely (although not by planar travel).

@emph{Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or good/evil}: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful [Will] save halves the damage, and [spell resistance] applies.

@emph{Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil}: The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful [Will] save halves the damage, and [spell resistance] applies.

At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this option (and the password) at the time of casting. Adding a password requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

@emph{[Dispel magic]}does not dispel a @emph{forbiddance}effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level.

You can't have multiple overlapping @emph{forbiddance}effects. In such a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.

Forcecage

@strong{Forcecage}

@strong{School}evocation [force]; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (ruby dust worth 500 gp)

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area}barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft. cube)

@strong{Duration}1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Reflex] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}no

This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Like a @emph{[wall of force]}, a @emph{forcecage} resists @emph{[dispel magic],}although a @emph{[mage's disjunction]} still functions@emph{.}The walls of a @emph{forcecage}can be damaged by spells as normal, except for @emph{[disintegrate],}which automatically destroys it. The walls of a @emph{forcecage} can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a @emph{[sphere of annihilation]}or @emph{[rod of cancellation]} instantly destroys a @emph{forcecage.}

@emph{Barred Cage}: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a @emph{[wall of force]}spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.

@emph{Windowless Cell}: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

Forceful Hand

@strong{Forceful Hand}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as @emph{[interposing hand]}, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The @emph{forceful hand} gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its [CMB] for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its [Strength] score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. @emph{Forceful hand}prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the @emph{forceful}hand and the target closer to you. The @emph{forceful hand} can instead be directed to interpose itself, as @emph{[interposing hand]} does.

Foresight

@strong{Foresight}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a hummingbird's feather)

@strong{Range} personal or touch

@strong{Target} see text

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no or yes (harmless)

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once @emph{foresight}is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or [flat-footed]. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to [AC] and on [Reflex] saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to [AC] and [Reflex] saves.

Form of the Dragon

@strong{Form of the Dragon I}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (a scale of the dragon type you plan to assume)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

@strong{Save}see below; @strong{SR}no

You become a Medium chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain a +4 size bonus to [Strength], a +2 size bonus to [Constitution], a +4 natural armor bonus, fly 60 feet (poor), [darkvision] 60 feet, a breath weapon, and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite (1d8), two claws (1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). Your breath weapon and resistance depend on the type of dragon. You can only use the breath weapon once per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage and allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. In addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities, as noted below.

@emph{Black dragon}: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, swim 60 feet

@emph{Blue dragon}: 60-foot line of electricity, resist electricity 20, burrow 20 feet

@emph{Green dragon}: 30-foot cone of acid, resist acid 20, swim 40 feet

@emph{Red dragon}: 30-foot cone of fire, resist fire 30, vulnerability to cold

@emph{White dragon}: 30-foot cone of cold, resist cold 20, swim 60 feet, vulnerability to fire

@emph{Brass dragon}: 60-foot line of fire, resist fire 20, burrow 30 feet, vulnerability to cold

@emph{Bronze dragon}: 60-foot line of electricity, resist electricity 20, swim 60 feet

@emph{Copper dragon}: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, @emph{[spider climb]} (always active)

@emph{Gold dragon}: 30-foot cone of fire, resist fire 20, swim 60 feet

@emph{Silver dragon}: 30-foot cone of cold, resist cold 30, vulnerability to fire

@strong{Form of the Dragon II}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as @emph{[form of the dragon I]}except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to [Strength], a +4 size bonus to [Constitution], a +6 natural armor bonus, fly 90 feet (poor), [darkvision] 60 feet, a breath weapon, [DR] 5/magic, and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite (2d6), two claws (1d8), two wing attacks (1d6), and one tail slap attack (1d8). You can only use the breath weapon twice per casting of this spell, and you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 8d8 points of damage and allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot cones.

@strong{Form of the Dragon III}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions as @emph{[form of the dragon II]}save that it also allows you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to [Strength], a +8 size bonus to [Constitution], a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor), [blindsense] 60 feet, [darkvision] 120 feet, a breath weapon, [DR] 10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and immunity to one element (of the same type @emph{[form of the dragon I]}grants resistance to). You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.

Fox's Cunning

@strong{Fox's Cunning}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (hairs or dung from a fox)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Intelligence], adding the usual benefits to [Intelligence]-based skill checks and other uses of the [Intelligence] modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on [Intelligence]) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Intelligence], but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks.

@strong{Fox's Cunning, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[fox's cunning]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Freedom

@strong{Freedom}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) or see text

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict movement, including @emph{[binding]}, @emph{[entangle]}, grappling, @emph{[imprisonment]}, @emph{[maze]}, paralysis, petrification, pinning, @emph{[sleep]}, @emph{[slow]}, stunning, @emph{[temporal stasis]}, and @emph{[web]}. To free a creature from @emph{[imprisonment]}or @emph{[maze],}you must know its name and background, and you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or banished into the @emph{[maze]}.

Freedom of Movement

@strong{Freedom of Movement}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4, ranger 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a leather strip bound to the target), DF

@strong{Range} personal or touch

@strong{Target} you or creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, @emph{[solid fog]}, @emph{[slow]}, and @emph{[web]}. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The @emph{freedom of movement}spell does not, however, grant [water breathing].

Freezing Sphere

@strong{Freezing Sphere}

@strong{School} evocation [cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a small crystal sphere)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Target, Effect, or Area} see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous or 1 round/level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Freezing sphere}creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is [staggered] for 1d4 rounds.

If the @emph{freezing sphere}strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25 [Strength] check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at the end of which time the @emph{freezing sphere}bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a standard action.

@strong{Rage}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} one willing living creature per three levels, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} concentration + 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to [Strength] and [Constitution], a +1 morale bonus on [Will] saves, and a --2 penalty to [AC]. The effect is otherwise identical with a barbarian's rage except that the subjects aren't [fatigued] at the end of the rage.

Rainbow Pattern

@strong{Rainbow Pattern}

@strong{School} illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V (bard only), S, M (a piece of phosphor), F (a crystal prism); see text

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} Concentration +1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. @emph{Rainbow pattern}fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is [fascinated] by the pattern.

With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the @emph{rainbow pattern} move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All [fascinated] creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to remain within the effect. [Fascinated] creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each [fascinated] creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.

The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

Raise Dead

@strong{Raise Dead}

@strong{School}conjuration (healing); @strong{Level}cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time}1 minute

@strong{Components}V, S, M (diamond worth 5,000 gp), DF

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}dead creature touched

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}none, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes (harmless)

You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell gains two permanent [negative levels] when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be raised). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

Ray of Enfeeblement

@strong{Ray of Enfeeblement}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to [Strength] equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's [Strength] score cannot drop below 1. A successful [Fortitude] save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

Ray of Exhaustion

@strong{Ray of Exhaustion}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately [exhausted] for the spell's duration. A successful [Fortitude] save means the creature is only [fatigued].

A character that is already [fatigued] instead becomes [exhausted].

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [exhausted]. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.

Ray of Frost

@strong{Ray of Frost}

@strong{School} evocation [cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

Read Magic

@strong{Read Magic}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects---books, scrolls, weapons, and the like---that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of @emph{read magic.}You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a @emph{[glyph of warding]}with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a @emph{greater glyph of warding}with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any @emph{symbol}spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

@emph{Read magic}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Reduce Animal

@strong{Reduce Animal}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 2, ranger 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one willing animal of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge size

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell functions like @emph{[reduce person],}except that it affects a single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal's natural attacks as appropriate for its new size (see [Equipment] how to adjust damage for size).

Reduce Person

@strong{Reduce Person}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to [Dexterity], a --2 size penalty to [Strength] (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and [AC] due to its reduced size.

A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.

Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any @emph{reduced}item that leaves the @emph{reduced}creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. @emph{Reduce person}counters and dispels @emph{[enlarge person]}.

@emph{Reduce person}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Reduce Person, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[reduce person]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Refuge

@strong{Refuge}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a prepared object worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} object touched

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is so enhanced, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the subject).

You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and situation of the item possessor at the time the @emph{refuge}spell is discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you have no choice whether or not to be transported.

Regenerate

@strong{Regenerate}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 7, druid 9

@strong{Casting Time} 3 full rounds

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

@emph{Regenerate}also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect on nonliving creatures (including undead).

Reincarnate

@strong{Reincarnate}

@strong{School}transmutation; @strong{Level}druid 4

@strong{Casting Time}10 minutes

@strong{Components}V, S, M, DF (oils worth 1,000 gp)

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}dead creature touched

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}none, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes (harmless)

With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. [Strength], [Dexterity], and [Constitution] scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent [negative levels] when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.

For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table below. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.

A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.

You can free one or more creatures from the effects of temporary paralysis or related magic, including spells and effects that cause a creature to gain the [staggered] condition. If the spell is cast on one creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two creatures, each receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus against the effect that afflicts it. If cast on three or four creatures, each receives another save with a +2 resistance bonus.

The spell does not restore ability scores reduced by penalties, damage, or drain.

Repel Metal or Stone

@strong{Area} 60-ft. line from you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates waves of invisible energy that roll forth from you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects, small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.

Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back, dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal components are repelled, although an @emph{[antimagic field]}blocks the effects. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.

An invisible barrier holds back vermin. A vermin with HD of less than one-third your level cannot penetrate the barrier.

A vermin with HD of one-third your level or more can penetrate the barrier if it succeeds on a [Will] save. Even so, crossing the barrier deals the vermin 2d6 points of damage, and pressing against the barrier causes pain, which deters most vermin.

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the rate of 40 feet per round.

Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them along. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and drop it as a free action. If a spear is planted (set) in a way that prevents this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with wooden sections are repelled, although an @emph{[antimagic field]}blocks the effects.

The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's power.

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting (to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to an affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not forced back. The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still within the spell's area.

Resilient Sphere

@strong{Effect} 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a creature

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a @emph{[wall of force]}, except that it can be negated by @emph{[dispel magic]}. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

@strong{Duration} 1 minute

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves.

@emph{Resistance}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Resist Energy

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the [energy resistance] granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.

@emph{Resist energy}absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

@emph{Resist energy}overlaps (and does not stack with) @emph{[protection from energy].}If a character is warded by @emph{[protection from energy]}and @emph{resist energy,}the @emph{protection}spell absorbs damage until its power is [exhausted].

Restoration

@strong{Restoration}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 4, paladin 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp or 1,000 gp, see text)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser restoration],} except that it also dispels temporary [negative levels] or one permanent negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative level, it has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp. This spell cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent [negative level]possessed by a target in a 1-week period.

@emph{Restoration} cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

@strong{Restoration, Greater}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 7

@strong{Components} V, S, M (diamond dust 5,000 gp)

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser restoration],} except that it dispels all permanent and temporary [negative levels] afflicting the healed creature. @emph{Greater restoration} also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects.

@strong{Restoration, Lesser}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 3 rounds

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Lesser restoration}dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an [exhausted] condition to [fatigued]. It does not restore permanent ability drain.

Resurrection

@strong{Resurrection}

@strong{School}conjuration (healing); @strong{Level}cleric 7

@strong{Components}V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF

This spell functions like @emph{[raise dead],}except that you are able to restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.

The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a @emph{[disintegrate]}spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.

Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells. The subject of the spell gains one permanent [negative level]when it is raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be resurrected).

You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be resurrected.

Reverse Gravity

@strong{Reverse Gravity}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (lodestone and iron filings)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area can attempt a [Reflex] save to secure itself when the spell strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.

Righteous Might

@strong{Righteous Might}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to [Strength] and [Constitution] and take a --2 penalty to your [Dexterity]. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor. You gain [DR] 5/evil (if you normally channel positive energy) or [DR] 5/good (if you normally channel negative energy). At 15th level, this [DR] becomes 10/evil or 10/good (the maximum). Your size modifier for [AC] and attacks changes as appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn't change your speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and may make a [Strength] check (using your increased [Strength]) to burst any enclosures in the process (see [Additional Rules] for rules on breaking objects). If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you---the spell cannot crush you by increasing your size.

All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.

Rope Trick

@strong{Rope Trick}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered corn and a twisted loop of parchment)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched piece of rope from 5 ft. to 30 ft. long

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the usual multiverse of extradimensional spaces. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). The rope cannot be removed or hidden. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is [invisible], and even creatures that can see the window can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The @emph{rope trick}spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

Rusting Grasp

@strong{Rusting Grasp}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one nonmagical ferrous object (or the volume of the object within 3 ft. of the touched point) or one ferrous creature

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this spell.

You may employ @emph{rusting grasp}in combat with a successful melee touch attack. @emph{Rusting grasp}used in this way instantaneously destroys 1d6 points of [AC] gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of protection the armor offers) through corrosion.

Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must touch the weapon and not the other way around.

Against a ferrous creature, @emph{rusting grasp}instantaneously deals 3d6 points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one melee touch attack per round.

As player characters overcome challenges, they gain experience points. As these points accumulate, PCs advance in level and power. The rate of this advancement depends on the type of game that your group wants to play. Some prefer a fast-paced game, where characters gain levels every few sessions, while others prefer a game where advancement occurs less frequently. In the end, it is up to your group to decide what rate fits you best. Characters advance in level according to Table: Character Advancement and Level-Dependent Bonuses.

@node Advancing Your Character
@subsection Advancing Your Character
@anchor{#advancing-your-character}
A character advances in level as soon as he earns enough experience points to do so---typically, this occurs at the end of a game session, when your GM hands out that session's experience point awards.

The process of advancing a character works in much the same way as generating a character, except that your ability scores, race, and previous choices concerning class, skills, and feats cannot be changed. Adding a level generally gives you new abilities, additional skill points to spend, more hit points, and possibly an ability score increase or additional feat (see Table: Character Advancement and Level-Dependent Bonuses). Over time, as your character rises to higher levels, he becomes a truly powerful force in the game world, capable of ruling nations or bringing them to their knees.

When adding new levels of an existing class or adding levels of a new class (see Multiclassing, below), make sure to take the following steps in order. First, select your new class level. You must be able to qualify for this level before any of the following adjustments are made. Second, apply any ability score increases due to gaining a level. Third, integrate all of the level's class abilities and then roll for additional hit points. Finally, add new skills and feats. For more information on when you gain new feats and ability score increases, see Table: Character Advancement and Level-Dependent Bonuses.

@node Multiclassing
@subsection Multiclassing
@anchor{#multiclassing}
Instead of gaining the abilities granted by the next level in your character's current class, he can instead gain the 1st-level abilities of a new class, adding all of those abilities to his existing ones. This is known as “multiclassing.”

For example, let's say a 5th-level fighter decides to dabble in the arcane arts, and adds one level of wizard when he advances to 6th level. Such a character would have the powers and abilities of both a 5th-level fighter and a 1st-level wizard, but would still be considered a 6th-level character. (His class levels would be 5th and 1st, but his total character level is 6th.) He keeps all of his bonus feats gained from 5 levels of fighter, but can now also cast 1st-level spells and picks an arcane school. He adds all of the hit points, base attack bonuses, and saving throw bonuses from a 1st-level wizard on top of those gained from being a 5th-level fighter.

Note that there are a number of effects and prerequisites that rely on a character's level or Hit Dice. Such effects are always based on the total number of levels or Hit Dice a character possesses, not just those from one class. The exception to this is class abilities, most of which are based on the total number of class levels that a character possesses of that particular class.

@node Favored Class
@subsection Favored Class
@anchor{#favored-class}
Each character begins play with a single favored class of his choosing---typically, this is the same class as the one he chooses at 1st level. Whenever a character gains a level in his favored class, he receives either + 1 hit point or + 1 skill rank. The choice of favored class cannot be changed once the character is created, and the choice of gaining a hit point or a skill rank each time a character gains a level (including his first level) cannot be changed once made for a particular level. Prestige classes ) can never be a favored class.

@strong{Zone of Silence}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Area} 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

By casting @emph{zone of silence}, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a @emph{zone of silence.}

Zone of Truth

@strong{Zone of Truth}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 2, paladin 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.

@strong{Gaseous Form}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} S, M/DF (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}willing corporeal creature touched

@strong{Duration} 2 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, [Dexterity], deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains [DR] 10/magic and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the @emph{gaseous form}spell takes effect.

A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

Gate

@strong{Gate}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation or calling); @strong{Level} cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (see text)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Casting a @emph{gate}spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.

Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the @emph{gate.}

The @emph{gate}itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.

A @emph{gate}has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the @emph{gate}from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.

@emph{Planar Travel}: As a mode of planar travel, a @emph{gate}spell functions much like a @emph{[plane shift]}spell, except that the @emph{gate}opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a @emph{gate}from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you---anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A @emph{gate}cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.

You may hold the @emph{gate}open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.

@emph{Calling Creatures}: The second effect of the @emph{gate}spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the @emph{gate}to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the @emph{gate,}although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a @emph{gate}that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.

If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures. In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.

If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the @emph{[lesser planar ally]}spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in “livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.

Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.

@emph{Note}: When you use a calling spell such as @emph{gate}to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.

Geas/Quest

@strong{Geas, Lesser}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature with 7 HD or less

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level or until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{lesser geas}places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a @emph{geas}cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The @emph{geased}creature must follow the given instructions until the @emph{geas}is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the @emph{lesser geas}for 24 hours, it takes a --2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another --2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of --8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the @emph{lesser geas.}

A @emph{lesser geas}(and all ability score penalties) can be ended by @emph{[break enchantment]}, @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[remove curse]}, @emph{[miracle]}, or @emph{[wish]}. @emph{[Dispel magic]}does not affect a @emph{lesser geas}.

@strong{Geas/Quest}

@strong{School}enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level}bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time}10 minutes

@strong{Target}one living creature

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes

This spell functions similarly to @emph{lesser geas,}except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the @emph{geas/quest}for 24 hours, it takes a --3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another --3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of --12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the @emph{geas/quest.}

A @emph{[remove curse]}spell ends a @emph{geas/quest}spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. @emph{[Break enchantment]}does not end a @emph{geas/quest}, but @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[miracle]}, and @emph{[wish]}do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as @emph{geas,}while clerics call the same spell @emph{quest}.

Gentle Repose

@strong{Gentle Repose}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (salt and a copper piece for each of the corpse's eyes)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} corpse touched

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead (see @emph{[raise dead]}). Days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit. Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade less unpleasant.

The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

Ghost Sound

@strong{Ghost Sound}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a bit of wool or a small lump of wax)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} illusory sounds

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Ghost sound}allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound @emph{ghost sound}creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a @emph{ghost sound}spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a @emph{ghost sound} receives a [Will] save to disbelieve.

@emph{Ghost sound}can enhance the effectiveness of a @emph{[silent image]}spell.

@emph{Ghost sound}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Ghoul touch

@strong{Ghoul touch}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (cloth from a ghoul or earth from a ghoul's lair)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living humanoid touched

@strong{Duration} 1d6+2 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.

A [paralyzed] subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become [sickened] ([Fortitude] negates). A @emph{[neutralize poison]}spell removes the effect from a [sickened] creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.

Giant Form

@strong{Giant Form I}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to assume)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Large humanoid creature of the giant subtype. Once you assume your new form, you gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to [Strength], a --2 penalty to [Dexterity], a +4 size bonus to [Constitution], a +4 natural armor bonus, and [low-light vision]. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: [darkvision] 60 feet, rend (2d6 damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing (range 60 feet, 2d6 damage). If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.

@strong{Giant Form II}

@strong{School}Transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions as @emph{[giant form I]}except that it also allows you to assume the form of any Huge creature of the giant type. You gain the following abilities: a +8 size bonus to [Strength], a --2 penalty to [Dexterity], a +6 size bonus to [Constitution], a +6 natural armor bonus, [low-light vision], and a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your speed. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: swim 60 feet, [darkvision] 60 feet, rend (2d8 damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing (range 120 feet, 2d10 damage). If the creature has immunity or resistance to one element, you gain that immunity or resistance. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.

Giant Vermin

@strong{Giant Vermin}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 4, druid 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} 1 or more vermin, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.

Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“Attack,” “Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on Bluff checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. This bonus doesn't apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message via innuendo.

If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth.

Glitterdust

@strong{Glitterdust}

@strong{School}conjuration (creation); @strong{Level}bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (ground mica)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area}creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration}1 round/level

@strong{Save}[Will] negates (blinding only); @strong{SR}no

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become [blinded] and visibly outlining [invisible] things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn [blinded] creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a --40 penalty on Stealth checks.

Globe of Invulnerability

@strong{Globe of Invulnerability}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser globe of invulnerability],}except that it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.

@strong{Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)

@strong{Range} 10 ft.

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the @emph{[lesser globe of invulnerability]}. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a @emph{[dispel magic]}spell@emph{.}You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether @emph{[lesser globe of invulnerability]}stops it.

Glyph of Warding

@strong{Glyph of Warding}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target or Area} object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no (object) and yes; see text

This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A @emph{glyph of warding}can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.

You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to [invisible] creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.

When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.

Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. @emph{[Mislead]}, @emph{[polymorph]}, and @emph{[nondetection]}(and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. @emph{[Read magic]}allows you to identify a @emph{glyph of warding}with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{glyph of warding}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for @emph{glyph of warding}.

Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.

@emph{Blast Glyph}: A @emph{blast glyph}deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a [Reflex] save to take half damage. [Spell resistance] applies against this effect.

@emph{Spell Glyph}: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph@emph{.}If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and [spell resistance] operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.

@strong{Glyph of Warding, Greater}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 6

This spell functions like @emph{[glyph of warding],}except that a @emph{greater blast glyph}deals up to 10d8 points of damage, and a @emph{greater spell glyph}can store a spell of 6th level or lower.

@emph{[Read magic]} allows you to identify a @emph{greater glyph of warding} with a DC 16 Spellcraft check.

@emph{Material Component}: You trace the glyph with incense, which must first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 400 gp.

Goodberry

@strong{Goodberry}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} 2d4 fresh berries touched

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Casting @emph{goodberry}makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You (as well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures 1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such curing in any 24-hour period.

Good Hope

@strong{Good Hope}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3

@strong{Targets} one living creature/level, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell instills powerful hope in the subjects. Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

@emph{Good hope} counters and dispels @emph{[crushing despair].}

Grasping Hand

@strong{Grasping Hand}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as @emph{[interposing hand]}, except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The @emph{grasping hand} gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its [CMB] and [CMD] for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its [Strength] (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its [Dexterity] is 10, granting no bonus on the [Combat Maneuver Defense]). The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The @emph{grasping hand} can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as @emph{[interposing hand]} does.

A @emph{grease}spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful [Reflex] save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a [Reflex] save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered [flat-footed].

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a [Reflex] saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the @emph{greased}item. A creature wearing @emph{greased}armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their [CMD] to avoid being [grappled].

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell creates the following magical effects within the warded area.

@emph{Fog}: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including [darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Saving Throw: none. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

@emph{Arcane Locks}: All doors in the warded area are @emph{[arcane lock]ed.}Saving Throw: none. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

@emph{Webs}: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are identical with those created by the @emph{[web]}spell, except that they regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the @emph{guards and wards}spell lasts. Saving Throw: [Reflex] negates; see text for @emph{[web]}. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

@emph{Confusion}: Where there are choices in direction---such as a corridor intersection or side passage---a minor @emph{confusion-}type effect functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: yes.

@emph{Lost Doors}: One door per caster level is covered by a @emph{[silent image]}to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: [Will] disbelief (if interacted with). @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five magical effects.

​1. @emph{[Dancing lights]}in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the @emph{guards and wards}spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

​2. A @emph{[magic mouth]}in two places. Saving Throw: none. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

​3. A @emph{[stinking cloud]}in two places. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the @emph{guards and wards}spell lasts. Saving Throw: [Fortitude] negates; see text for @emph{[stinking cloud].}@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: no.

​4. A @emph{[gust of wind]}in one corridor or room. Saving Throw: [Fortitude] negates. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: yes.

​5. A @emph{[suggestion]}in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives the @emph{[suggestion]}mentally. Saving Throw: [Will] negates. @ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}: yes.

The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration school. A @emph{[dispel magic]}cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. A successful @emph{[mage's disjunction]}destroys the entire @emph{guards and wards}effect.

@strong{School} evocation [air]; @strong{Level} druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Effect} line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range

@strong{Duration} 1 round

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a --4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

Small creatures are knocked [prone] by the force of the wind.

Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 [Strength] check.

Large or larger creatures may move normally within a @emph{gust of wind}effect.

This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a --4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a @emph{gust of wind}.

The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a @emph{gust of wind}can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

@emph{Gust of wind}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@caption{Table: Random Magic Item Generation}
@end float
To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, though, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.

Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.

The four ways to activate magic items are described below.

@strong{Spell Completion}: This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that's left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can't already cast the spell, there's a chance he'll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action (or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer) and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.

@strong{Spell Trigger}: Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it's even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Spell trigger items can be used by anyone whose class can cast the corresponding spell. This is the case even for a character who can't actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin. The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Command Word}: If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.

A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.

The @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} (arcana) and @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue. The spells @emph{[detect magic], [identify],}and @emph{[analyze dweomer]}all reveal command words if the properties of the item are successfully identified.

@strong{Use Activated}: This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.

Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character's possession (meaning on his person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.

Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item's activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use, activation is not an action at all.

Use activation doesn't mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.
@menu
* Size and Magic Items::
@end menu

@node Size and Magic Items
@section Size and Magic Items
@anchor{#size-and-magic-items}
When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the time size shouldn't be an issue. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer. Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.

There may be rare exceptions, especially with race-specific items.

@strong{Armor and Weapon Sizes}: Armor and weapons that are found at random have a 30% chance of being Small (01--30), a 60% chance of being Medium (31--90), and a 10% chance of being any other size (91--100).

@node Magic Items on the Body
@chapter Magic Items on the Body
@anchor{#magic-items-on-the-body}
Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ them or benefit from their abilities. It's possible for a creature with a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 15 magic items at the same time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a particular part of the body, known as a “slot.”

A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which slot on the body the item is worn.

@strong{Armor}: suits of armor.

@strong{Belts}: belts and girdles.

@strong{Body}: robes and vestments.

@strong{Chest}: mantles, shirts, and vests.

@strong{Eyes}: eyes, glasses, and goggles.

@strong{Feet}: boots, shoes, and slippers.

@strong{Hands}: gauntlets and gloves.

@strong{Head}: circlets, crowns, hats, helms, and masks.

@strong{Headband}: headbands and phylacteries.

@strong{Neck}: amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, and scarabs.

@strong{Ring (up to two)}: rings.

@strong{Shield}: shields.

@strong{Shoulders}: capes and cloaks.

@strong{Wrist}: bracelets and bracers.

Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those in the slots listed above have no effect.

Some items can be worn or carried without taking up a slot on a character's body. The description of an item indicates when an item has this property.

@node Saving Throws Against Magic Item Powers
@chapter Saving Throws Against Magic Item Powers
@anchor{#saving-throws-against-magic-item-powers}
Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic item, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell.

Staves are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to save DCs.

Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects, particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).

@node Damaging Magic Items
@chapter Damaging Magic Items
@anchor{#damaging-magic-items}
A magic item doesn't need to make a saving throw unless it is unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving throw against spells that might deal damage to them---even against attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no matter what the type , [Reflex], or [Will]). A magic item's saving throw bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its caster level (rounded down). The only exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make [Will] saves based on their own [Wisdom] scores.

Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it is destroyed, all its magical power is lost. Magic items that take damage in excess of half their total hit points, but not more than their total hit points, gain the [broken] condition, and might not function properly.

Repairing a magic item requires material components equal to half the cost to create the item, and requires half the time. The @emph{[make whole]}spell can also repair a damaged (or even a destroyed) magic items---if the caster is high enough level.

@node Charges Doses and Multiple Uses
@section Charges, Doses, and Multiple Uses
@anchor{#charges-doses-and-multiple-uses}
Many items, particularly wands and staves, are limited in power by the number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most (10 for staves). If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left.

Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that's worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item's value is based on the number of charges left.

Magic items are valuable, and most major cities have at least one or two purveyors of magic items, from a simple potion merchant to a weapon smith that specializes in magic swords. Of course, not every item in this book is available in every town.

The following guidelines are presented to help GMs determine what items are available in a given community. These guidelines assume a setting with an average level of magic. Some cities might deviate wildly from these baselines, subject to GM discretion. The GM should keep a list of what items are available from each merchant and should replenish the stocks on occasion to represent new acquisitions.

The number and types of magic items available in a community depend upon its size. Each community has a base value associated with it (see Table: Available Magic Items). There is a 75% chance that any item of that value or lower can be found for sale with little effort in that community. In addition, the community has a number of other items for sale. These items are randomly determined and are broken down by category (minor, medium, or major). After determining the number of items available in each category, refer to Table: Random Magic Item Generation to determine the type of each item (potion, scroll, ring, weapon, etc.) before moving on to the individual charts to determine the exact item. Reroll any items that fall below the community's base value.

If you are running a campaign with low magic, reduce the base value and the number of items in each community by half. Campaigns with little or no magic might not have magic items for sale at all. GMs running these sorts of campaigns should make some adjustments to the challenges faced by the characters due to their lack of magic gear.

Campaigns with an abundance of magic items might have communities with twice the listed base value and random items available. Alternatively, all communities might count as one size category larger for the purposes of what items are available. In a campaign with very common magic, all magic items might be available for purchase in a metropolis.

Nonmagical items and gear are generally available in a community of any size unless the item is particularly expensive, such as full plate, or made of an unusual material, such as an [adamantine] longsword. These items should follow the base value guidelines to determine their availability, subject to GM discretion.

@node Magic Item Descriptions
@chapter Magic Item Descriptions
@anchor{#magic-item-descriptions}
Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.

General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The [AC], hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The [AC] assumes that the item is unattended and includes a --5 penalty for the item's effective [Dexterity] of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature's [Dexterity] modifier in place of the --5 penalty.

Some individual items, notably those that just store spells, don't get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell's description for details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it.

Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form as part of its entry.

@strong{Aura}: Most of the time, a @emph{[detect magic]}spell reveals the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item's notational entry. See the @emph{[detect magic]}spell description for details.

@strong{Caster Level (CL)}: The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item's saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a @emph{[dispel magic]}spell or similar situation.

For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell but not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself.

@strong{Slot}: Most magic items can only be utilized if worn or wielded in their proper slots. If the item is stowed or placed elsewhere, it does not function. If the slot lists “none,” the item must be held or otherwise carried to function.

@strong{Price}: This is the cost, in gold pieces, to purchase the item, if it is available for sale. Generally speaking, magic items can be sold by PCs for half this value.

@strong{Weight}: This is the weight of an item. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).

@strong{Description}: This section of a magic item describes the item's powers and abilities. Potions, scrolls, staves, and wands refer to various spells as part of their descriptions (see @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists} for details on these spells).

@strong{Construction}: With the exception of artifacts, most magic items can be built by a spellcaster with the appropriate feats and prerequisites. This section describes those prerequisites.

@strong{Requirements}: Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately following the item's caster level.

A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.

It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.

If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator's level must be known.

@strong{Cost}: This is the cost in gold pieces to create the item. Generally this cost is equal to half the price of an item, but additional material components might increase this number. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.

@node Dwarves
@chapter Dwarves
@anchor{#dwarves}
Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless craftsmen of the earth. It could be said that dwarven history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.

@strong{Physical Description}: Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. A clean-shaven male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse---no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarf.

@strong{Society}: The great distances between their mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within dwarven society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and a fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.

@strong{Relations}: Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity, theirs a history of violence as old as both their races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find halflings, elves, and gnomes to be too frail, flighty, or “pretty” to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition, and while they are often satirized as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that, while they work hard, they play even harder---especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.

@strong{Adventurers}: Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.

@chapter Elves
@anchor{#elves}
The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, yet different as well. Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends, at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, such alliances can last for generations. Elves have a curious attachment to their surroundings, perhaps as a result of their incredibly long lifespans or some deeper, more mystical reason. Elves who dwell in a region for long find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration reflecting the local environment. Those elves that spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes.

@strong{Physical Description}: Although generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, fragile physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves that live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashion.

@strong{Society}: Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer instead to indulge in the finer arts, with their inborn patience making them particularly suited to wizardry.

@strong{Relations}: Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet they are excellent judges of character. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge that dwarf's skill at smithing. They regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, and halflings with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world, even if they usually disown such offspring. They regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good.

@strong{Adventurers}: Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded forest realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their forefathers. For those raised among humans, the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds natural appeal. Elves generally eschew melee because of their frailty, preferring instead to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.

@node Gnomes
@chapter Gnomes
@anchor{#gnomes}
Gnomes trace their lineage back to the mysterious realm of the fey, a place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to mortal culture. As a result, gnomes are widely regarded by the other races as alien and strange.

@strong{Physical Description}: Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, frequently with little regard for heredity. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual.

@strong{Society}: Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Whimsical creatures at heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring relationships among themselves or with members of other races, instead pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that borders on zealotry. Male gnomes have a strange fondness for unusual hats and headgear, while females often proudly wear elaborate and eccentric hairstyles.

@strong{Relations}: Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other races, on both emotional and physical levels. Gnome humor is hard to translate and often comes across as malicious or senseless to other races, while gnomes in turn tend to think of the taller races as dull and lumbering giants. They get along well with halflings and humans, but are overly fond of playing jokes on dwarves and half-orcs, whom most gnomes feel need to lighten up. They respect elves, but often grow frustrated with the comparatively slow pace at which members of the long-lived race make decisions. To the gnomes, action is always better than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest periods.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters, with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their hearts are generally in the right place. They are prone to powerful fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural world.

@strong{Adventurers}: Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust makes them natural adventurers. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing adventurers. Gnomes make up for their weakness with a proclivity for sorcery or bardic music.

@node Half-elves
@chapter Half-elves
@anchor{#half-elves}
Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous life spans, magical affinity, and inherent grace each contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all their traits, however, none so entrance their human associates as their beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other, the humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in the fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play out their brief lives.

Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually short-lived, even by human standards, these trysts commonly lead to the birth of half-elves, a race descended of two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these “pureblood” half-elves tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves alike.

@strong{Physical Description}: Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. A half-elf's human-like eyes tend to range a spectrum of exotic colors running from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue.

@strong{Society}: The lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often attractive to both races for the same reasons as their parents, half-elves rarely fit in with either humans or elves, as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mindsets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in.

@strong{Relations}: A half-elf understands loneliness, and knows that character is often less a product of race than of life experience. As such, half-elves are often open to friendships and alliances with other races, and less likely to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Half-elves' isolation strongly influences their characters and philosophies. Cruelty does not come naturally to them, nor does blending in and bending to societal convention---as a result, most half-elves are chaotic good. Half-elves' lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland.

@strong{Adventurers}: Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove oneself to the community and establish a personal identity---or even a legacy---drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery.

@node Half-orcs
@chapter Half-orcs
@anchor{#half-orcs}
Half-orcs are monstrosities, their tragic births the result of perversion and violence---or at least, that's how other races see them. It's true that half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Feared, distrusted, and spat upon, half-orcs still consistently manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom---though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls.

@strong{Physical Description}: Both genders of half-orc stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canines often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these “tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful.

@strong{Society}: Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by the legions of humans who don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Still, while not exactly accepted, half-orcs in civilized societies tend to be valued for their martial prowess, and orc leaders have actually been known to spawn them intentionally, as the halfbreeds regularly make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural chieftains and strategic advisors.

@strong{Relations}: A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet those who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Elves and dwarves tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, but other races aren't much more understanding. Human societies with few orc problems tend to be the most accommodating, and there half-orcs make natural mercenaries and enforcers.

@strong{Alignment & Religion}: Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature---rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves.

@strong{Adventurers}: Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world.

@node Halflings
@chapter Halflings
@anchor{#halflings}
Optimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck and driven by a powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easy-going, halflings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on opportunity, and are not as prone as some of the more volatile races to violent or emotional outbursts. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, a halfling almost never loses his sense of humor.

Halflings are inveterate opportunists. Unable to physically defend themselves from the rigors of the world, they know when to bend with the wind and when to hide away. Yet a halfling's curiosity often overwhelms his good sense, leading to poor decisions and narrow escapes.

Though their curiosity drives them to travel and seek new places and experiences, halflings possess a strong sense of house and home, often spending above their means to enhance the comforts of home life.

@strong{Physical Description}: Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading to the bottoms of their feet being roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Their skin tends toward a rich almond color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling's ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.

@strong{Society}: Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Far more often, they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives on the road, traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer.

@strong{Relations}: A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go unnoticed by other races---it is this trait that allows so many halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings, knowing full well the stereotyped view other races take of them as a result, go out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger races when they're not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings coexist well with humans as a general rule, but since some of the more aggressive human societies value halflings as slaves, halflings try not to grow too complacent when dealing with them. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but these races generally live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for interaction. Only half-orcs are generally shunned by halflings, for their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for most halflings to cope with.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Halflings are loyal to their friends and families, but since they dwell in a world dominated by races twice as large as themselves, they've come to grips with the fact that sometimes they'll need to scrap and scrounge for survival. Most halflings are neutral as a result.

@strong{Adventurers}: Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal for lives of adventure. Other such vagabonds tend to put up with the curious race in hopes that some of their mystical luck will rub off.

@node Humans
@chapter Humans
@anchor{#humans}
Humans possess exceptional drive and a great capacity to endure and expand, and as such are currently the dominant race in the world. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and the citizens of these societies carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is best characterized by its tumultuousness and diversity, and human cultures run the gamut from savage but honorable tribes to decadent, devil-worshiping noble families in the most cosmopolitan cities. Human curiosity and ambition often triumph over their predilection for a sedentary lifestyle, and many leave their homes to explore the innumerable forgotten corners of the world or lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors, simply because they can.

@strong{Physical Description}: The physical characteristics of humans are as varied as the world's climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, humans' skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live.

@strong{Society}: Human society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of common races like elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, ingenuity, and ambition.

@strong{Relations}: Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases, this leads to violence and war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with races who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and half-orcs as embarrassments---but the race's diversity among its own members also makes humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are.

@strong{Alignment and Religion}: Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the common races, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some assemble into vast barbaric hordes, while others build sprawling cities that cover miles. Taken as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they generally tend to congregate in nations and civilizations with specific alignments. Humans also have the widest range in gods and religion, lacking other races' ties to tradition and eager to turn to anyone offering them glory or protection.

@strong{Adventurers}: Ambition alone drives countless humans, and for many, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether it be wealth, acclaim, social status, or arcane knowledge. A few pursue adventuring careers simply for the thrill of danger. Humans hail from myriad regions and backgrounds, and as such can fill any role within an adventuring party.

@strong{Names}: Unlike other races, who generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of a northern barbarian tribe have much different names than those hailing from a subtropical nation of sailors and tradesmen. Throughout most of the world humans speak Common, yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.

@strong{Call Lightning}

@strong{School} evocation [electricity]; @strong{Level} druid 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} one or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.

You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).

If you are outdoors and in a stormy area---a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)---each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.

This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.

@strong{Targets} animals within 30 ft. of each other

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with [Intelligence] scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not [helpless] and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

Calm Emotions

@strong{Calm Emotions}

@strong{School}enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but @emph{calm emotions}can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as @emph{[bless], [good hope],}and @emph{[rage],}and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the @emph{[confused]}condition from all targets@emph{.}While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the @emph{calm emotions}spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Cat's Grace

@strong{Cat's Grace}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Dexterity], adding the usual benefits to [AC], [Reflex] saves, and other uses of the [Dexterity] modifier.

@strong{Cat's Grace, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[cat's grace]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Cause Fear

@strong{Cause Fear}

@strong{School} necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature with 5 or fewer HD

@strong{Duration} 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The affected creature becomes [frightened]. If the subject succeeds on a [Will] save, it is [shaken] for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more HD are immune to this effect. @emph{Cause fear}counters and dispels @emph{remove fear}.

Chain Lightning

@strong{Chain Lightning}

@strong{School} evocation [electricity]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; plus one silver pin per caster level)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} one primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike @emph{[lightning bolt]}, @emph{chain lightning}strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.

The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.

Each target can attempt a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage. The [Reflex] DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

Changestaff

@strong{Changestaff}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a quarterstaff that has been carved and polished for 28 days)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} your touched staff

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

Chaos Hammer

@strong{Chaos Hammer}

@strong{School} evocation [chaotic]; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds * spell). A successful [Will] save reduces the damage by half and negates the [slow] effect.

The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful [Will] save.

Charm Animal

@strong{Charm Animal}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Target} one animal

This spell functions like @emph{charm person}, except that it affects a creature of the animal type.

Charm Monster

@strong{Charm Monster}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

This spell functions like @emph{charm person}, except that the effect is not restricted by creature type or size.

@strong{Charm Monster, Mass}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Targets} One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

This spell functions like @emph{[charm monster],}except that @emph{mass charm monster}affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you must choose a creature with too many HD to affect.

Charm Person

@strong{Charm Person}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed [Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

Chill Metal

@strong{Chill Metal}

@strong{School} transmutation [cold]; @strong{Level} druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target}metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of metal/level, none of which can be more than 30 ft. away from any of the rest

@strong{Duration} 7 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

@emph{Chill metal}makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.

@multitable {Round} {Metal Temperature} {1d4 points} 
@headitem

@end multitable

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, @emph{chill metal}deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if unattended.

@emph{Chill metal}counters and dispels @emph{[heat metal]}.

Chill Touch

@strong{Chill Touch}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} creature or creatures touched (up to one/level)

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial or [Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of [Strength] damage unless it makes a successful [Fortitude] saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful [Will] saving throw or flee as if [panicked] for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

Circle of Death

@strong{Circle of Death}

@strong{School} necromancy [death]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a crushed black pearl worth 500 gp)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Circle of death}snuffs out the life force of living creatures, killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Clairaudience/Clairvoyance

@strong{Clairaudience/Clairvoyance}

@strong{School} divination (scrying); @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a small horn or a glass eye)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}magical sensor

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Clairaudience/clairvoyance}creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known---a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect. @emph{Clairaudience/clairvoyance}functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.

Clenched Fist

@strong{Clenched Fist}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a leather glove)

This spell functions like @emph{[interposing hand],}except that the hand can also push or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack [invisible] or concealed creatures is no better than yours.

The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your [Intelligence], [Wisdom], or [Charisma] modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively) + 11 for the hand's [Strength] score (33), -- 1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a [Fortitude] save (against this spell's save DC) or be [stunned] for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The @emph{clenched fist}can also interpose itself as @emph{[interposing hand]}does, or it can bull rush an opponent as @emph{[forceful hand]}does. Its [CMB] for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +11 bonus for its [Strength] score and a +1 bonus for being Large.

Cloak of Chaos

@strong{Cloak of Chaos}

@strong{School} abjuration [chaotic]; @strong{Level} cleric 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

@strong{Range} 20 ft.

@strong{Targets} one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become @emph{[confused].}This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike @emph{[protection from law]}, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as @emph{[protection from law]}does.

Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is @emph{[confused]}for 1 round ([Will] save negates, as with the @emph{[confusion]}spell, but against the save DC of @emph{cloak of chaos}).

Clone

@strong{Clone}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (laboratory supplies worth 1,000 gp), F (special laboratory equipment costing 500 gp)

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} one clone

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.

To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.

When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical to the original and possesses the same personality and memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining of two permanent [negative levels], just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent [negative levels] since the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these [negative levels] as well.

The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.

Cloudkill

@strong{Cloudkill}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a @emph{[fog cloud],}except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a [Fortitude] save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of [Constitution] damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).

A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of [Constitution] damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful [Fortitude] save halves this damage). Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.

Unlike a @emph{[fog cloud]}, the @emph{cloudkill}moves away from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.

Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where you cast the spell.

Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Color Spray

@strong{Color Spray}

@strong{School} illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (red, yellow, and blue powder or colored sand)

@strong{Range} 15 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become [stunned], perhaps also [blinded], and possibly knocking them [unconscious]. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

@emph{2 HD or less}: The creature is [unconscious], [blinded], and [stunned] for 2d4 rounds, then [blinded] and [stunned] for 1d4 rounds, and then [stunned] for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked [unconscious].)

@emph{3 or 4 HD}: The creature is [blinded] and [stunned] for 1d4 rounds, then [stunned] for 1 round.

@emph{5 or more HD}: The creature is [stunned] for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by @emph{color spray}.

Command

@strong{Command}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} 1 round

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

@emph{Approach}: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

@emph{Drop}: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

@emph{Fall}: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains [prone] for 1 round. It may act normally while [prone] but takes any appropriate penalties.

@emph{Flee}: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

@emph{Halt}: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered [helpless].

If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

@strong{Command, Greater}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

This spell functions like @emph{[command],}except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another [Will] save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.

Command Plants

@strong{Command Plants}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 4, ranger 3

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed [Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or HD do not exceed twice your level.

Command Undead

@strong{Command Undead}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a shred of raw meat and a splinter of bone)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one undead creature

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature. If the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed [Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its [Intelligence]) breaks the spell.

Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.

Commune

@strong{Commune}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (holy or unholy water and incense worth 500 gp), DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

You contact your deity---or agents thereof---and ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. “Unclear” is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

Commune with Nature

@strong{Commune with Nature}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} druid 5, ranger 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting.

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings---caves, caverns, and the like---the spell is less powerful, and its radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

Comprehend Languages

@strong{Comprehend Languages}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (pinch of soot and salt)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the @emph{[secret page]}and @emph{[illusory script]}spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

@emph{Comprehend languages}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Cone of Cold

@strong{Cone of Cold}

@strong{School} evocation [cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Cone of cold}creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

Confusion

@strong{Confusion}

@strong{School}enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level}bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M/DF (three nutshells)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets}all creatures in a 15-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration}1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes confusion in the targets@emph{,}making them unable to determine their actions. Roll on the following table at the start of each subject's turn each round to see what it does in that round.

@multitable {76--100} {Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self)} 
@headitem

@item

 @tab Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self)
@end multitable

A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

@strong{Confusion, Lesser}

Consecrate

@strong{Consecrate}

@strong{School} evocation [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of silver dust), DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor disruption, suffering a --1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to positive channeled energy DCs, --2 penalties for undead in the area).

You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity other than your own patron. Instead, the @emph{consecrate}spell curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

@emph{Consecrate}counters and dispels @emph{[desecrate]}.

Contact Other Plane

@strong{Contact Other Plane}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} concentration

You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. See the accompanying table for possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels.

Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in [Intelligence] and [Charisma] due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions, this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

@emph{Avoid Int/[Cha] Decrease}: You must succeed on an [Intelligence] check against this DC to avoid a decrease in [Intelligence] and [Charisma]. If the check fails, your [Intelligence] and [Charisma] scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. You cannot take 10 on this check. If you lose [Intelligence] and [Charisma], the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain.

@emph{True Answer}: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.

@emph{Don't Know}: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.

@emph{Lie}: The entity intentionally lies to you.

@emph{Random Answer}: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up.

The subject contracts one of the following diseases: [blinding sickness], [bubonic plague], [cackle fever], [filth fever], [leprosy], [mindfire], [red ache], [shakes], or [slimy doom]. The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects.

Contingency

@strong{Contingency}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} at least 10 minutes; see text

@strong{Components} V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting @emph{contingency}. The @emph{contingency}spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast @emph{contingency.}

The spell to be brought into effect by the @emph{contingency}must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the @emph{contingency}immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (@emph{contingency}and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

You can use only one @emph{contingency}spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

Continual Flame

@strong{Continual Flame}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} object touched

@strong{Effect}magical, heatless flame

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A @emph{continual flame}can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.

Light spells counter and dispel [darkness] spells of an equal or lower level.

Control Plants

@strong{Control Plants}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.

Control Undead

@strong{Control Undead}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a piece of bone and a piece of raw meat)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} up to 2 HD/level of undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

[Int]elligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek revenge after the spell's effects end.

Control Water

@strong{Control Water}

@strong{School} transmutation [water]; @strong{Level} cleric 4, druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a pinch of dust for @emph{lower water or}a drop of water for @emph{raise water})

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area}water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2 ft./level (S)

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell has two different applications, both of which control water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding nearby areas.

@emph{Lower Water}: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides are up to caster level × 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a @emph{[slow]}spell ([Will] negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.

@emph{Raise Water}: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in height, just as the @emph{lower water}version causes it to lower. Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change the overall area of effect.

Control Weather

@strong{Control Weather}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 7, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes; see text

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 2 miles

@strong{Area} 2-mile-radius circle, centered on you; see text

@strong{Duration} 4d12 hours; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. You can also use this spell to cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season.

@multitable {Late winter} {Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather}

@end multitable

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific applications of the weather---where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

@emph{Control weather}can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle with a 3-mile radius.

Control Winds

@strong{Control Winds}

@strong{School} transmutation [air]; @strong{Level} druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 40 ft./level

@strong{Area} 40 ft./level radius cylinder 40 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.

@emph{Wind Direction}: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to function over the spell's area.

@itemize
@item
A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all directions.
@item
An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before impinging on the eye in the center.
@item
Rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.
@item
A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across the entire area from one side to the other.
@end itemize

@emph{Wind Strength}: For every three caster levels, you can increase or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a creature in the wind must make a [Fortitude] save or suffer the effect of being in the windy area. See [Environment] for more details.

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.

A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.

A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off roofs, and endangers ships.

Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, uproot large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often uproots large trees.

Create Food and Water

@strong{Create Food and Water}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} food and water to sustain three humans or one horse/level for 24 hours

@strong{Duration} 24 hours; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice---highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a @emph{purify food and water}spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.

Create Greater Undead

@strong{Create Greater Undead}

@strong{School} necromancy [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions like @emph{[create undead],} except that you can create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows, wraiths, spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead created is based on caster level, as shown below.

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a clay pot filled with grave dirt and an onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one corpse

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A much more potent spell than @emph{[animate dead],}this evil spell allows you to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.

Create Water

@strong{Create Water}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [water]; @strong{Level} cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} up to 2 gallons of water/level

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large---possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles. This water disappears after 1 day if not consumed.

@emph{Note}: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

Creeping Doom

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Effect}four swarms of insects

@strong{Duration}1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make saves once.

You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of the swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area (but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).

Crushing Despair

@strong{Crushing Despair}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M

@strong{Range} 30 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the subjects. Each affected creature takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

@emph{Crushing despair} counters and dispels @emph{[good hope]}.

Crushing Hand

@strong{Crushing Hand}

@strong{School}evocation [force]; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions as @emph{[interposing hand]}, except that it can also grapple one opponent as @emph{[grasping hand]}. Its [CMB] and [CMD] for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its [Strength] score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its [Dexterity] is 10, granting no bonus to the [CMD]). A @emph{crushing hand}deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The @emph{crushing hand} can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as @emph{[forceful hand]}), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as @emph{[interposing hand]} does.

Cure Critical Wounds

@strong{Cure Critical Wounds}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 4, cleric 4, druid 5

This spell functions like @emph{[cure light wounds]}, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

@strong{Cure Critical Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 8, druid 9

This spell functions like @emph{mass cure light wounds}, except that it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +40).

Cure Light Wounds

@strong{Cure Light Wounds}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1, ranger 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] half (harmless); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless); see text

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply [spell resistance], and can attempt a [Will] save to take half damage.

@strong{Cure Light Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 5, cleric 5, druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] half (harmless) or [Will] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless) or yes; see text

You channel positive energy to cure 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) on each selected creature. Like other @emph{cure}spells, @emph{mass cure light wounds}deals damage to undead in its area rather than curing them. Each affected undead may attempt a [Will] save for half damage.

Cure Moderate Wounds

@strong{Cure Moderate Wounds}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2, druid 3, paladin 3, ranger 3

This spell functions like @emph{[cure light wounds]}, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

@strong{Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 6, cleric 6, druid 7

This spell functions like @emph{mass cure light wounds}, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +30).

Cure Serious Wounds

@strong{Cure Serious Wounds}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 4, ranger 4

This spell functions like @emph{[cure light wounds]}, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15).

@strong{Cure Serious Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 7, druid 8

This spell functions like @emph{mass cure light wounds}, except that it cures 3d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +35).

Curse Water

@strong{Curse Water}

@strong{School} necromancy [evil];@strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (5 lbs. of powdered silver worth 25 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} flask of water touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with negative energy, turning it into unholy water (see [Equipment]). Unholy water damages good outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders.

@node Feats
@chapter Feats
@anchor{#feats}
Some abilities are not tied to your race, class, or skill---things like particularly quick reflexes that allow you to react to danger more swiftly, the ability to craft magic items, the training to deliver powerful strikes with melee weapons, or the knack for deflecting arrows fired at you. These abilities are represented as feats. While some feats are more useful to certain types of characters than others, and many of them have special prerequisites that must be met before they are selected, as a general rule feats represent abilities outside of the normal scope of your character's race and class. Many of them alter or enhance class abilities or soften class restrictions, while others might apply bonuses to your statistics or grant you the ability to take actions otherwise prohibited to you. By selecting feats, you can customize and adapt your character to be uniquely yours.

@node Prerequisites
@chapter Prerequisites
@anchor{#prerequisites}
Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he gains the prerequisite.

A character can't use a feat if he loses a prerequisite, but he does not lose the feat itself. If, at a later time, he regains the lost prerequisite, he immediately regains full use of the feat that prerequisite enables.

@node Types of Feats
@chapter Types of Feats
@anchor{#types-of-feats}
Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow characters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were of a higher spell level than it actually is.

An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of item each involves, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.

@strong{Raw Materials Cost}: The cost of creating a magic item equals half the base price of the item.

Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he needs unless unusual circumstances apply.

@strong{Time}: The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item.

@strong{Item Cost}: [Brew Potion], [Craft Staff], [Craft Wand], and [Scribe Scroll] create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level---that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:

@strong{@emph{Scrolls:} Base price = spell level × caster level × 25 gp.}@* @strong{@emph{Potions:} Base price = spell level × caster level × 50 gp.}@* @strong{@emph{Wands:} Base price = spell level × caster level × 750 gp.}@* @emph{*}Staves:* The price for staves is calculated using more *@strong{complex formulas ).}

A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.

@strong{Extra Costs}: Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend 50 units of the material component. Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.

@strong{Skill Check}: Successfully creating a magic item requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 5 + the item's caster level. Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See [Magic Item Creation] for more details on which Craft and Profession checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item. See [Magic Items] for more details.

@node [Metamagic Feats]
@section [Metamagic Feats]
@anchor{#metamagic-feats}
As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic feats do not affect spell-like abilities.

@strong{Wizards and Divine Spellcasters}: Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).

@strong{Sorcerers and Bards}: Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the feat.

For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.

@strong{Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats}: A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a @emph{summon nature's ally}spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.

@strong{Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell}: In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast using a higher-level spell slot. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.

The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.

Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. Casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.

@strong{Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell}: A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

@strong{Magic Items and Metamagic Spells}: With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.

@strong{Counterspelling Metamagic Spells}: Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell ).

Feats are summarized on Table: Feats below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats description for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

@strong{Feat Name}: The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.

@strong{Prerequisite}: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.

@strong{Benefit}: What the feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

@strong{Normal:} What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

@strong{Special:} Additional unusual facts about the feat.

@* You attract followers to your cause and a companion to join you on your adventures.

@strong{Prerequisite:} Character level 7th.

@strong{Benefits:} This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table: Leadership for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit.

@strong{Leadership Modifiers:} Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score

modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score:

@* Leader's Reputation Modifier ------------------------- ---------- Great renown +2 Fairness and generosity +1 Special power +1 Failure --1 Aloofness --1 Cruelty --2

@* Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below.

@* The Leader...

Modifier

Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion

--2

Recruits a cohort of a different alignment

--1

Caused the death of a cohort

--2*

* Cumulative per cohort killed.

@* Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.

@* The Leader... Modifier -------------------------------------------------------- ---------- Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. +2 Moves around a lot --1 Caused the death of other followers --1

@* @emph{Leadership Score}: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your [Charisma] modifier. In order to take into account negative [Charisma] modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above.

@emph{Cohort Level}: You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see @ref{#creating-npcs,Creating NPCs}). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a --1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.@* A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.

If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level---its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.

@emph{Number of Followers by Level}: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat.

Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.

@strong{Prerequisites:} [Str] 13, base attack bonus +1.

@strong{Benefit:} You can choose to take a --1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (--50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by --1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2.

Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.

@strong{Normal:} Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.

@node Quicken Spell Metamagic
@section Quicken Spell (Metamagic)
@anchor{#quicken-spell-metamagic}
You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.

@strong{Benefit:} Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.

A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

@strong{Special:} You can apply the effects of this feat to a spell cast spontaneously, so long as it has a casting time that is not more than 1 full-round action, without increasing the spell's casting time.

@node Rapid Reload Combat
@section Rapid Reload (Combat)
@anchor{#rapid-reload-combat}

@strong{Prerequisite:} Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).

@strong{Benefit:} The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.

If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

@strong{Normal:} A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.

@section Scribe Scroll (Item Creation)
@anchor{#scribe-scroll-item-creation}
You can create magic scrolls.

@strong{Prerequisites:} [Critical Focus], [Staggering Critical], base attack bonus +17.

@strong{Benefit:} You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a [Fortitude] saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your [Wis] modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is [stunned] for 1 round (until just before your next turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions, loses any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], and takes a --2 penalty to [AC]. You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, [incorporeal] creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be [stunned].

@strong{Special:} A monk receives Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a stunning attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

These extra weapon damage dice are not multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total.

@node Weapon Finesse Combat
@section Weapon Finesse (Combat)
@anchor{#weapon-finesse-combat}
You are trained in using your agility in melee combat, as opposed to brute strength.

@strong{Benefit:} With a light weapon, rapier, whip, or spiked chain made for a creature of your size category, you may use your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.

@strong{Prerequisites:} [Dex] 13, [Int] 13, [Combat Expertise], [Dodge], [Mobility], [Spring Attack], base attack bonus +4.

@strong{Hallow}

@strong{School} evocation [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 24 hours

@strong{Components} V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the @emph{hallowed}area), DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Area} 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

@emph{Hallow}makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site. This has four major effects.

First, the site is warded by a @emph{[magic circle against evil]}effect.

Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced by 4. [Spell resistance] does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.

Third, any dead body interred in a @emph{hallowed}site cannot be turned into an undead creature.

Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the @emph{hallowed}site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting @emph{hallow}again.

Spell effects that may be tied to a @emph{hallowed}site include @emph{[aid], [bane], [bless], [cause fear], [darkness], [daylight], [death ward], [deeper darkness], [detect evil], [detect magic], [dimensional anchor], [discern lies], [dispel magic], [endure elements], [freedom of movement], [invisibility purge], [protection from energy], [remove fear], [resist energy], [silence], [tongues],}and @emph{[zone of truth]}. Saving throws and [spell resistance] might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)

An area can receive only one @emph{hallow}spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time. @emph{Hallow}counters but does not dispel @emph{[unhallow]}.

Hallucinatory Terrain

@strong{Hallucinatory Terrain}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a green leaf)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} one 30-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

Halt Undead

@strong{Halt Undead}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (see text); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of @emph{[hold person]}on a living creature). The effect is broken if the @emph{halted}creatures are attacked or take damage.

Harm

@strong{Harm}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Harm}charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If the creature successfully saves, @emph{harm}deals half this amount. @emph{Harm} cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.

If used on an undead creature, @emph{harm}acts like @emph{[heal]}.

Haste

@strong{Haste}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a @emph{speed} weapon, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC] and [Reflex] saves. Any condition that makes you lose your [Dexterity] bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} (if any) also makes you lose [dodge bonus]es.

All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple @emph{haste}effects don't stack. @emph{Haste}dispels and counters @emph{[slow].}

Heal

@strong{Heal}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 6, druid 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Heal}enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, [blinded], [confused]@emph{,}[dazed], [dazzled], [deafened], diseased, [exhausted], [fatigued], [feeblemind]ed@emph{,}[insanity], [nauseated], poisoned, [sickened], and [stunned]. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

@emph{Heal}does not remove [negative levels] or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, @emph{heal}instead acts like @emph{[harm]}.

@strong{Heal, Mass}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} cleric 9

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[heal],}except as noted above. The maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is 250.

Heal Mount

@strong{Heal Mount}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} paladin 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} your mount touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell functions like @emph{[heal],}but it affects only the paladin's special mount (typically a horse).

Heat Metal

@strong{Heat Metal}

@strong{School} transmutation [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target}metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of metal/level, all of which must be within a 30-ft. circle

@strong{Duration} 7 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

@emph{Heat metal}causes metal objects to become red-hot. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.

@multitable {Round} {Metal Temperature} {1d4 points} 
@headitem

Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. If cast underwater, @emph{heat metal}deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

@emph{Heat metal}counters and dispels @emph{[chill metal]}.

Helping Hand

@strong{Helping Hand}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 5 miles

@strong{Effect} ghostly hand

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.

When the spell is cast, you specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.

@multitable {100 ft. or less} {Time to Locate} 
@headitem 
Distance
 @tab Time to Locate
@item 
100 ft. or less
 @tab 1 round
@item 
1,000 ft.
 @tab 1 minute
@item 
1 mile
 @tab 10 minutes
@item 
2 miles
 @tab 1 hour
@item 
3 miles
 @tab 2 hours
@item 
4 miles
 @tab 3 hours
@item 
5 miles
 @tab 4 hours
@end multitable

Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.

The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to locate you.

If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.

If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.

The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is [invisible] to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

Heroes' Feast

@strong{Heroes' Feast}

@strong{School}conjuration [creation]; @strong{Level}bard 6, cleric 6

@strong{Casting Time}10 minutes

@strong{Components}V, S, DF

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect}feast for one creature/level

@strong{Duration}1 hour plus 12 hours; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every creature partaking of the feast is cured of all sickness and nausea, receives the benefits of both @emph{[neutralize poison]} and @emph{[remove disease]}, and gains 1d8 temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial food grants each creature that partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and [Will] saves and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours.

If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.

Heroism

@strong{Heroism}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.

@strong{Heroism, Greater}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

This spell functions like @emph{[heroism],}except the creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum 20).

Hide from Animals

@strong{Hide from Animals}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} one creature touched/level

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as [blindsense], [blindsight], [scent], and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

Hide from Undead

@strong{Hide from Undead}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} one touched creature/level

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this spell. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as [blindsense], [blindsight], [scent], and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures (such as skeletons or zombies) are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a single [Will] saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of the warded creatures. If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, however, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded creature attempts to channel positive energy, turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a spell), the spell ends for all recipients.

Hideous Laughter

@strong{Hideous Laughter}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (tiny fruit tarts and a feather)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature; see text

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling [prone]. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered [helpless]. After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration.

A creature with an [Intelligence] score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't “translate” well.

Hold Animal

@strong{Hold Animal}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} druid 2, ranger 2

@strong{Components}: V, S

@strong{Components}: V, S, M/DF (one hard metal bar or rod, which can be as small as a three-penny nail)

@strong{Target} one living creature

This spell functions like @emph{[hold person],}except that it affects any living creature that fails its [Will] save.

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D); see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The subject becomes [paralyzed] and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature who is [paralyzed] cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.

@strong{Hold Person, Mass}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Component}V

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one portal, up to 20 sq. ft./level

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A @emph{[knock]}spell or a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}spell can negate a @emph{hold portal}spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.

Holy Aura

@strong{Holy Aura}

@strong{School} abjuration [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 8

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become [blinded] when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike @emph{[protection from evil]}, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as @emph{[protection from evil]}does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a @emph{holy aura}, the offending attacker is [blinded] ([Fortitude] save negates, as @emph{[blindness/deafness]}, but against @emph{holy aura's}save DC).

Holy Smite

@strong{Holy Smite}

@strong{School} evocation [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous (1 round); see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become [blinded] for 1 round. A successful [Will] saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the [blinded] effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not [blinded]. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful [Will] save.

Holy Sword

@strong{Holy Sword}

@strong{School} evocation [good]; @strong{Level} paladin 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}melee weapon touched

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a @emph{+5 holy weapon}(+5 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against evil opponents). It also emits a @emph{[magic circle against evil]}effect (as the spell). If the @emph{magic circle}ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one @emph{holy sword}at a time.

If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supercede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with @emph{bless weapon}or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

Holy Word

@strong{Holy Word}

@strong{School} evocation [good, sonic]; @strong{Level} cleric 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} 40 ft.

@strong{Area} nongood creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any nongood creature within the area of a @emph{holy word}spell suffers the following ill effects.

@multitable {Up to caster level --10} {Killed, [paralyzed], [blinded], [deafened]} 
@headitem 
HD
 @tab Effect
@item 
Equal to caster level
 @tab [Deafened]

Up to caster level --1
 @tab [Blinded], [deafened]

Up to caster level --5
 @tab [Paralyzed], [blinded], [deafened]
@item 
Up to caster level --10
 @tab Killed, [paralyzed], [blinded], [deafened]
@end multitable

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

@emph{Deafened}: The creature is [deafened] for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.

@emph{Blinded}: The creature is [blinded] for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the [blinded] effect to 1d4 rounds.

@emph{Paralyzed}: The creature is [paralyzed] and [helpless] for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the [paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

@emph{Killed}: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the @emph{holy word} or not@emph{.}The banishment effect allows a [Will] save (at a --4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by @emph{holy word.}

Horrid Wilting

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Targets} living creatures, no two of which can be more than 60 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living creature, causing flesh to wither and crack and crumble to dust. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).

Hypnotic Pattern

@strong{Hypnotic Pattern}

@strong{School} illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} colorful lights in a 10-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} Concentration + 2 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of HD of creatures affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Affected creatures become [fascinated] by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must perform as a verbal component.

Hypnotism

@strong{Hypnotism}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} several living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 2d4 rounds (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD of creatures you affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not need to understand you to be [fascinated].

If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of --2.

While the subject is [fascinated] by this spell, it reacts as though it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.

A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a [Will] save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level or 1 round; see text for @emph{cause fear}

@strong{Effect} colorful lights in a 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} concentration + 2 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A twisting pattern of coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within. The spell affects a total number of HD of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first, and among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its HD.

@emph{6 or less}: [Unconscious] for 1d4 rounds, then [stunned] for 1d4 rounds, and then @emph{[confused]}for 1d4 rounds. result as [stunned] for nonliving creatures.)

@emph{7 to 12}: [Stunned] for 1d4 rounds, then @emph{[confused]}for an additional 1d4 rounds.

@emph{13 or more}:@emph{[Confused]}for 1d4 rounds.

Sightless creatures are not affected by @emph{scintillating pattern}.

@strong{Effect} one or more rays

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

@strong{Area} 30-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 24 hours

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] disbelief (if interacted with); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

@strong{Effect}magical sensor

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a [Will] save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its [Will] save.

Knowledge

[Will] Save Modifier

None*

+10

Secondhand (you have heard of the subject)

+5

Firsthand (you have met the subject)

+0

Familiar (you know the subject well)

--5

Connection

[Will] Save Modifier

Likeness or picture

--2

Possession or garment

--4

Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc.

--10

*You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of which you have no knowledge.

If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: @emph{[detect chaos]}, @emph{[detect evil]}, @emph{[detect good]}, @emph{[detect law]}, @emph{[detect magic]}, and @emph{[message]}.

If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24 hours.

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it. You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which you are unfamiliar yourself.

A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to cast spells with verbal components.

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6).

Secret Chest

@strong{Secret Chest}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, F (the chest and its replica)

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target} one chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level

@strong{Duration} 60 days or until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard action), and it appears next to you.

The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.

To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with a @emph{[wish]}spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.

@strong{Target} page touched, up to 3 sq. ft. in size

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

S@emph{ecret page}alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. @emph{[Explosive runes]}or @emph{[sepia snake sigil]}can be cast upon the @emph{secret page.}

A @emph{[comprehend languages]}spell alone cannot reveal a @emph{secret page}'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its @emph{secret page}form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A @emph{[detect magic]}spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. @emph{[True seeing]}reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with @emph{[comprehend languages].}A @emph{secret page}spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an @emph{erase}spell.

@strong{Effect} 20-ft.-square structure

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise---it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).

The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion, the former two being secured with @emph{[arcane lock]}and the latter by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas are protected by an @emph{alarm}spell. Finally, an @emph{unseen servant}is conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.

The @emph{secure shelter}contains crude furnishings---eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

You can see any objects or beings that are [invisible] within your range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, [invisible], and ethereal creatures.

The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

@emph{See invisibility}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Targets} one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 12 hours (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates or [Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes or no; see text

This spell functions like @emph{[disguise self]}, except that you can change the appearance of other people as well. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making [Will] saves or with [spell resistance].

Sending

@strong{Sending}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level} cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (fine copper wire)

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} 1 round; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an [Intelligence] score as low as 1 can understand the @emph{sending,}though the subject's ability to react is limited as normal by its [Intelligence]. Even if the @emph{sending}is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the @emph{sending}does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

Sepia Snake Sigil

@strong{Sepia Snake Sigil}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [force]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered amber worth 500 gp and a snake scale)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched book or written work

@strong{Duration} permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days + 1 day/level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work. The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the @emph{sepia snake sigil}springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the symbol and the reader.

Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the @emph{sepia snake}dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level have elapsed.

While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age, breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field provides no protection against physical injury. However, a [dying] subject does not lose hit points or become [stable] until the spell ends.

The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and @emph{[detect magic]}reveals only that the entire text is magical.

A @emph{[dispel magic]}can remove the sigil. An @emph{erase}spell destroys the entire page of text.

@emph{Sepia snake sigil}can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text, such as @emph{[secret page].}

Sequester

@strong{Sequester}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a basilisk eyelash and gum arabic)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft. cube/level) touched

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no or yes (object)

When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target [invisible] (as the @emph{[invisibility]}spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by @emph{sequester}become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

@emph{Note}: The [Will] save prevents an attended or magical object from being @emph{sequestered.}There is no save to see the @emph{sequestered}creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

Shades

@strong{Shades}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions like @emph{[shadow conjuration],}except that it mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work against nonbelievers.

Shadow Conjuration

@strong{Shadow Conjuration}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Effect} see text

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes; see text

You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. @emph{Shadow conjuration}can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.

@emph{Shadow conjurations}are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the @emph{shadow conjurations}to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the spell can make a [Will] save to recognize its true nature.

Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a [Will] save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to @emph{shadow conjuration}'s level (4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In addition, any effect created by @emph{shadow conjuration}allows [spell resistance], even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow objects or substances have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.

A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses. Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however, the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's [AC] bonuses are just one-fifth as large.

A creature that succeeds on its save sees the @emph{shadow conjurations}as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms. Objects automatically succeed on their [Will] saves against this spell.

@strong{Shadow Conjuration, Greater}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions like @emph{[shadow conjuration],}except that it duplicates any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory conjurations created deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.

Shadow Evocation

@strong{Shadow Evocation}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Effect} see text

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a [Will] save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a @emph{shadow evocation,}a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or [spell resistance]) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to @emph{shadow evocation'}s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.

Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.

Objects automatically succeed on their [Will] saves against this spell.

@strong{Shadow Evocation, Greater}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions like @emph{[shadow evocation],}except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a @emph{greater shadow evocation}, a damaging spell deals only three-fifths (60%) damage.

Shadow Walk

@strong{Shadow Walk}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} up to one touched creature/level

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

To use the @emph{shadow walk}spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.

In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.

Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 × 100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 × 1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature [fatigued] (no save).

@emph{Shadow walk}can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.

Any creatures touched by you when @emph{shadow walk}is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.

They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a [Will] saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

Shambler

@strong{Shambler}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} druid 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} three or more shambling mounds, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; see text

@strong{Duration} 7 days or 7 months (D); see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

The @emph{shambler}spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared. You can only have one @emph{shambler} spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have resistance to fire as normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where they are summoned is rainy, marshy, or damp.

Shapechange

@strong{Shapechange}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, F (jade circlet worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}10 min./level (D)

This spell allows you to take the form of a wide variety of creatures. This spell can function as @emph{[alter self], [beast shape IV], [elemental body IV], [form of the dragon III], [giant form II],}and @emph{[plant shape III]} depending on what form you take. You can change form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not during the action.

Shatter

@strong{Shatter}

@strong{School} evocation [sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a chip of mica)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area or Target} 5-ft.-radius spread; or one solid object or one crystalline creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); [Will] negates (object) or [Fortitude] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Shatter}creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.

Used as an area attack, @emph{shatter}destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.

Alternatively, you can target @emph{shatter}against a single solid nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), @emph{shatter}deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a [Fortitude] save for half damage.

Shield

@strong{Shield}

@strong{School} abjuration [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@emph{Shield}creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates @emph{[magic missile]}attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to [AC]. This bonus applies against [incorporeal] touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The @emph{shield}has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

Shield of Faith

@strong{Shield of Faith}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (parchment with a holy text written on it)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the target that averts and deflects attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2 deflection bonus to [AC], with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six levels you have (maximum +5 deflection bonus at 18th level).

Shield of Law

@strong{Shield of Law}

@strong{School} abjuration [lawful]; @strong{Level} cleric 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a reliquary worth 500 gp)

@strong{Range} 20 ft.

@strong{Targets} one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and @emph{slowing}chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike @emph{[protection from chaos]}, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as @emph{[protection from chaos]}does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is @emph{slowed}([Will] save negates, as the @emph{[slow]}spell, but against @emph{shield of law}'s save DC).

Shield Other

@strong{Shield Other}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 2, paladin 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a pair of platinum rings worth 50 gp worn by both you and the target)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as @emph{charm}effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered [Constitution] score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

Shillelagh

@strong{Shillelagh}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched nonmagical oak club or quarterstaff

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A quarterstaff gains this enhancement for both ends of the weapon. It deals damage as if it were two size categories larger (a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium 2d6, and a Large 3d6), +1 for its enhancement bonus. These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded by you. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by this spell.

Shocking Grasp

@strong{Shocking Grasp}

@strong{School} evocation [electricity]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature or object touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

Shout

@strong{Shout}

@strong{School} evocation [sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} 30 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial or [Reflex] negates (object); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is [deafened] for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a [Fortitude] save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful [Reflex] save. A @emph{shout}spell cannot penetrate a @emph{[silence]}spell.

@strong{Shout, Greater}

@strong{School} evocation [sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components}: V, S, F (a metal or ivory horn)

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial or [Reflex] negates (object); see text

This spell functions like @emph{[shout],}except that the cone deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level, maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be [stunned] for 1 round and [deafened] for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of the deafness with a successful [Fortitude] save. A creature holding vulnerable objects can attempt a [Reflex] save to negate the damage to those objects.

Shrink Item

@strong{Shrink Item}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched object of up to 2 cu. ft./level

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a @emph{shrink item}spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.

@emph{Shrink item}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell, in which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite number of times, but only by the original caster.

Silence

@strong{Silence}

@strong{School}illusion (glamer); @strong{Level}bard 2, cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 round

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area}20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or point in space

@strong{Duration}1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Will] negates; see text or none (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: yes; see text or no (object)

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a [Will] save to negate the spell and can use [spell resistance], if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and [spell resistance], but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area of a @emph{silence}spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, and effects.

Silent Image

@strong{Silent Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a bit of fleece)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} concentration

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.

Simulacrum

@strong{Simulacrum}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 12 hours

@strong{Components} V, S, M (ice sculpture of the target plus powdered rubies worth 500 gp per HD of the simulacrum)

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} one duplicate creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Simulacrum}creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check.

At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to a simulacrum.

Slay Living

@strong{Slay Living}

@strong{School} necromancy [death]; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You can attempt to slay any one living creature. When you cast this spell, your hand seethes with eerie dark fire. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to touch the target. The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. If the target's [Fortitude] saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.

Sleep

@strong{Sleep}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, M (fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} one or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{sleep}spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are [helpless]. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). @emph{Sleep}does not target [unconscious] creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

Sleet Storm

@strong{Sleet Storm}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [cold]; @strong{Level} druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (dust and water)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

Driving sleet blocks all sight (even [darkvision]) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details).

The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are [staggered] and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a --1 penalty on attack rolls, [AC], and [Reflex] saves. A @emph{slowed}creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple @emph{slow}effects don't stack. @emph{Slow}counters and dispels @emph{[haste]}.

Snare

@strong{Casting Time} 3 rounds

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} touched nonmagical circle of vine, rope, or thong with a 2 ft. diameter + 2 ft./level

@strong{Duration} Until triggered or broken

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast @emph{snare}upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be [entangled].

The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 [Strength] check that is a full-round action. The snare has [AC] 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

Soften Earth and Stone

@strong{Soften Earth and Stone}

@strong{School} transmutation [earth]; @strong{Level} druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 10-ft. square/level; see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected. Earth or stone creatures are not affected.

A creature in mud must succeed on a [Reflex] save or be caught for 1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.

While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat as a cave-in with no bury zone, see [Environment]).

A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed.

Solid Fog

@strong{Solid Fog}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Components}: V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell functions like @emph{[fog cloud]}, but in addition to obscuring sight, the @emph{solid fog} is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a @emph{solid fog} move at half their normal speed and take a --2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into @emph{solid fog} is slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in @emph{solid fog}. @emph{Solid fog}, and effects that work like @emph{solid fog}, do not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack penalties.

Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

@emph{Solid fog}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent @emph{solid fog}dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

Song of Discord

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a @emph{song of discord}to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen [unconscious].

Soul Bind

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} corpse

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned through @emph{[clone], [raise dead], reincarnation, [resurrection], [true resurrection],}or even a @emph{[miracle]}or a @emph{[wish].}Only by destroying the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which is then still dead).

The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound. If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.)

Sound Burst

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You blast an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in the area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a [Fortitude] save to avoid being [stunned] for 1 round. Creatures that cannot hear are not [stunned] but are still damaged.

Speak with Animals

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.

Speak with Dead

@strong{Speak with Dead}

@strong{School} necromancy [language-dependent]; @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 10 ft.

@strong{Target} one dead creature

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.

If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a [Will] save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If successful, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you, using Bluff. The soul can only speak about what it knew in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after its death.

If the corpse has been subject to @emph{speak with dead}within the past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

Speak with Plants

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you.

Spectral Hand

@strong{Spectral Hand}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} one spectral hand

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast can be delivered by the @emph{spectral hand}. The spell gives you a +2 bonus on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight, the hand returns to you and hovers.

The hand is [incorporeal] and thus cannot be harmed by normal weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed [Reflex] save and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an [AC] of 22 (+8 size, +4 natural armor). Your [Intelligence] modifier applies to the hand's [AC] as if it were the hand's [Dexterity] modifier. The hand has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

Spell Immunity

@strong{Spell Immunity}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable [spell resistance] regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which [spell resistance] doesn't apply. @emph{Spell immunity}protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.

Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one @emph{spell immunity}or @emph{greater spell immunity}spell in effect on it at a time.

@strong{Spell Immunity, Greater}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 8

This spell functions like @emph{[spell immunity]}, except the immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A creature can have only one @emph{[spell immunity]}or @emph{greater spell immunity}spell in effect on it at a time.

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}wooden quarterstaff touched

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given time, and you cannot have more than one @emph{spellstaff}at any given time. You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were among those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material components required to cast the spell when you store it in the @emph{spellstaff.}

Spell Turning

@strong{Spell Turning}

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a small silver mirror)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} until expended or 10 min./level

Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. @emph{Spell turning}also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.

When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by @emph{spell turning}effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll randomly to determine the result.

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A @emph{spider climbing}creature retains its [Dexterity] bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

Spike Growth

@strong{Spike Growth}

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} one 20-ft. square/level

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.

In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, @emph{spike growth}can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a [Reflex] save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its land speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a @emph{cure}spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{spike growth}. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 28 for @emph{spike growth}(or DC 27 for @emph{spike growth}cast by a ranger).@emph{Spike growth}can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

@strong{Area} one 20-ft. square/level

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background.

@emph{Spike stones}impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on a [Reflex] save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a @emph{cure}spell (which also restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

Magic traps such as @emph{spike stones}are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find @emph{spike stones}. The DC is 25 + spell level, or DC 29 for @emph{spike stones}.@emph{Spike stones}is a magic trap that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

Spiritual Weapon

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}magic weapon of force

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your [Wisdom] modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have [damage reduction]. As a force effect, it can strike [incorporeal] creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the @emph{spiritual weapon}is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.

A @emph{spiritual weapon}cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but @emph{[dispel magic]}, @emph{[disintegrate]}, a @emph{[sphere of annihilation]}, or a @emph{[rod of cancellation]}affects it. A @emph{spiritual weapon}'s [AC] against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).

If an attacked creature has [spell resistance], you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that [spell resistance] the first time the @emph{spiritual weapon}strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a @emph{spiritual weapon}of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A @emph{statue}spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points. The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes serious damage. The subject of a @emph{statue}spell can return to its normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if it so desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated, @emph{status}allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded, [disabled], [staggered], [unconscious], [dying], [nauseated], [panicked], [stunned], poisoned, [diseased], [confused]@emph{,}or the like. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

Stinking Cloud

@emph{Stinking cloud}creates a bank of fog like that created by @emph{[fog cloud]}, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become [nauseated]. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each [nauseated] character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.

@emph{Stinking cloud}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent @emph{stinking cloud}dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains [DR] 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

Stone Tell

@strong{Stone Tell}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete descriptions if asked. A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from providing the details you are looking for. You can speak with natural or worked stone.

Stone to Flesh

@strong{Stone to Flesh}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one [petrified] creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (object); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell restores a [petrified] creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 [Fortitude] save to survive the process. Any [petrified] creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

Storm of Vengeance

@strong{Storm of Vengeance}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} cleric 9, druid 9

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} 360-ft.-radius storm cloud

@strong{Duration} concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under the cloud must succeed on a [Fortitude] save or be [deafened] for 1d4 × 10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.

@emph{2nd Round}: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage (no save).

@emph{3rd Round}: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud. You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A creature struck can attempt a [Reflex] save for half damage.

@emph{4th Round}: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save).

@emph{5th through 10th Rounds}: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including [darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed is reduced by three-quarters.

Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a Concentration check against a DC equal to the @emph{storm of vengeance}'s save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

Suggestion

@strong{Suggestion}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until completed

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The @emph{suggestion}must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

A very reasonable @emph{suggestion}causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as --1 or --2).

@strong{Suggestion, Mass}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[suggestion]}, except that it can affect more creatures. The same @emph{[suggestion]}applies to all these creatures.

Summon Instrument

@strong{Summon Instrument}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} bard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} one summoned handheld musical instrument

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell summons one handheld musical instrument of your choice. This instrument appears in your hands or at your feet (your choice). The instrument is typical for its type. Only one instrument appears per casting, and it will play only for you. You can't summon an instrument too large to be held in two hands. The summoned instrument disappears at the end of this spell.

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning) [see text]; @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a tiny bag and a small candle)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one summoned creature

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider, elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10--1. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you cast the spell.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material components (such as @emph{[wish]}).

When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures on Table 10--1 marked with an “*” are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature. Creatures marked with an “*” always have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.

@strong{Effect} one summoned creature

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions as you command.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material components (such as @emph{[wish]}).

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10--2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.

@strong{Effect} one swarm of bats, rats, or spiders

@strong{Duration} concentration + 2 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which attacks all other creatures within its area. (You may summon the swarm so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction of travel.

Sunbeam

@strong{Sunbeam}

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level or until all beams are [exhausted]

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates and [Reflex] half; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is [exhausted].

Each creature in the beam is [blinded] and takes 4d6 points of damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double damage. A successful [Reflex] save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.

An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a [Reflex] save is successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.

The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.

Sunburst

@strong{Sunburst}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Area} 80-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Sunburst}causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are [blinded] and take 6d6 points of damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural takes double damage. A successful [Reflex] save negates the blindness and reduces the damage by half.

An undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a [Reflex] save is successful. In addition, the burst results in the destruction of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its save.

The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.

@emph{Sunburst}dispels any darkness spells of lower than 9th level within its area.

Symbol of Death

@strong{Symbol of Death}

@strong{School} necromancy [death]; @strong{Level} cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth 5,000 gp each)

@strong{Range} 0 ft.; see text

@strong{Effect} one symbol

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a @emph{symbol of death}kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The @emph{symbol of death}affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the @emph{symbol}becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the @emph{symbol of death}is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the @emph{symbol}only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the @emph{symbol}is still active, it must save again.

Until it is triggered, the @emph{symbol of death}is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a @emph{symbol of death}must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the @emph{symbol of death}ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the @emph{symbol of death}works normally.

As a default, a @emph{symbol of death}is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a @emph{symbol of death}'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.

In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a @emph{symbol of death}to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a @emph{symbol of death}offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered @emph{symbol of death} remains untriggered if an item bearing the @emph{symbol of death}is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a @emph{symbol of death}cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.

You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a @emph{symbol of death}can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

When scribing a @emph{symbol of death}, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect@emph{.}Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.

You also can attune any number of creatures to the @emph{symbol of death,}but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a @emph{symbol of death}cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own @emph{symbols of death}, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.

@emph{[Read magic]}allows you to identify a @emph{symbol}with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the @emph{symbol's}spell level). Of course, if the @emph{symbol}is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.

A @emph{symbol of death}can be removed by a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}targeted solely on the rune. An @emph{erase}spell has no effect on a @emph{symbol of death.}Destruction of the surface where a @emph{symbol of death}is inscribed destroys the @emph{symbol}but also triggers it.

@emph{Symbol of death}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent @emph{symbol of death}that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of death}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of death}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for @emph{symbol of death}.

Symbol of Fear

@strong{Symbol of Fear}

@strong{School} necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that all creatures within 60 feet of the @emph{symbol of fear}instead become [panicked] for 1 round per caster level.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of fear}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of fear}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for @emph{symbol of fear}.

Symbol of Insanity

@strong{Symbol of Insanity}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that all creatures within the radius of the @emph{symbol of insanity}instead become permanently insane (as the @emph{[insanity]}spell).

Unlike @emph{[symbol of death]}, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a @emph{symbol of insanity}simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of insanity}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of insanity}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for @emph{symbol of insanity}.

Symbol of Pain

@strong{Symbol of Pain}

@strong{School} necromancy [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that each creature within the radius of a @emph{symbol of pain}instead suffers wracking pains that impose a --4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike @emph{[symbol of death]}, @emph{symbol of pain}has no hit point limit; once triggered, a @emph{symbol of pain}simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of pain}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of pain}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for @emph{symbol of pain}.

Symbol of Persuasion

@strong{Symbol of Persuasion}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that all creatures within the radius of a @emph{symbol of persuasion}instead become charmed by the caster (as the @emph{[charm monster]}spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

Unlike @emph{[symbol of death]}, @emph{symbol of persuasion}has no hit point limit; once triggered, a @emph{symbol of persuasion}simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of persuasion}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of persuasion}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for @emph{symbol of persuasion}.

Symbol of Sleep

@strong{Symbol of Sleep}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the @emph{symbol of sleep}instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the @emph{[sleep]}spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike @emph{[symbol of death]}, @emph{symbol of sleep}has no hit point limit; once triggered, a @emph{symbol of sleep}simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of sleep}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of sleep}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for @emph{symbol of sleep}.

Symbol of Stunning

@strong{Symbol of Stunning}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a @emph{symbol of stunning}instead become [stunned] for 1d6 rounds.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of stunning}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of stunning}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for @emph{symbol of stunning}.

Symbol of Weakness

@strong{Symbol of Weakness}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

This spell functions like @emph{[symbol of death]}, except that every creature within 60 feet of a @emph{symbol of weakness}instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of [Strength] damage.

Unlike @emph{[symbol of death]}, @emph{symbol of weakness}has no hit point limit; once triggered, a @emph{symbol of weakness}simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.

@emph{Note}: Magic traps such as @emph{symbol of weakness}are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a @emph{symbol of weakness}and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for @emph{symbol of weakness}.

Sympathetic Vibration

@strong{Sympathetic Vibration}

@strong{School} evocation [sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a tuning fork)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one freestanding structure

@strong{Duration} up to 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create a damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10 points of damage per round to the target structure, bypassing hardness. You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round per level. If the spell is cast upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding stone dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.

@emph{Sympathetic vibration}cannot affect creatures (including constructs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no saving throw to resist the effect.

Sympathy

@strong{Sympathy}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 hour

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a drop of honey and crushed pearls worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.

Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 × 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.

@emph{Sympathy}counters and dispels @emph{[antipathy]}.

@chapter Arcane Archer
@anchor{#arcane-archer}
Many who seek to perfect the use of the bow sometimes pursue the path of the arcane archer. Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as they possess the ability to strike at targets with unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike at foes around corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies that cower behind such cover. At the height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.

Those who have trained as both rangers and wizards excel as arcane archers, although other multiclass combinations are not unheard of. Arcane archers may be found wherever elves travel, but not all are allies of the elves. Many, particularly half-elven arcane archers, use elven traditions solely for their own gain, or worse, against the elves whose very traditions they adhere to.

@strong{Role}: Arcane archers deal death from afar, winnowing down opponents while their allies rush into hand-to-hand combat. With their capacity to unleash hails of arrows on the enemy, they represent the pinnacle of ranged combat.

@strong{Alignment}: Arcane archers can be of any alignment. Elf or half-elf arcane arches tend to be free-spirited and are rarely lawful. Similarly, it is uncommon for elven arcane archers to be evil, and overall the path of the arcane archer is more often pursued by good or neutral characters.

All of the following are class features of the arcane archer prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: An arcane archer is proficient with all [simple] and [martial weapons], light armor, medium armor, and shields.

@strong{Spells per Day}: At the indicated levels, an arcane archer gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an arcane archer, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

@strong{Enhance Arrows (Su)}: At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for him.

In addition, the arcane archer's arrows gain a number of additional qualities as he gains additional levels. The elemental, elemental burst, and aligned qualities can be changed once per day, when the arcane archer prepares spells or, in the case of spontaneous spellcasters, after 8 hours of rest.

At 3rd level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental themed weapon qualities: @emph{[flaming]},@emph{[frost]}, or @emph{[shock]}.

At 5th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains the @emph{[distance]} weapon quality.

At 7th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following elemental burst weapon qualities: @emph{[flaming burst]}, @emph{[icy burst]}, or @emph{[shocking burst]}. This ability replaces the ability gained at 3rd level.

At 9th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains one of the following aligned weapon qualities: @emph{[anarchic]}, @emph{[axiomatic]}, @emph{[holy]}, or @emph{[unholy]}. The arcane archer cannot choose an ability that is the opposite of his alignment (for example, a lawful good arcane archer could not choose @emph{[anarchic]} or @emph{[unholy]} as his weapon quality).

The bonuses granted by a magic bow apply as normal to arrows that have been enhanced with this ability. Only the larger enhancement bonus applies. Duplicate abilities do not stack.

@strong{Imbue Arrow} @strong{(Sp)}: At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. A spell cast in this way uses its standard casting time and the arcane archer can fire the arrow as part of the casting. The arrow must be fired during the round that the casting is completed or the spell is wasted. If the arrow misses, the spell is wasted.

@strong{Seeker Arrow} @strong{(Sp)}: At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow at a target known to him within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per day at 4th level, and one additional time per day for every two levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of four times per day at 10th level.

@strong{Phase Arrow} @strong{(Sp)}: At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to him within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, armor, and shield modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional time per day for every two levels beyond 6th, to a maximum of three times per day at 10th level.

@strong{Hail of Arrows} @strong{(Sp)}: In lieu of his regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.

@strong{Arrow of Death} @strong{(Sp)}: At 10th level, an arcane archer can create a special type of@emph{[slaying arrow]}that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a [Fortitude] save or be slain immediately. The DC of this save is equal to 20 + the arcane archer's [Charisma] modifier. It takes 1 day to make a @emph{[slaying arrow]}, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The @emph{[slaying arrow]}lasts no longer than 1 year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.

Arcane Trickster

@node Arcane Trickster
@chapter Arcane Trickster
@anchor{#arcane-trickster}
Few can match the guile and craftiness of arcane tricksters. These prodigious thieves blend the subtlest aspects of the arcane with the natural cunning of the bandit and the scoundrel, using spells to enhance their natural thieving abilities. Arcane tricksters can pick locks, disarm traps, and lift purses from a safe distance using their magical legerdemain, and as often as not seek humiliation as a goal to triumph over their foes than more violent solutions.

The path to becoming an arcane trickster is a natural progression for rogues who have supplemented their talents for theft with the study of the arcane. Multiclass rogue/sorcerers and rogue/bards are the most common arcane tricksters, although other combinations are possible. Arcane tricksters are most often found in large, cosmopolitan cities where their talents for magical larceny can be most effectively put to use, prowling the streets and stealing from the unwary.

@strong{Role}: With their mastery of magic, arcane tricksters can make for even more subtle or confounding opponents than standard rogues. Ranged legerdemain enhances their skill as thieves, and their ability to make sneak attacks without[flanking] or as part of a spell can make arcane tricksters formidable damage-dealers.

@strong{Alignment}: All arcane tricksters have a penchant for mischief and thievery, and are therefore never lawful. Although they sometimes acquire their magical abilities through the studious path of wizardry, their magical aptitude more often stems from a sorcerous bloodline. As such, many arcane tricksters are of a chaotic alignment.

All of the following are class features of the arcane trickster prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Arcane tricksters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@strong{Spells per Day}: When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

@strong{Ranged Legerdemain (Su)}: An arcane trickster can use @ref{#disable-device,Disable Device} and @ref{#sleight-of-hand,Sleight of Hand} at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. She can only use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.

@strong{Sneak Attack}: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a [sneak attack] bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

@strong{Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex)}: Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack she makes to be a [sneak attack] (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to [critical hit]s take no extra damage (though they still lose any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] against the attack).

At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.

@strong{Tricky Spells (Su)}: Starting at 5th level, an arcane trickster can cast her spells without their somatic or verbal components, as if using the [Still Spell] and [Silent Spell] feats. Spells cast using this ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can use this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional time per every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per day at 9th level. The arcane trickster decides to use this ability at the time of casting.

@strong{Invisible Thief (Su)}: At 9th level, an arcane trickster can become [invisible], as if under the effects of @emph{[greater invisibility],} as a free action. She can remain [invisible] for a number of rounds per day equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for this effect is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not be consecutive.

@strong{Surprise Spells}: At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add her sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the targets are [flat-footed]. This additional damage only applies to spells that deal hit point damage, and the additional damage is of the same type as the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or halve the damage, it also negates or halves the sneak attack damage.

Assassin

@node Assassin
@chapter Assassin
@anchor{#assassin}
A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan, and his medium is death. Trained in a variety of killing techniques, assassins are among the most feared classes.

While nearly any class is capable of becoming an assassin, rogues suit the part more than any other, from both an ability viewpoint and an ideological one. Though they make excellent allies during combat, assassins excel in more clandestine situations, and the best assassins are the ones the victims never knew existed.

@strong{Role}: Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing companions as liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin's missions put him in the company of adventurers for long stretches at a time, but few people are comfortable trusting a professional assassin to watch their backs in a fight, and are more likely to let the emotionless killer scout ahead or help prepare ambushes.

@strong{Alignment}: Due to its necessary selfishness and callous indifference toward taking lives, the assassin class attracts those with evil alignments more than any others. Because the profession requires a degree of self-discipline, chaotic characters are ill suited to becoming these shadowy killers. Neutral characters sometimes become assassins, frequently thinking of themselves as simple professionals performing a job, yet the nature of their duties inevitably pushes them toward an evil alignment.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@section Class Features
@anchor{#class-features-7}
All of the following are class features of the assassin prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

@strong{Sneak Attack}: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). If an assassin gets a [sneak attack] bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

@strong{Death Attack (Ex)}: If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). Studying the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target detects the assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his [Dexterity] bonus to his @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} or is[flanked]). If the victim of such a death attack fails a [Fortitude] save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's [Int] modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered [helpless] and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.

@strong{Poison Use}: Assassins are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying [poison] to a blade (see @ref{#poison,Poison}).

@strong{Save Bonus against Poison}: At 2nd level, the assassin gains a +1 saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus increase by +1 every two levels.

@strong{Uncanny Dodge (Ex)}: At 2nd level, an assassin cannot be caught [flat-footed], even if the attacker is [invisible]. He still loses his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. An assassin with this ability can still lose his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.

If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains [improved uncanny dodge] instead.

@strong{Hidden Weapons (Ex)}: At 4th level, an assassin becomes a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all @ref{#sleight-of-hand,Sleight of Hand} skill checks made to prevent others from noticing them.

@strong{True Death (Su)}: Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using @emph{[raise dead]} or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting @emph{[remove curse]} the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the @emph{[remove curse]} is 10 + the assassin's level.

@strong{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)}: At 5th level and higher, an assassin can no longer be[flanked]. This defense denies a [rogue] the ability to sneak attack the assassin by[flanking] him, unless the attacker has at least four more [rogue] levels than the target has assassin levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum [rogue] level required to[flank] the character.

@strong{Quiet Death (Ex)}: At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also make a @ref{#stealth,Stealth} check, opposed by @ref{#perception,Perception} checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection.

@strong{Hide in Plain Sight (Su)}: At 8th level, an assassin can use the @ref{#stealth,Stealth} skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.

@strong{Swift Death (Ex)}: At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He must still [sneak attack] his foe using a melee weapon that deals damage.

@strong{Angel of Death (Su)}: At 10th level, the assassin becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents @emph{[raise dead]} and @emph{[resurrection]} (although @emph{[true resurrection]} works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect.

Dragon Disciple

@node Dragon Disciple
@chapter Dragon Disciple
@anchor{#dragon-disciple}
As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.

Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and---at the pinnacle of their abilities---assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.

@strong{Role}: With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples' draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and flight to destroy their foes directly.

@strong{Alignment}: Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.

@anchor{#class-features-8}
All of the following are class features of the dragon disciple prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Dragon disciples gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@strong{Spells per Day}: At the indicated levels, a dragon disciple gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a dragon disciple, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

@strong{Blood of Dragons}: A dragon disciple adds his level to his [sorcerer] levels when determining the powers gained from his bloodline. If the dragon disciple does not have levels of [sorcerer], he instead gains bloodline powers of the [draconic bloodline], using his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level in this class and that type must be the same as his [sorcerer] type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a [sorcerer] unless he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if the [sorcerer] gains spell slots of the spell's level.

@strong{Natural Armor Increase (Ex)}: As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on [Table: Dragon Disciple]. These armor bonuses stack.

@strong{Ability Boost (Ex)}: As a dragon disciple gains levels in this prestige class, his ability scores increase as noted on [Table: Dragon Disciple]. These increases stack and are gained as if through level advancement.

@strong{Bloodline Feat}: Upon reaching 2nd level, and every three levels thereafter, a dragon disciple receives one bonus feat, chosen from the draconic bloodline's [bonus feat list].

@strong{Dragon Bite (Ex)}: At 2nd level, whenever the dragon disciple uses his bloodline to grow claws, he also gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1--1/2 times the dragon disciple's Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline.

@strong{Breath Weapon (Su)}: At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple, as detailed under the [Draconic sorcerer bloodline] description.

@strong{Blindsense (Ex)}: At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains [blindsense] with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make @ref{#perception,Perception} checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his [blindsense] ability, provided that he has [line of effect] to that creature.

Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with [blindsense]. A creature with [blindsense] is still denied its [Dexterity] bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.

@strong{Dragon Form} @strong{(Sp)}: At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like @emph{[form of the dragon I]}. At 10th level, this ability functions as @emph{[form of the dragon II]} and the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts @emph{form of the dragon,} he must assume the form of a dragon of the same type as his bloodline.

@strong{Wings (Su)}: At 9th level, a dragon disciple gains the wings bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple's speed increases to 90 feet.

Duelist

@node Duelist
@chapter Duelist
@anchor{#duelist}
Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and countering attacks with swift thrusts of their blades. They may wear armor, but generally eschew such bulky protection as their grace allows them to dodge their opponents with ease. While others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.

The path to the duelist is natural for rogues and bards, as those classes do not rely on armor for defense, although nearly as many duelists come from the ranks of fighters and rangers. They are often found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and etiquette for battle.

@strong{Role}: The abilities of duelists complement those rogues or bards who wish to accentuate their fighting prowess but, because of their lack of heavy armor, are afraid to leap into combat. Duelists fight in the forefront alongside fighters, barbarians, and other melee combatants, deftly avoiding the blades of their opponents while expertly targeting their vulnerabilities.

@strong{Alignment}: Duelists can be of any alignment, although since most hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to eschew lawful behavior. Lawful duelists are not unheard of, however, and such duelists often adhere to a strict code of honor, refusing to attack unarmed or obviously inferior opponents.

@node Class Features
@section Class Features
@anchor{#class-features-9}
All of the following are class features of the duelist prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: The duelist is proficient with all [simple][and][martial weapons]. Duelists are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

@strong{Canny Defense (Ex)}: When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of [Intelligence] bonus (if any) per duelist class level to her [Dexterity] bonus to modify @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} while wielding a melee weapon. If a duelist is caught [flat-footed] or otherwise denied her [Dexterity] bonus, she also loses this bonus.

@strong{Precise Strike (Ex)}: A duelist gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding her duelist level to her damage roll.

When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to [critical hit]s is also immune to a precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from [critical hit]s also protects a creature from a precise strike.

@strong{Improved Reaction (Ex)}: At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the [Improved Initiative] feat.

@strong{Parry (Ex)}: At 2nd level, a duelist learns to parry the attacks of other creatures, causing them to miss. Whenever the duelist takes a full attack action with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she can elect not to take one of her attacks. At any time before her next turn, she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category that the attacking creature is larger than the duelist, the duelist takes a --4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist also takes a --4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent ally. The duelist must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made.

@strong{Enhanced Mobility (Ex)}: Starting at 3rd level, when wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4 bonus to [AC] against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened square.

@strong{Combat Reflexes}: At 4th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the [Combat Reflexes] feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon.

@strong{Grace (Ex)}: At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2 competence bonus on all [Reflex] saving throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is wearing light or no armor and not using a shield.

@strong{Riposte (Ex)}: Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack she successfully parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is within reach.

@strong{Acrobatic Charge (Ex)}: At 6th level, a duelist gains the ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain.

@strong{Elaborate Defense (Ex)}: At 7th level and higher, if a duelist chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, she gains an additional +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC] for every 3 levels of duelist she has attained.

@strong{Deflect Arrows}: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the [Deflect Arrows] feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. The duelist does not need a free hand to use this feat.

@strong{No Retreat (Ex)}: At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the duelist that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the duelist.

@strong{Crippling Critical (Ex)}: When you confirm a [critical hit] using a light or one-handed piercing weapon, you can apply one of the following penalties in addition to the damage dealt: reduce all of the target's speeds by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), 1d4 points of Strength or [Dexterity] damage, --4 penalty on all saving throws, --4 penalty to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, or 2d6 points of bleed damage. These penalties last for 1 minute, except for ability damage, which must be healed normally, and bleed damage, which continues until the target receives magic healing or a DC 15 @ref{#heal,Heal} skill check.

Eldritch Knight

@node Eldritch Knight
@chapter Eldritch Knight
@anchor{#eldritch-knight}
Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare among magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside fighters, barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch knight's blade.

Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always begin their paths as multiclassed characters, such as fighter/wizards or ranger/sorcerers. They may be found wherever studies of the arcane are as prevalent as martial training.

@strong{Role}: Eldritch knights blend the abilities of fighting classes and spellcasters, hurling magic at the enemy one moment and hewing down their opponents with steel the next. They are just as comfortable fighting in the thick of combat as they are casting spells at foes while remaining safely behind their compatriots. Their versatility makes them valuable allies when the nature of an upcoming battle is unclear.

@strong{Alignment}: The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as varied as the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a career as a soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any alignment. Maintaining a balance between studies of arcane lore and martial techniques requires great discipline, however, and for that reason many favor lawful alignments.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@strong{Bonus Feat}: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus [combat feat]. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets from advancing levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats. An eldritch knight gains an additional [combat feat] at 5th and 9th level.

@strong{Diverse Training}: An eldritch knight adds his level to any levels of [fighter] he might have for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if he has no fighter levels, treat his eldritch knight levels as levels of fighter). He also adds his level to any levels in an arcane spellcasting class for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats.

@strong{Spells per Day}: At the indicated levels, an eldritch knight gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an eldritch knight, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

@strong{Spell Critical (Su)}: At 10th level, whenever an eldritch knight successfully confirms a [critical hit], he can cast a spell as a swift action. The spell must include the target of the attack as one of its targets or in its area of effect. Casting this spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The caster must still meet all of the spell's components and must roll for arcane spell failure if necessary.

Loremaster

@node Loremaster
@chapter Loremaster
@anchor{#loremaster}
The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare or unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater with time is infinite.

The loremaster class holds little appeal for non-spellcasters---indeed, before one can devote a life to the studies and traditions of the loremaster, a character must first master several spells of the school of divination. Most loremasters begin their paths as clerics or wizards, but any character capable of casting enough divination spells can, eventually, become a loremaster.

@strong{Role}: Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster's reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part, the loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to a party. Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old lore can be discovered in books---new lore must be sought out in the world. These more active loremasters might join up with an adventuring party for the benefit of the journey, content with whatever knowledge might be picked up along the way.

@strong{Alignment}: Most loremasters cannot be bothered with distracting and pointless philosophies such as ethics, and so tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.

All of the following are Class Features of the loremaster prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Loremasters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@strong{Spells per Day/Spells Known}: When a new loremaster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

@strong{Secret}: At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the loremaster chooses one secret from the Loremaster Secrets table. His level plus [Intelligence] modifier determines which secrets he can choose. He can't choose the same secret twice.

@strong{Bonus Languages}: A loremaster can learn any new language at 4th and 8th level.

@strong{Greater Lore (Ex)}: At 6th level, a loremaster gains the ability to understand magic items. Whenever a loremaster examines a magic item to determine its properties, he gains a +10 circumstance bonus on his @ref{#spellcraft,Spellcraft} skill check.

@strong{True Lore (Ex)}: At 10th level, a loremaster's knowledge becomes vast indeed. Once per day a loremaster can use his knowledge to gain the effect of a @emph{[legend lore]}spell or an @emph{[analyze dweomer]}spell. If used to create a @emph{[legend lore]} effect, this ability has a casting time of 1 minute, regardless of how much information is already known about the subject in question.

Mystic Theurge

@node Mystic Theurge
@chapter Mystic Theurge
@anchor{#mystic-theurge}
Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.

Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that they gain increase their mastery over both.

@strong{Role}: The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any party, supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic theurges travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts, magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that group's goals do not directly conflict with their own.

@strong{Alignment}: The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the benefit---or control---of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.

All of the following are features of the mystic theurge prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Mystic theurges gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

@strong{Spells per Day}: When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.

@strong{Combined Spells (Su)}: A mystic theurge can prepare and cast spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the available slots from any of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. At 1st level, a mystic theurge can prepare 1st-level spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the 2nd-level slots of the other spellcasting class. Every two levels thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells would take up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class used to cast the spell.

Spontaneous spellcasters can only select spells that they have prepared that day using non-spontaneous classes for this ability, even if the spells have already been cast. For example, a cleric/sorcerer/mystic theurge can use this ability to spontaneously cast a @emph{[bless]} spell using a 2nd-level sorcerer spell slot, if the character had a prepared @emph{[bless]}spell using a 1st-level cleric spell slot, even if that spell had already been cast that day.

@strong{Spell Synthesis (Su)}: At 10th level, a mystic theurge can cast two spells, one from each of his spellcasting classes, using one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time. The mystic theurge can make any decisions concerning the spells independently. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a --2 penalty on saves made against each spell. The mystic theurge receives a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. A mystic theurge may use this ability once per day.

PF Chronicler

@node PF Chronicler
@chapter PF Chronicler
@anchor{#pf-chronicler}
Brave explorers and scavengers of lost or forgotten knowledge, PF chroniclers are quintessential adventurers, exploring the world for esoteric truths, magical and mundane relics and artifacts, and new and mysterious vistas, be they wonderful or terrible. For some, this journey is purely about the wealth, for others the glory of discovery, and still more are stirred by the irresistible drive to uncover the bones of the ages and legends of forgotten epochs in an effort to chronicle the deeds of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

The PF chronicler class attracts any who see the world as a great mystery to be unraveled, and thus has a diverse and varied following, from fighters and bards to wizards and clerics, and everything in between. However, due to their role as historians and preservers of posterity, hopefuls must be literate and scholarly---for PF chroniclers are more than mere treasure hunters.

@strong{Role}: The PF chronicler's missions often thrust her into the role of party leader, and adventures typically result from, and revolve around, his endless quests.

@strong{Alignment}: A PF chronicler's alignment largely determines her motivations. Good characters tend to view their missions as noble ventures, neutral characters seek to preserve knowledge for knowledge's sake, and evil characters are driven by an urge to accumulate wealth and add to their own glory.

@node Class Features
@section Class Features
@anchor{#class-features-13}
The following are class features of the PF chronicler prestige class.

@strong{[Bardic Knowledge] (Ex)}: This ability is identical to the bard class feature of the same name, and levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability.

@strong{Deep Pockets (Ex)}: A PF chronicler collects items as well as lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into a backpack, including [potions] and [scrolls] (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, the chronicler can retrieve no more items until she refills her deep pockets by spending a few hours and an amount of gold to bring her total up to 100 gp per class level.

In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her [light encumbrance]. This does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same amount of weight normally should. Finally, the PF chronicler gains a +4 bonus on @ref{#sleight-of-hand,Sleight of Hand} checks made to conceal small objects on her person.

@strong{Master Scribe (Ex)}: A PF chronicler adds her class level as a bonus on all @ref{#linguistics,Linguistics} and @ref{#profession,Profession} (scribe) checks, as well as @ref{#use-magic-device,Use Magic Device} checks involving [scrolls] or other written magical items. A PF chronicler can make @ref{#linguistics,Linguistics} checks to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on @ref{#linguistics,Linguistics} and @ref{#profession,Profession} (scribe) checks, even if distracted or endangered.

@strong{Live to Tell the Tale (Ex)}: At 2nd level, once per day per two class levels, a PF chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects.

@strong{Pathfinding (Ex)}: Beginning at 2nd level, a PF chronicler develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A PF chronicler gains a +5 bonus on @ref{#survival,Survival} checks made to avoid becoming lost and to [Intelligence] checks to escape a @emph{[maze]} spell. In addition, she always uses the “road or trail” [overland movement] modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With a DC 15 @ref{#survival,Survival} check, the PF chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class level.

@strong{[Bardic Performance] (Su)}: At 3rd level, a PF chronicler gains this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard level.

@strong{Improved Aid (Ex)}: PF chroniclers frequently serve as the companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level, a PF chronicler using the [aid another] action grants a +4 bonus, rather than the normal +2.

@strong{Epic Tales (Su)}: A 4th-level PF chronicler can inscribe a tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of bardic music through the written word. To create an epic tale requires the PF chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her bardic performance ability equal to twice the duration of the epic tale (maximum duration of 10 rounds), and any relevant [Performance] skill check is made with @ref{#profession,Profession} (scribe) instead. An epic tale affects only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a performance. A PF chronicler may apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds expended during its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed.

@strong{Whispering Campaign (Ex)}: PF chroniclers influence the world through their control of information and ability to shape public perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the PF chronicler can create the effect of a @emph{[doom]} spell as cast by a sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a language-dependent effect.

Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of bardic music creates the effect of the @emph{[enthrall]} spell, but at the end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction of the PF chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level.

@strong{Inspire Action (Su)}: As a special use of bardic music, a 6th-level PF chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn.

At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a standard action instead.

@strong{Call Down the Legends (Su)}: At 7th level, once per week as a full-round action, a PF chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human barbarians, as if she used a bronze @emph{[horn of Valhalla]}; these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive with the normal [starting equipment for barbarians] and attack anyone the chronicler designates.

@strong{Greater Epic Tales (Su)}: At 8th level, the PF chronicler's written word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's [Charisma] score where applicable.

@strong{Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su)}: Once per week as a full-round action, a 10th-level PF chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human barbarians, as if she used an iron @emph{[horn of Valhalla].} The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are constructs, with the [incorporeal] subtype (they take 50% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing @emph{+2 studded leather}and wielding @emph{+1 [ghost touch] greataxes} (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at [Will] saves or become [shaken] for 1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the PF chronicler's [Charisma] modifier).

Shadowdancer

@node Shadowdancer
@chapter Shadowdancer
@anchor{#shadowdancer}
Civilized folk have always feared the night, barring themselves behind doors or comforting themselves with bonfires when the shadows grow long, rightfully wary of the creatures that prowl the darkness. Yet long ago, some learned that the best way to conquer an enemy is to embrace it. These were the first shadowdancers.

Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception. Unbound by any specified morality or traditional code, shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types who have seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.

@strong{Role}: Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons. Many adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of their teams due to their incredible stealth and ability to surprise enemies with lightning-quick attacks where they're least expected. For this reason, their services are often sought out by those groups in need of scouts or spies.

@strong{Alignment}: Because of their nature as visually duplicitous tricksters, shadowdancers do not fit comfortably into the lawful category, as many use their talents to avoid the eyes of legitimate authority. Yet though they are allies of darkness, shadowdancers are neither inherently evil nor predisposed to good. To them, the darkness is simply the darkness, without any of the usual moral connotations made by the unenlightened.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@node Class Features
@section Class Features
@anchor{#class-features-14}
All of the following are features of the shadowdancer prestige class.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Shadowdancers are proficient with the club, crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Shadowdancers are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

@strong{Hide in Plain Sight (Su)}: A shadowdancer can use the @ref{#stealth,Stealth} skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.

@strong{Evasion (Ex)}: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light armor or no armor.

@strong{Darkvision (Ex)}: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains [darkvision] out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has [darkvision], the range increases by 30 feet.

@strong{Uncanny Dodge (Ex)}: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer cannot be caught [flat-footed], even if the attacker is [invisible]. He still loses her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. An shadowdancer with this ability can still lose his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.

If a shadowdancer already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains [improved uncanny dodge] instead.

@strong{Rogue Talent}: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a shadowdancer gains a special ability that allows her to confound her foes. This functions as the [rogue talent] class feature. A shadowdancer cannot select an individual talent more than once. If a shadowdancer has the [advanced talents] rogue class feature, she can chose from the [advanced talents] list instead.

@strong{Shadow Illusion} @strong{(Sp)}: When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she can create visual illusions. This ability functions as @emph{[silent image],} using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day for every two shadowdancer levels she has attained. The DC for this ability is [Charisma]-based.

@strong{Summon Shadow (Su)}: At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on [Will] saves made to halve the damage from positive channeled energy and the shadow cannot be turned or commanded. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. This shadow has a number of [hit points] equal to half the shadowdancer's total. The shadow uses the shadowdancer's base attack bonus and base save bonuses.

If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 [Fortitude] save. If the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer gains one permanent negative level. A successful saving throw avoids this negative level. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

@strong{Shadow Call (Sp)}: At 4th level, a shadowdancer can create creatures and effects out of raw shadow. This ability functions as @emph{[shadow conjuration],} using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 4th level, plus one additional time per day for every two levels attained beyond 4th (2/day at 6th level, 3/day at 8th level, and 4/day at 10th level). Upon reaching 10th level, this ability functions as @emph{[greater shadow conjuration]}. The DC for this ability is [Charisma]-based.

@strong{Shadow Jump (Su)}: At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a @emph{[dimension door]}spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. A shadowdancer can jump up to a total of 40 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 40 feet or four jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (80 feet at 6th, 160 feet at 8th, and 320 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

@strong{[Defensive Roll] (Ex)}: Starting at 5th level, once per day, a shadowdancer can attempt to avoid a lethal blow. This functions as the rogue's advanced talent of the same name.

@strong{Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)}: At 5th level and higher, shadowdancer can no longer be[flanked]. This defense denies a [rogue] the ability to [sneak attack] the assassin by[flanking] him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has assassin levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum [rogue] level required to[flank] the character.

@strong{Slippery Mind (Ex)}: At 7th level, a shadowdancer becomes resilient to enchantment spells. This functions as the rogue's advanced talent of the same name.

@strong{Shadow Power (Sp)}: At 8th level, a shadowdancer can use raw shadow to damage her foes. This ability functions as @emph{[shadow evocation],} using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day upon reaching 10th level. The DC for this ability is [Charisma]-based.

@strong{Improved Evasion (Ex)}: This ability, gained at 10th level, works like [evasion] (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage. What's more, she takes only half damage even if she fails her saving throw.

@strong{Shadow Master (Su)}: At 10th level, whenever a shadowdancer is in an area of dim light, she gains [DR] 10/--- and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws. In addition, whenever she successfully scores a [critical hit] against a foe who is in an area of dim light, that foe is blinded for 1d6 rounds.

@node Spell Lists
@chapter Spell Lists
@anchor{#spell-lists}
An @textsuperscript{M} or @textsuperscript{F} appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that is not normally included in a spell component pouch.

@strong{Order of Presentation}: In the spell lists and the short descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell's name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

@strong{Hit Dice}: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from classes, still have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

@strong{Caster Level}: A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.

@strong{Creatures and Characters}: The words “creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the short descriptions.

@node How Combat Works
@chapter How Combat Works
@anchor{#how-combat-works}
Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:

​1. When combat begins, all combatants roll initiative.

​2. Determine which characters are aware of their opponents. These characters can act during a surprise round. If all the characters are aware of their opponents, proceed with normal rounds. See the surprise section for more information.

​3. After the surprise round (if any), all combatants are ready to being the first normal round of combat.

​4. Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).

​5. When everyone has had a turn, the next round begins with the combatant with the highest initiative, and steps 3 and 4 repeat until combat ends.
@menu
* The Combat Round::
* Initiative::
* Surprise::
@end menu

@node The Combat Round
@section The Combat Round
@anchor{#the-combat-round}
Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world; there are 10 rounds in a minute of combat. A round normally allows each character involved in a combat situation to act.

Each round's activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result and then proceeds in order. When a character's turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his entire round's worth of actions. (For exceptions, see @ref{#attacks-of-opportunity,Attacks of Opportunity} and @ref{#special-initiative-actions,Special Initiative Actions}.)

When the rules refer to a “full round”, they usually mean a span of time from a particular initiative count in one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.

@node Initiative
@section Initiative
@anchor{#initiative}
At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a [Dexterity] check. Each character applies his or her [Dexterity] modifier to the roll, as well as other modifiers from feats, spells, and other effects. Characters act in order, counting down from the highest result to the lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her initiative changing; see @ref{#special-initiative-actions,Special Initiative Actions}).

If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll to determine which one of them goes before the other.

@strong{Flat-Footed}: At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can't use your [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues of high enough level have the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which means that they cannot be caught flat-footed. Characters with uncanny dodge retain their [Dexterity] bonus to their [AC] and can make attacks of opportunity before they have acted in the first round of combat. A flat-footed character can't make attacks of opportunity, unless he has the [Combat Reflexes] feat.

@strong{Inaction}: Even if you can't take actions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.

@node Surprise
@section Surprise
@anchor{#surprise}
When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you're surprised.

Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.

Determining awareness may call for Perception checks or other checks.

@strong{The Surprise Round}: If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard or move action during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.

@strong{Unaware Combatants}: Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don't get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are [flat-footed] because they have not acted yet, so they lose any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

@node Attack Roll
@section Attack Roll
@anchor{#attack-roll}
An attack roll represents your attempt to strike your opponent on your turn in a round. When you make an attack roll, you roll a d20 and add your attack bonus. (Other modifiers may also apply to this roll.) If your result equals or beats the target's @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, you hit and deal damage.

@strong{Automatic Misses and Hits}: A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on an attack roll is always a miss. A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a hit. A natural 20 is also a threat---a possible critical hit ).

@node Attack Bonus
@section Attack Bonus
@anchor{#attack-bonus}
Your attack bonus with a melee weapon is the following:

@strong{Base attack bonus + [Strength] modifier + size modifier}

With a ranged weapon, your attack bonus is the following:

@strong{Base attack bonus + [Dexterity] modifier + size modifier + range penalty}

@node Armor Class
@section Armor Class
@anchor{#armor-class}
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how hard it is for opponents to land a solid, damaging blow on you. It's the attack roll result that an opponent needs to achieve to hit you. Your AC is equal to the following:

@strong{10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + [Dexterity] modifier + other modifiers}

Note that armor limits your [Dexterity] bonus, so if you're wearing armor, you might not be able to apply your whole [Dexterity] bonus to your AC (see [Table: Armor and Shields]).

Sometimes you can't use your [Dexterity] bonus (if you have one). If you can't react to a blow, you can't use your [Dexterity] bonus to AC. If you don't have a [Dexterity] bonus, your AC does not change.

@strong{Other Modifiers}: Many other factors modify your AC.

@emph{Enhancement Bonuses}: Enhancement bonuses apply to your armor to increase the armor bonus it provides.

@emph{Deflection Bonus}: Magical deflection effects ward off attacks and improve your AC.

@emph{Natural Armor}: If your race has a tough hide, scales, or thick skin you receive a bonus to your AC.

@emph{Dodge Bonuses}: Dodge bonuses represent actively avoiding blows. Any situation that denies you your [Dexterity] bonus also denies you dodge bonuses. (Wearing armor, however, does not limit these bonuses the way it limits a [Dexterity] bonus to AC.) Unlike most sorts of bonuses, dodge bonuses stack with each other.

@emph{Size Modifier}: You receive a bonus or penalty to your AC based on your size. See Table: Size Modifiers.

@strong{Touch Attacks}: Some attacks completely disregard armor, including shields and natural armor---the aggressor need only touch a foe for such an attack to take full effect. In these cases, the attacker makes a touch attack roll (either ranged or melee). When you are the target of a touch attack, your AC doesn't include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. All other modifiers, such as your size modifier, [Dexterity] modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) apply normally. Some creatures have the ability to make [incorporeal] touch attacks. These attacks bypass solid objects, such as armor and shields, by passing through them. [Incorporeal] touch attacks work similarly to normal touch attacks except that they also ignore cover bonuses. [Incorporeal] touch attacks do not ignore armor bonuses granted by force effects, such as @emph{mage armor} and @emph{bracers of armor}.

@node Damage
@section Damage
@anchor{#damage}
If your attack succeeds, you deal damage. The type of weapon used determines the amount of damage you deal.

Damage reduces a target's current hit points.

@strong{Minimum Damage}: If penalties reduce the damage result to less than 1, a hit still deals 1 point of [nonlethal damage].

@strong{[Strength] Bonus}: When you hit with a melee or thrown weapon, including a sling, add your [Strength] modifier to the damage result. A [Strength] penalty, but not a bonus, applies on damage rolls made with a bow that is not a composite bow.

@emph{Off-Hand Weapon}: When you deal damage with a weapon in your off hand, you add only 1/2 your [Strength] bonus. If you have a [Strength] penalty, the entire penalty applies.

@emph{Wielding a Weapon Two-Handed}: When you deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding two-handed, you add 1-1/2 times your [Strength] bonus penalties are not multiplied). You don't get this higher [Strength] bonus, however, when using a light weapon with two hands.

@strong{Multiplying Damage}: Sometimes you multiply damage by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll the damage (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results.

@emph{Note}: When you multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied damage. So if you are asked to double the damage twice, the end result is three times the normal damage.

@emph{Exception}: Extra damage dice over and above a weapon's normal damage are never multiplied.

@strong{Ability Damage}: Certain creatures and magical effects can cause temporary or permanent [ability damage] (a reduction to an ability score).

@node Hit Points
@section Hit Points
@anchor{#hit-points}
When your hit point total reaches 0, you're disabled. When it reaches --1, you're [dying]. When it gets to a negative amount equal to your [Constitution] score, you're dead. See @ref{#injury-and-death,Injury and Death}, for more information.

@node Attacks of Opportunity
@section Attacks of Opportunity
@anchor{#attacks-of-opportunity}
Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down or takes a reckless action. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity. See the Attacks of Opportunity diagram for an example of how they work.

@strong{Threatened Squares}: You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you're unarmed, you don't normally threaten any squares and thus can't make attacks of opportunity.

@emph{Reach Weapons}: Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.

@strong{Provoking an Attack of Opportunity}: Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square and performing certain actions within a threatened square.

@emph{Moving}: Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack---the 5-foot step and the withdraw action.

@emph{Performing a Distracting Act}: Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table: Actions in Combat notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.

Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.

@strong{Making an Attack of Opportunity}: An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and most characters can only make one per round. You don't have to make an attack of opportunity if you don't want to. You make your attack of opportunity at your normal attack bonus, even if you've already attacked in the round.

An attack of opportunity “interrupts” the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character's turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character's turn).

@emph{Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity}: If you have the [Combat Reflexes] feat, you can add your [Dexterity] modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn't count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.

In this combat, the fighter and the sorcerer fight an ogre and his goblin buddy.@ #1: The fighter can safely approach this way without provoking an attack of opportunity, as he does not pass through a square threatened by the ogre (who has 10 feet of reach) or the goblin.@ #2: If the fighter approaches this way, he provokes two attacks of opportunity since he passes through a square both creatures threaten. #3: The sorcerer moves away using a withdraw action. The first square she leaves is not threatened as a result, and she can thus move away from the goblin safely, but when she leaves the second square, she provokes an attack of opportunity from the ogre (who has 10 feet of reach). She could instead limit her movement to a 5-foot step, as a free action, and not provoke any attacks of opportunity.

@node Speed
@section Speed
@anchor{#speed}
Your speed tells you how far you can move in a round and still do something, such as attack or cast a spell. Your speed depends mostly on your size and your armor.

Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have a speed of 20 feet (4 squares), or 15 feet (3 squares) when wearing medium or heavy armor (except for dwarves, who move 20 feet in any armor).

Humans, elves, half-elves, half-orcs, and most humanoid monsters have a speed of 30 feet (6 squares), or 20 feet (4 squares) in medium or heavy armor.

If you use two move actions in a round (sometimes called a “double move” action), you can move up to double your speed. If you spend the entire round running, you can move up to quadruple your speed (or triple if you are in heavy armor).

@node Saving Throws
@section Saving Throws
@anchor{#saving-throws}
Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect. Like an attack roll, a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your class and level ), and an associated ability score. Your saving throw modifier is:

@strong{Base save bonus + ability modifier}

@strong{Saving Throw Types}: The three different kinds of saving throws are [Fortitude], [Reflex], and [Will]:

@emph{Fortitude}: These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health. Apply your [Constitution] modifier to your Fortitude saving throws.

@emph{Reflex}: These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks and unexpected situations. Apply your [Dexterity] modifier to your Reflex saving throws.

@emph{Will}: These saves reflect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your [Wisdom] modifier to your Will saving throws.

@strong{Saving Throw Difficulty Class}: The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.

@strong{Automatic Failures and Successes}: A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see [Items Surviving after a Saving Throw]). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.

@node Action Types
@section Action Types
@anchor{#action-types}
An action's type essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within the framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated. There are six types of actions: standard actions, move actions, full-round actions, swift actions, immediate actions, and free actions.

In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can perform a full-round action. You can also perform one swift action and one or more free actions. You can always take a move action in place of a standard action.

In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.

@strong{Standard Action}: A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly to make an attack or cast a spell. See Table: Actions in Combat for other standard actions.

@strong{Move Action}: A move action allows you to move up to your speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time. See Table: Actions in Combat for other move actions.

You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your move action for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either before, during, or after the action.

@strong{Full-Round Action}: A full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only movement you can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. You can also perform free actions and swift actions (see below). See Table: Actions in Combat for a list of full-round actions.

Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.

Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations when you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions detail which actions allow this option.

@strong{Free Action}: Free actions consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform one or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there are reasonable limits on what you can really do for free, as decided by the GM.

@strong{Swift Action}: A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform only a single swift action per turn.

@strong{Immediate Action}: An immediate action is very similar to a swift action, but can be performed at any time---even if it's not your turn.

@strong{Not an Action}: Some activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions. They literally don't take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else, such as nocking an arrow as part of an attack with a bow.

@strong{Restricted Activity}: In some situations, you may be unable to take a full round's worth of actions. In such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single move action (plus free and swift actions as normal). You can't take a full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a standard action; see below).

@node Attack
@subsection Attack
@anchor{#attack}
Making an attack is a standard action.

@strong{Melee Attacks}: With a normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet. (Opponents within 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee weapons have reach, as indicated in their descriptions. With a typical reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can't strike adjacent foes (those within 5 feet).

@strong{Unarmed Attacks}: Striking for damage with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking with a melee weapon, except for the following:

@emph{Attacks of Opportunity}: Attacking unarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you attack, provided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before your attack. An unarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity from other foes, nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an unarmed foe.

An unarmed character can't take attacks of opportunity (but see “Armed” Unarmed Attacks, below).

@emph{“Armed” Unarmed Attacks}: Sometimes a character's or creature's unarmed attack counts as an armed attack. A monk, a character with the [Improved Unarmed Strike] feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural physical weapons all count as being armed (see natural attacks).

Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make attacks of opportunity).

@emph{Unarmed Strike Damage}: An unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage (plus your [Strength] modifier, as normal). A Small character's unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of bludgeoning damage, while a Large character's unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage. All damage from unarmed strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes count as light weapons (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).

@emph{Dealing Lethal Damage}: You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before you make your attack roll, but you take a --4 penalty on your attack roll. If you have the [Improved Unarmed Strike] feat, you can deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike without taking a penalty on the attack roll.

@strong{Ranged Attacks}: With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon's maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown weapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons, it is 10 range increments. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in their descriptions.

@strong{Natural Attacks}: Attacks made with natural weapons, such as claws and bites, are melee attacks that can be made against any creature within your reach (usually 5 feet). These attacks are made using your full attack bonus and deal an amount of damage that depends on their type (plus your [Strength] modifier, as normal). You do not receive additional natural attacks for a high base attack bonus. Instead, you receive additional attack rolls for multiple limb and body parts capable of making the attack (as noted by the race or ability that grants the attacks). If you possess only one natural attack (such as a bite---two claw attacks do not qualify), you add 1--1/2 times your [Strength] bonus on damage rolls made with that attack.

Some natural attacks are denoted as secondary natural attacks, such as tails and wings. Attacks with secondary natural attacks are made using your base attack bonus minus 5. These attacks deal an amount of damage depending on their type, but you only add half your [Strength] modifier on damage rolls.

You can make attacks with natural weapons in combination with attacks made with a melee weapon and unarmed strikes, so long as a different limb is used for each attack. For example, you cannot make a claw attack and also use that hand to make attacks with a longsword. When you make additional attacks in this way, all of your natural attacks are treated as secondary natural attacks, using your base attack bonus minus 5 and adding only 1/2 of your [Strength] modifier on damage rolls. Feats such as @ref{#two-weapon-fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting} and Multiattack can reduce these penalties.

@strong{Multiple Attacks}: A character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full-attack action (see Full-Round Actions) in order to get more than one attack.

@strong{Shooting or Throwing into a Melee}: If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a --4 penalty on your attack roll. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An [unconscious] or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)

If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the --4 penalty, even if the creature you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.

If your target is two size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with, this penalty is reduced to --2. There is no penalty for firing at a creature that is three size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with.

@emph{Precise Shot}: If you have the [Precise Shot] feat, you don't take this penalty.

@strong{Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action}: You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do so, you take a --4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 [dodge bonus] to [AC] until the start of your next turn.

@strong{Critical Hits}: When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit regardless of your target's @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, and you have scored a “threat,” meaning the hit might be a critical hit (or “crit”). To find out if it's a critical hit, you immediately make an attempt to “confirm” the critical hit---another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the confirmation roll also results in a hit against the target's [AC], your original hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit, it doesn't need to come up 20 again.) If the confirmation roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.

A critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat range for a critical hit on an attack roll is 20, and the multiplier is ×2.

@emph{Exception}: Precision damage (such as from a rogue's sneak attack class feature) and additional damage dice from special weapon qualities (such as @emph{flaming}) are not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

@emph{Increased Threat Range}: Sometimes your threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a lower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit. Any attack roll that doesn't result in a hit is not a threat.

@emph{Increased Critical Multiplier}: Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical hit (see [Equipment]).

@emph{Spells and Critical Hits}: A spell that requires an attack roll can score a critical hit. A spell attack that requires no attack roll cannot score a critical hit. If a spell causes ability damage or drain (see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities}), the damage or drain is doubled on a critical hit.

@node Activate Magic Item
@subsection Activate Magic Item
@anchor{#activate-magic-item}
Many magic items don't need to be activated. Certain magic items, however, do need to be activated, especially potions, scrolls, wands, rods, and staffs. Unless otherwise noted, activating a magic item is a standard action.

@strong{Spell Completion Items}: Activating a [spell completion item] is the equivalent of casting a spell. It requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. You lose the spell if your concentration is broken, and you can attempt to activate the item while on the defensive, as with casting a spell.

@strong{Spell Trigger, Command Word, or Use-Activated Items}: Activating any of these kinds of items does not require concentration and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@node Cast a Spell
@subsection Cast a Spell
@anchor{#cast-a-spell}
Most spells require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a move action.

@emph{Note}: You retain your [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] while casting.

@strong{Spell Components}: To cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a firm voice. If you're gagged or in the area of a @emph{silence}spell, you can't cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been [deafened] has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.

To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at least one hand. You can't cast a spell of this type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.

To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as described by the spell. Unless these components are elaborate, preparing them is a free action. For material components and focuses whose costs are not listed in the spell description, you can assume that you have them if you have your spell component pouch.

@strong{Concentration}: You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you can't concentrate, you can't cast a spell. If you start casting a spell but something interferes with your concentration, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The check's DC depends on what is threatening your concentration (see [Magic]). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from preparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells even though you did not cast it successfully.

@strong{Concentrating to Maintain a Spell}: Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the spell ends.

@strong{Casting Time}: Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes effect.

@strong{Attacks of Opportunity}: Generally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from threatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + the spell's level) or lose the spell. Spells that require only a free action to cast don't provoke attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Casting on the Defensive}: Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It does, however, require a concentration check (DC 15 + double the spell's level) to successfully cast the spell. Failure means that you lose the spell.

@strong{Touch Spells in Combat}: Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the subject. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or attempt to touch) as a free action. You may take your move before casting the spell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an attack roll.

@emph{Touch Attacks}: Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The act of casting a spell, however, does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types: melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score critical hits with either type of attack as long as the spell deals damage. Your opponent's [AC] against a touch attack does not include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier, [Dexterity] modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.

@emph{Holding the Charge}: If you don't discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can hold the charge indefinitely. You can continue to make touch attacks round after round. If you touch anything or anyone while holding a charge, even unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates. You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. Alternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding a charge. In this case, you aren't considered armed and you provoke attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. If your unarmed attack or natural weapon attack normally doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, neither does this attack. If the attack hits, you deal normal damage for your unarmed attack or natural weapon and the spell discharges. If the attack misses, you are still holding the charge.

@strong{Ranged Touch Spells in Combat}: Some spells allow you to make a ranged touch attack as part of the casting of the spell. These attacks are made as part of the spell and do not require a separate action. Ranged touch attacks provoke an attack of opportunity, even if the spell that causes the attacks was cast defensively. Unless otherwise noted, ranged touch attacks cannot be held until a later turn.

@strong{Dismiss a Spell}: Dismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

@node Start/Complete Full-Round Action
@subsection Start/Complete Full-Round Action
@anchor{#startcomplete-full-round-action}

@verbatim
{#start-complete-full-round-action}
@end verbatim

The “start full-round action” standard action lets you start undertaking a full-round action, which you can complete in the following round by using another standard action. You can't use this action to start or complete a full attack, charge, run, or withdraw.

@node Total Defense
@subsection Total Defense
@anchor{#total-defense}
You can defend yourself as a standard action. You get a +4 [dodge bonus] to your [AC] for 1 round. Your [AC] improves at the start of this action. You can't combine total defense with fighting defensively or with the benefit of the [Combat Expertise] feat. You can't make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.

@node Use Special Ability
@subsection Use Special Ability
@anchor{#use-special-ability}
Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but whether it is a standard action, a full-round action, or not an action at all is defined by the ability.

@strong{Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)}: Using a spell-like ability works like casting a spell in that it requires concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. Spell-like abilities can be disrupted. If your concentration is broken, the attempt to use the ability fails, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability. The casting time of a spell-like ability is 1 standard action, unless the ability description notes otherwise.

@emph{Using a Spell-Like Ability on the Defensive}: You may attempt to use a spell-like ability on the defensive, just as with casting a spell. If the concentration check (DC 15 + double the spell's level) fails, you can't use the ability, but the attempt counts as if you had used the ability.

@strong{Supernatural Abilities (Su)}: Using a supernatural ability is usually a standard action (unless defined otherwise by the ability's description). Its use cannot be disrupted, does not require concentration, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)}: Using an extraordinary ability is usually not an action because most extraordinary abilities automatically happen in a reactive fashion. Those extraordinary abilities that are actions are usually standard actions that cannot be disrupted, do not require concentration, and do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@node Move
@subsection Move
@anchor{#move}
The simplest move action is moving your speed. If you take this kind of move action during your turn, you can't also take a 5-foot step.

Many nonstandard modes of movement are covered under this category, including climbing (up to one-quarter of your speed) and swimming (up to one-quarter of your speed).

@strong{Accelerated Climbing}: You can climb at half your speed as a move action by accepting a --5 penalty on your Climb check.

@strong{Crawling}: You can crawl 5 feet as a move action. Crawling incurs attacks of opportunity from any attackers who threaten you at any point of your crawl. A crawling character is considered [prone] and must take a move action to stand up, provoking an attack of opportunity.

@node Direct or Redirect a Spell
@subsection Direct or Redirect a Spell
@anchor{#direct-or-redirect-a-spell}
Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell requires a move action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity or require concentration.

@node Draw or Sheathe a Weapon
@subsection Draw or Sheathe a Weapon
@anchor{#draw-or-sheathe-a-weapon}
Drawing a weapon so that you can use it in combat, or putting it away so that you have a free hand, requires a move action. This action also applies to weapon-like objects carried in easy reach, such as wands. If your weapon or weapon-like object is stored in a pack or otherwise out of easy reach, treat this action as retrieving a stored item.

If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you may draw a weapon as a free action combined with a regular move. If you have the @ref{#two-weapon-fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting} feat, you can draw two light or one-handed weapons in the time it would normally take you to draw one.

Drawing ammunition for use with a ranged weapon (such as arrows, bolts, sling bullets, or shuriken) is a free action.

@node Manipulate an Item
@subsection Manipulate an Item
@anchor{#manipulate-an-item}
Moving or manipulating an item is usually a move action.

This includes retrieving or putting away a stored item, picking up an item, moving a heavy object, and opening a door. Examples of this kind of action, along with whether they incur an attack of opportunity, are given in Table: Actions in Combat.

@node Mount/Dismount a Steed
@subsection Mount/Dismount a Steed
@anchor{#mountdismount-a-steed}
Mounting or dismounting a steed requires a move action.

@strong{Fast Mount or Dismount}: You can mount or dismount as a free action with a DC 20 Ride check. If you fail the check, mounting or dismounting is a move action instead. You can't attempt a fast mount or fast dismount unless you can perform the mount or dismount as a move action in the current round.

@node Ready or Drop a Shield
@subsection Ready or Drop a Shield
@anchor{#ready-or-drop-a-shield}
Strapping a shield to your arm to gain its shield bonus to your [AC], or unstrapping and dropping a shield so you can use your shield hand for another purpose, requires a move action. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can ready or drop a shield as a free action combined with a regular move.

Dropping a carried (but not worn) shield is a free action.

@node Stand Up
@subsection Stand Up
@anchor{#stand-up}
Standing up from a [prone] position requires a move action and provokes attacks of opportunity.

@node Full-Round Actions
@section Full-Round Actions
@anchor{#full-round-actions}
A full-round action requires an entire round to complete. Thus, it can't be coupled with a standard or a move action, though if it does not involve moving any distance, you can take a 5-foot step.

@node Full Attack
@subsection Full Attack
@anchor{#full-attack}
If you get more than one attack per round because your base attack bonus is high enough (see Base Attack Bonus in @ref{#classes,Classes}), because you fight with two weapons or a double weapon, or for some special reason, you must use a full-round action to get your additional attacks. You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.

The only movement you can take during a full attack is a 5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or between your attacks.

If you get multiple attacks because your base attack bonus is high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest bonus to lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with either weapon first. If you are using a double weapon, you can strike with either part of the weapon first.

@strong{Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack}: After your first attack, you can decide to take a move action instead of making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack turns out and assuming you have not already taken a move action this round. If you've already taken a 5-foot step, you can't use your move action to move any distance, but you could still use a different kind of move action.

@strong{Fighting Defensively as a Full-Round Action}: You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full-attack action. If you do so, you take a --4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 [dodge bonus] to [AC] for until the start your next turn.

@node Cast a Spell
@subsection Cast a Spell
@anchor{#cast-a-spell-1}
A spell that takes one round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.

A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.

When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration from 1 round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration after starting the spell and before it is complete, you lose the spell.

You only provoke attacks of opportunity when you begin casting a spell, even though you might continue casting for at least 1 full round. While casting a spell, you don't threaten any squares around you.

This action is otherwise identical to the cast a spell action described under Standard Actions.

@strong{Casting a Metamagic Spell}: Sorcerers and bards must take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than a regular spell. If a spell's normal casting time is 1 standard action, casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard (except for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which take 1 swift action to cast). Note that this isn't the same as a spell with a 1-round casting time. Spells that take a full-round action to cast take effect in the same round that you begin casting, and you are not required to continue the invocations, gestures, and concentration until your next turn. For spells with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the metamagic spell.

Clerics and druids must take more time to spontaneously cast a metamagic version of a cure, inflict, or summon spell. Spontaneously casting a metamagic version of a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action is a full-round action, and spells with longer casting times take an extra full-round action to cast.

@node Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain
@subsection Move 5 Feet through Difficult Terrain
@anchor{#move-5-feet-through-difficult-terrain}

@verbatim
{#move-5-feet-through-difficult-terrain-111}
@end verbatim

In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don't have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (a single square). In such a case, you may spend a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it's not, and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally.

@node Run
@subsection Run
@anchor{#run-1}
You can run as a full-round action. If you do, you do not also get a 5-foot step. When you run, you can move up to four times your speed in a straight line (or three times your speed if you're in heavy armor). You lose any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] unless you have the @ref{#run,Run} feat.

You can run for a number of rounds equal to your [Constitution] score, but after that you must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check to continue running. You must check again each round in which you continue to run, and the DC of this check increases by 1 for each check you have made. When you fail this check, you must stop running. A character who has run to his limit must rest for 1 minute (10 rounds) before running again. During a rest period, a character can move no faster than a normal move action.

You can't run across difficult terrain or if you can't see where you're going.

A run represents a speed of about 13 miles per hour for an unencumbered human.

@node Use Special Ability
@subsection @ref{#use-special-ability,Use Special Ability}
@anchor{#use-special-ability-1}
Using a special ability is usually a standard action, but some may be full-round actions, as defined by the ability.

@node Withdraw
@subsection Withdraw
@anchor{#withdraw}
Withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action. When you withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against you when you move from that square. [Invisible] enemies still get attacks of opportunity against you, and you can't withdraw from combat if you're blinded. You can't take a 5-foot step during the same round in which you withdraw.

If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a threatened square (other than the one you started in), enemies get attacks of opportunity as normal.

You may not withdraw using a form of movement for which you don't have a listed speed.

Note that despite the name of this action, you don't actually have to leave combat entirely.

@strong{Restricted Withdraw}: If you are limited to taking only a standard action each round you can withdraw as a standard action. In this case, you may move up to your speed.

@node Free Actions
@section Free Actions

Free actions don't take any time at all, though there may be limits to the number of free actions you can perform in a turn. Free actions rarely incur attacks of opportunity. Some common free actions are described below.

@node Drop Prone
@subsection Drop Prone
@anchor{#drop-prone}
Dropping to a [prone] position in your space is a free action.

@node Speak

In general, speaking is a free action that you can perform even when it isn't your turn. Speaking more than a few sentences is generally beyond the limit of a free action.

@node Swift Actions
@section Swift Actions
@anchor{#swift-actions}
A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action. You can, however, perform only one single swift action per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action anytime you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve spellcasting, activating a feat, or the activation of magic items.
@menu
* Cast a Quickened Spell::
@end menu

@node Cast a Quickened Spell
@subsection Cast a Quickened Spell
@anchor{#cast-a-quickened-spell}
You can cast a quickened spell (see the Quicken Spell feat), or any spell whose casting time is designated as a free or swift action, as a swift action. Only one such spell can be cast in any round, and such spells don't count toward your normal limit of one spell per round. Casting a spell as a swift action doesn't incur an attack of opportunity.

@node Immediate Actions
@section Immediate Actions
@anchor{#immediate-actions}
Much like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount of time but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any time---even if it's not your turn. Casting @emph{feather fall} is an immediate action, since the spell can be cast at any time.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are [flat-footed].

@anchor{#take-5-foot-step}
You can move 5 feet in any round when you don't perform any other kind of movement. Taking this 5-foot step never provokes an attack of opportunity. You can't take more than one 5-foot step in a round, and you can't take a 5-foot step in the same round that you move any distance.

You can take a 5-foot step before, during, or after your other actions in the round.

You can only take a 5-foot-step if your movement isn't hampered by difficult terrain or darkness. Any creature with a speed of 5 feet or less can't take a 5-foot step, since moving even 5 feet requires a move action for such a slow creature.

You may not take a 5-foot step using a form of movement for which you do not have a listed speed.

@node Use Feat

@node Loss of Hit Points
@section Loss of Hit Points
@anchor{#loss-of-hit-points}
The most common way that your character gets hurt is to take lethal damage and lose hit points.

@strong{What Hit Points Represent}: Hit points mean two things in the game world: the ability to take physical punishment and keep going, and the ability to turn a serious blow into a less serious one.

@strong{Effects of Hit Point Damage}: Damage doesn't slow you down until your current hit points reach 0 or lower. At 0 hit points, you're disabled.

If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your [Constitution] score, you are [unconscious] and [dying].

When your negative hit point total is equal to your [Constitution], you're dead.

@strong{Massive Damage (Optional Rule)}: If you ever sustain a single attack that deals an amount of damage equal to half your total hit points (minimum 50 points of damage) or more and it doesn't kill you outright, you must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. If this saving throw fails, you die regardless of your current hit points. If you take half your total hit points or more in damage from multiple attacks, no one of which dealt more than half your total hit points (minimum 50), the massive damage rule does not apply.

@node Disabled 0 Hit Points
@section Disabled (0 Hit Points)
@anchor{#disabled-0-hit-points}
When your current hit point total drops to exactly 0, you are disabled.

You gain the [staggered] condition and can only take a single move or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can you take full-round actions). You can take move actions without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other strenuous action) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. Unless your activity increased your hit points, you are now at --1 hit points and [dying].

Healing that raises your hit points above 0 makes you fully functional again, just as if you'd never been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.

You can also become disabled when recovering from [dying]. In this case, it's a step toward recovery, and you can have fewer than 0 hit points (see [Stable] Characters and Recovery).

@node Dying Negative Hit Points
@section Dying (Negative Hit Points)
@anchor{#dying-negative-hit-points}
If your hit point total is negative, but not equal to or greater than your [Constitution] score, you're dying.

A dying character immediately falls [unconscious] and can take no actions.

A dying character loses 1 hit point every round. This continues until the character dies or becomes [stable].

@node Dead
@section Dead
@anchor{#dead}
When your character's current hit points drop to a negative amount equal to his [Constitution] score or lower, or if he succumbs to massive damage, he's dead. A character can also die from taking ability damage or suffering an ability drain that reduces his [Constitution] score to 0 (see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities}).

Certain types of powerful magic, such as @emph{raise dead} and @emph{resurrection}, can restore life to a dead character. See [Magic] for more information.

@node Stable Characters and Recovery
@section Stable Characters and Recovery
@anchor{#stable-characters-and-recovery}
On the character's next turn, after being reduced to negative hit points (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check to become [stable]. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is [stable] does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. An [unconscious] or [dying] character cannot use any special action that changes the initiative count on which his action occurs.

Characters taking continuous damage, such as from an @emph{acid arrow} or a bleed effect, automatically fail all [Constitution] checks made to stabilize. Such characters lose 1 hit point per round in addition to the continuous damage.

You can keep a [dying] character from losing any more hit points and make him [stable] with a DC 15 Heal check.

If any sort of healing cures the [dying] character of even 1 point of damage, he becomes [stable] and stops losing hit points.

Healing that raises the [dying] character's hit points to 0 makes him conscious and disabled. Healing that raises his hit points to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he'd never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 hit points.

A [stable] character who has been tended by a healer or who has been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit points naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.

@strong{Recovering with Help}: One hour after a tended, [dying] character becomes [stable], the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check to become conscious. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Conscious characters with negative hit point totals are treated as [disabled characters]. If the character remains [unconscious], he receives another check every hour to regain consciousness. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. Even if [unconscious], the character recovers hit points naturally. He automatically regains consciousness when his hit points rise to 1 or higher.

@strong{Recovering without Help}: A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance of recovering on his own. Treat such characters as those attempting to recover with help, but every failed [Constitution] check to regain consciousness results in the loss of 1 hit point. An unaided character does not recover hit points naturally. Once conscious, the character can make a DC 10 [Constitution] check once per day, after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become [unconscious]. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing hit points naturally.

@node Healing
@section Healing
@anchor{#healing}
After taking damage, you can recover hit points through natural healing or through magical healing. In any case, you can't regain hit points past your full normal hit point total.

@strong{Natural Healing}: With a full night's rest (8 hours of sleep or more), you recover 1 hit point per character level. Any significant interruption during your rest prevents you from healing that night.

If you undergo complete bed rest for an entire day and night, you recover twice your character level in hit points.

@strong{Magical Healing}: Various abilities and spells can restore hit points.

@strong{Healing Limits}: You can never recover more hit points than you lost. Magical healing won't raise your current hit points higher than your full normal hit point total.

@strong{Healing Ability Damage}: Temporary ability damage returns at the rate of 1 point per night of rest (8 hours) for each affected ability score. Complete bed rest restores 2 points per day (24 hours) for each affected ability score.

@node Temporary Hit Points
@section Temporary Hit Points
@anchor{#temporary-hit-points}
Certain effects give a character temporary hit points. These hit points are in addition to the character's current hit point total and any damage taken by the character is subtracted from these hit points first. Any damage in excess of a character's temporary hit points is applied to his current hit points as normal. If the effect that grants the temporary hit points ends or is dispelled, any remaining temporary hit points go away. The damage they sustained is not transferred to the character's current hit points.

When temporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as real hit points can be, even by magic.

@strong{Increases in [Constitution] Score and Current Hit Points}: An increase in a character's [Constitution] score, even a temporary one, can give her more hit points (an effective hit point increase), but these are not temporary hit points. They can be restored, and they are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

@node Nonlethal Damage
@section Nonlethal Damage
@anchor{#nonlethal-damage}
Nonlethal damage represents harm to a character that is not life-threatening. Unlike normal damage, nonlethal damage is healed quickly with rest.

@strong{Dealing Nonlethal Damage}: Certain attacks deal nonlethal damage. Other effects, such as heat or being [exhausted], also deal nonlethal damage. When you take nonlethal damage, keep a running total of how much you've accumulated. Do not deduct the nonlethal damage number from your current hit points. It is not “real” damage. Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you're [staggered] (see below), and when it exceeds your current hit points, you fall [unconscious].

@emph{Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Lethal Damage}: You can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, but you take a --4 penalty on your attack roll.

@emph{Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage}: You can use a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a --4 penalty on your attack roll.

@strong{Staggered and Unconscious}: When your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you're [staggered]. You can only take a standard action or a move action in each round (in addition to free, immediate, and swift actions). You cease being [staggered] when your current hit points once again exceed your nonlethal damage.

When your nonlethal damage exceeds your current hit points, you fall [unconscious]. While [unconscious], you are [helpless].

Spellcasters who fall [unconscious] retain any spellcasting ability they had before going [unconscious].

If a creature's nonlethal damage is equal to his total maximum hit points (not his current hit points), all further nonlethal damage is treated as lethal damage. This does not apply to creatures with regeneration. Such creatures simply accrue additional nonlethal damage, increasing the amount of time they remain [unconscious].

@strong{Healing Nonlethal Damage}: You heal nonlethal damage at the rate of 1 hit point per hour per character level. When a spell or ability cures hit point damage, it also removes an equal amount of nonlethal damage.

Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can't run or charge across difficult terrain.

If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.

Flying and [incorporeal] creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.

@strong{Obstacles}: Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn't completely block it, each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the obstacle, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don't have sufficient movement to cross the obstacle and move into the square on the other side, you can't cross it. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.

On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can't move through a blocking obstacle.

Flying and [incorporeal] creatures are able to avoid most obstacles.

@strong{Squeezing}: In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn't as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a --4 penalty on attack rolls and a --4 penalty to [AC].

When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that's 1 square wide, the creature's miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.

A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can't end its movement in an occupied square.

To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space's width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can't attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a --4 penalty to [AC], and you lose any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

@node Special Movement Rules
@section Special Movement Rules
@anchor{#special-movement-rules}
These rules cover special movement situations.

@strong{Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space}: Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it's not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there's a legal position that's closer.

@strong{Double Movement Cost}: When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares (just as two diagonal moves normally do).

If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.

@strong{Minimum Movement}: Despite whatever penalties to movement you might have, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn't allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn't a 5-foot step).

The fighter's first move costs him 5 feet (or 1 square). His next costs 5 feet also, but his third (his 2nd diagonal) costs him 10 feet. Next he moves into difficult terrain, also costing him 10 feet. At this point , the fighter has moved 30 feet---one move action. The last square is a diagonal move in difficult terrain, which costs 15 feet; he must spend his turn's standard action to move this far.@ The Large ogre's move costs a total of 20 feet worth of movement (or 4 squares). The ogre cannot cut across the corner to get to that location, and must fully move around it, as indicated.

* These values are typical for creatures of the indicated size. Some exceptions exist.

Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.

@strong{Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures}: Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space. This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. 25 Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can't reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent's square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can't flank an enemy.

@strong{Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures}: Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.

Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren't in adjacent squares.

Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.

Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can't strike at their natural reach or less.

@node Cover
@section Cover
@anchor{#cover}
To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to [AC]).

When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from any corner of your square to the target's square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.

@strong{Low Obstacles and Cover}: A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he's closer to the obstacle than his target.

@strong{Cover and Attacks of Opportunity}: You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.

@strong{Cover and Reflex Saves}: Cover grants you a +2 bonus on [Reflex] saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.

@strong{Cover and Stealth Checks}: You can use cover to make a Stealth check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Stealth check.

@strong{Soft Cover}: Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to [AC]. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on [Reflex] saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check.

@strong{Big Creatures and Cover}: Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.

@strong{Partial Cover}: If a creature has cover, but more than half the creature is visible, its cover bonus is reduced to a +2 to [AC] and a +1 bonus on [Reflex] saving throws. This partial cover is subject to the GM's discretion.

@strong{Total Cover}: If you don't have line of effect to your target (that is, you cannot draw any line from your square to your target's square without crossing a solid barrier), he is considered to have total cover from you. You can't make an attack against a target that has total cover.

@strong{Improved Cover}: In some cases, such as attacking a target hiding behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to [AC] and [Reflex] saves. In such situations, the normal cover bonuses to [AC] and [Reflex] saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the [Reflex] save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Stealth checks.

#1: The fighter is adjacent to the ogre, and nothing blocks him from reaching it. The ogre does not have cover against the fighter.@ #2: The rogue is adjacent to the ogre, but lines from the corners of her square to the corners of the ogre's square cross through a wall. The ogre has melee cover from her, but if it attacks her, the rogue does not have cover from it, as the ogre has reach (so it figures attacks as if attacking with a ranged weapon).@ #3: The cleric attacks at range, and must pick one of the corners of her square to determine cover. Some of these lines pass through a solid surface, meaning that the ogre has cover.@ #4: The sorcerer attacks at range as well, but her lines reveal that she can clearly see more than half of the ogre. This gives the ogre partial cover.

@node Concealment
@section Concealment
@anchor{#concealment}
To determine whether your target has concealment from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target's square passes through a square or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment.

When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that isn't adjacent to you, use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.

In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.

@strong{Concealment Miss Chance}: Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment. Make the attack normally---if the attacker hits, the defender must make a miss chance d% roll to avoid being struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.

@strong{Concealment and Stealth Checks}: You can use concealment to make a Stealth check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Stealth check.

@strong{Total Concealment}: If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight, he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can't attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).

You can't execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.

@strong{Ignoring Concealment}: Concealment isn't always effective. An area of dim lighting or darkness doesn't provide any concealment against an opponent with darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a greater distance than other characters with the same light source. Although @emph{invisibility} provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make Perception checks to notice the location of an [invisible] character. An [invisible] character gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on Stealth checks when not moving (even though opponents can't see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual or auditory clues).

@strong{Varying Degrees of Concealment}: Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.

@node Flanking
@section Flanking
@anchor{#flanking}
When making a melee attack, you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by another enemy character or creature on its opposite border or opposite corner.

When in doubt about whether two characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two attackers' centers. If the line passes through opposite borders of the opponent's space (including corners of those borders), then the opponent is flanked.

@emph{Exception}: If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.

Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.

Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can't flank an opponent.

#1: The fighter and the cleric are flanking the ogre because they can draw a line to each other that passes through opposite sides of the ogre. Both the fighter and the cleric receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against the ogre.@ #2: The rogue is not flanking the ogre because she cannot draw a line to the fighter or the cleric that passes through opposite sides of the ogre. The rogue cannot draw a line to the sorcerer because the sorcerer is not adjacent to the ogre and does not threaten it.@*#3: The goblin and the ogre flank the sorcerer, as they can draw a line between them that passes through opposite sides of the sorcerer's square. If the ogre didn't have reach to the sorcerer, though, he and the goblin would not be flanking her.

@node Helpless Defenders
@section Helpless Defenders
@anchor{#helpless-defenders}
A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, [paralyzed], [unconscious], or otherwise at your mercy.

@strong{Regular Attack}: A [helpless] character takes a --4 penalty to [AC] against melee attacks. In addition, a [helpless] character is treated as having a [Dexterity] of 0, giving him a --5 penalty to [AC] against both melee and ranged attacks (for a total of --9 against melee and --5 against ranged). A [helpless] character is also [flat-footed].

@strong{Coup de Grace}: As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace (pronounced “coo day grahs”) to a [helpless] opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target.

You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a [Fortitude] save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a [helpless] opponent when delivering a coup de grace.

Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.

You can't deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to “find” the creature once you've determined what square it's in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).

@node Aid Another
@section Aid Another
@anchor{#aid-another}
In melee combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with an opponent. If you're in position to make a melee attack on an opponent that is engaging a friend in melee combat, you can attempt to aid your friend as a standard action. You make an attack roll against [AC] 10. If you succeed, your friend gains either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to [AC] against that opponent's next attack (your choice), as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. Multiple characters can aid the same friend, and similar bonuses stack.

You can also use this standard action to help a friend in other ways, such as when he is affected by a spell, or to assist another character's skill check.

@node Charge
@section Charge
@anchor{#charge}
Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to twice your speed and attack during the action. Charging, however, carries tight restrictions on how you can move.

@strong{Movement During a Charge}: You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent. If you move a distance equal to your speed or less, you can also draw a weapon during a charge attack if your base attack bonus is at least +1.

You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). You must move to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. If this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can't charge. If any line from your starting space to the ending space passes through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a creature (even an ally), you can't charge. [Helpless] creatures don't stop a charge.

If you don't have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.

You can't take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.

If you are able to take only a standard action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed) and you cannot draw a weapon unless you possess the [Quick Draw] feat. You can't use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a standard action on your turn.

@strong{Attacking on a Charge}: After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll and take a --2 penalty to your [AC] until the start of your next turn.

A charging character gets a +2 bonus on combat maneuver attack rolls made to [bull rush] an opponent.

Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high enough base attack bonus or from using multiple weapons, you only get to make one attack during a charge.

@strong{Lances and Charge Attacks}: A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.

@strong{Weapons Readied against a Charge}: Spears, tridents, and other weapons with the brace feature deal double damage when readied (set) and used against a charging character.

@node Combat Maneuvers
@section Combat Maneuvers
@anchor{#combat-maneuvers}
During combat, you can attempt to perform a number of maneuvers that can hinder or even cripple your foe, including bull rush, disarm, grapple, overrun, sunder, and trip. Although these maneuvers have vastly different results, they all use a similar mechanic to determine success.

@strong{Combat Maneuver Bonus}: Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Bonus (or CMB) that represents its skill at performing combat maneuvers. A creature's CMB is determined using the following formula:

@strong{CMB = Base attack bonus + [Strength] modifier + special size modifier}

Creatures that are size Tiny or smaller use their [Dexterity] modifier in place of their [Strength] modifier to determine their CMB. The special size modifier for a creature's Combat Maneuver Bonus is as follows: Fine --8, Diminutive --4, Tiny --2, Small --1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMB when performing specific maneuvers.

@strong{Performing a Combat Maneuver}: When performing a combat maneuver, you must use an action appropriate to the maneuver you are attempting to perform. While many combat maneuvers can be performed as part of an attack action, full-attack action, or attack of opportunity (in place of a melee attack), others require a specific action. Unless otherwise noted, performing a combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of the maneuver. If you are hit by the target, you take the damage normally and apply that amount as a penalty to the attack roll to perform the maneuver. If your target is immobilized, [unconscious], or otherwise incapacitated, your maneuver automatically succeeds (treat as if you rolled a natural 20 on the attack roll). If your target is [stunned], you receive a +4 bonus on your attack roll to perform a combat maneuver against it.

When you attempt to perform a combat maneuver, make an attack roll and add your CMB in place of your normal attack bonus. Add any bonuses you currently have on attack rolls due to spells, feats, and other effects. These bonuses must be applicable to the weapon or attack used to perform the maneuver. The DC of this maneuver is your target's [Combat Maneuver Defense]. Combat maneuvers are attack rolls, so you must roll for concealment and take any other penalties that would normally apply to an attack roll.

@strong{Combat Maneuver Defense}: Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Defense (or CMD) that represents its ability to resist combat maneuvers. A creature's CMD is determined using the following formula:

@strong{CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + [Strength] modifier + [Dexterity] modifier + special size modifier}

The special size modifier for a creature's Combat Maneuver Defense is as follows: Fine --8, Diminutive --4, Tiny --2, Small --1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8. Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMD when resisting specific maneuvers. A creature can also add any circumstance, deflection, dodge, insight, luck, morale, profane, and sacred bonuses to [AC] to its CMD. Any penalties to a creature's [AC] also apply to its CMD. A [flat-footed] creature does not add its [Dexterity] bonus to its CMD.

@strong{Determine Success}: If your attack roll equals or exceeds the CMD of the target, your maneuver is a success and has the listed effect. Some maneuvers, such as bull rush, have varying levels of success depending on how much your attack roll exceeds the target's CMD. Rolling a natural 20 while attempting a combat maneuver is always a success (except when attempting to escape from bonds), while rolling a natural 1 is always a failure.

@node Bull Rush
@subsection Bull Rush
@anchor{#bull-rush}
You can make a bull rush as a standard action or as part of a charge, in place of the melee attack. You can only bull rush an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. A bull rush attempts to push an opponent straight back without doing any harm. If you do not have the [Improved Bull Rush] feat, or a similar ability, initiating a bull rush provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack is successful, your target is pushed back 5 feet. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's [CMD] you can push the target back an additional 5 feet. You can move with the target if you wish but you must have the available movement to do so. If your attack fails, your movement ends in front of the target.

An enemy being moved by a bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity because of the movement unless you possess the Greater Bull Rush feat. You cannot bull rush a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle. If there is another creature in the way of your bull rush, you must immediately make a combat maneuver check to bull rush that creature. You take a --4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If you are successful, you can continue to push the creatures a distance equal to the lesser result. For example, if a fighter bull rushes a goblin for a total of 15 feet, but there is another goblin 5 feet behind the first, he must make another combat maneuver check against the second goblin after having pushed the first 5 feet. If his check reveals that he can push the second goblin a total of 20 feet, he can continue to push both goblins another 10 feet (since the first goblin will have moved a total of 15 feet).

@node Disarm
@subsection Disarm
@anchor{#disarm}
You can attempt to disarm your opponent in place of a melee attack. If you do not have the [Improved Disarm] feat, or a similar ability, attempting to disarm a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. Attempting to disarm a foe while unarmed imposes a --4 penalty on the attack.

If your attack is successful, your target drops one item it is carrying of your choice (even if the item is wielded with two hands). If your attack exceeds the [CMD] of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). If your attack fails by 10 or more, you drop the weapon that you were using to attempt the disarm. If you successfully disarm your opponent without using a weapon, you may automatically pick up the item dropped.

@node Grapple
@subsection Grapple
@anchor{#grapple}
As a standard action, you can attempt to grapple a foe, hindering his combat options. If you do not have [Improved Grapple], grab, or a similar ability, attempting to grapple a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. Humanoid creatures without two free hands attempting to grapple a foe take a --4 penalty on the combat maneuver roll. If successful, both you and the target gain the [grappled] condition (see the Appendices). If you successfully grapple a creature that is not adjacent to you, move that creature to an adjacent open space (if no space is available, your grapple fails). Although both creatures have the [grappled] condition, you can, as the creature that initiated the grapple, release the grapple as a free action, removing the condition from both you and the target. If you do not release the grapple, you must continue to make a check each round, as a standard action, to maintain the hold. If your target does not break the grapple, you get a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against the same target in subsequent rounds. Once you are grappling an opponent, a successful check allows you to continue grappling the foe, and also allows you to perform one of the following actions (as part of the standard action spent to maintain the grapple).

@emph{Move}: You can move both yourself and your target up to half your speed. At the end of your movement, you can place your target in any square adjacent to you. If you attempt to place your foe in a hazardous location, such as in a @emph{wall of fire} or over a pit, the target receives a free attempt to break your grapple with a +4 bonus.

@emph{Damage}: You can inflict damage to your target equal to your unarmed strike, a natural attack, or an attack made with armor spikes or a light or one-handed weapon. This damage can be either lethal or nonlethal.

@emph{Pin}: You can give your opponent the [pinned] condition (see @ref{#conditions,Conditions}). Despite pinning your opponent, you still only have the [grappled] condition, but you lose your [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

@emph{Tie Up}: If you have your target [pinned], otherwise restrained, or [unconscious], you can use rope to tie him up. This works like a pin effect, but the DC to escape the bonds is equal to 20 + your Combat Maneuver Bonus (instead of your [CMD]). The ropes do not need to make a check every round to maintain the pin. If you are grappling the target, you can attempt to tie him up in ropes, but doing so requires a combat maneuver check at a --10 penalty. If the DC to escape from these bindings is higher than 20 + the target's CMB, the target cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.

@strong{If You Are Grappled}: If you are [grappled], you can attempt to break the grapple as a standard action by making a combat maneuver check ; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or Escape Artist check (with a DC equal to your opponent's [CMD]). If you succeed, you break the grapple and can act normally. Alternatively, if you succeed, you can become the grappler, grappling the other creature (meaning that the other creature cannot freely release the grapple without making a combat maneuver check, while you can). Instead of attempting to break or reverse the grapple, you can take any action that doesn't require two hands to perform, such as cast a spell or make an attack or full attack with a light or one-handed weapon against any creature within your reach, including the creature that is grappling you. See the [grappled] condition for additional details. If you are [pinned], your actions are very limited. See the [pinned] condition in @ref{#conditions,Conditions} for additional details.

@strong{Multiple Creatures}: Multiple creatures can attempt to grapple one target. The creature that first initiates the grapple is the only one that makes a check, with a +2 bonus for each creature that assists in the grapple (using the Aid Another action). Multiple creatures can also assist another creature in breaking free from a grapple, with each creature that assists (using the Aid Another action) granting a +2 bonus on the [grappled] creature's combat maneuver check.

@anchor{#overrun}
As a standard action, taken during your move or as part of a charge, you can attempt to overrun your target, moving through its square. You can only overrun an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. If you do not have the [Improved Overrun] feat, or a similar ability, initiating an overrun provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. If your overrun attempt fails, you stop in the space directly in front of the opponent, or the nearest open space in front of the creature if there are other creatures occupying that space.

When you attempt to overrun a target, it can choose to avoid you, allowing you to pass through its square without requiring an attack. If your target does not avoid you, make a combat maneuver check as normal. If your maneuver is successful, you move through the target's space. If your attack exceeds your opponent's [CMD] by 5 or more, you move through the target's space and the target is knocked [prone]. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the DC of the combat maneuver attack roll for each additional leg it has.

@node Sunder
@subsection Sunder
@anchor{#sunder}
You can attempt to sunder an item held or worn by your opponent as part of an attack action in place of a melee attack. If you do not have the [Improved Sunder] feat, or a similar ability, attempting to sunder an item provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack is successful, you deal damage to the item normally. Damage that exceeds the object's Hardness is subtracted from its hit points. If an object has equal to or less than half its total hit points remaining, it gains the broken condition ). If the damage you deal would reduce the object to less than 0 hit points, you can choose to destroy it. If you do not choose to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 hit point and the broken condition.

@node Trip
@subsection Trip
@anchor{#trip}
You can attempt to trip your opponent in place of a melee attack. You can only trip an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. If you do not have the Improved Trip feat, or a similar ability, initiating a trip provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.

If your attack exceeds the target's [CMD], the target is knocked [prone]. If your attack fails by 10 or more, you are knocked [prone] instead. If the target has more than two legs, add +2 to the DC of the combat maneuver attack roll for each additional leg it has. Some creatures---such as oozes, creatures without legs, and flying creatures---cannot be tripped.

@node Feint
@section Feint
@anchor{#feint}
Feinting is a standard action. To feint, make a Bluff skill check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent's base attack bonus + your opponent's [Wisdom] modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent's Sense Motive bonus, if higher. If successful, the next melee attack you make against the target does not allow him to use his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.

When feinting against a nonhumanoid you take a --4 penalty. Against a creature of animal [Intelligence] (1 or 2), you take a --8 penalty. Against a creature lacking an [Intelligence] score, it's impossible. Feinting in combat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Feinting as a Move Action}: With the Improved Feint feat, you can attempt a feint as a move action.

@node Mounted Combat
@section Mounted Combat
@anchor{#mounted-combat}
These rules cover being mounted on a horse in combat but can also be applied to more unusual steeds, such as a griffon or dragon.

@strong{Mounts in Combat}: Horses, ponies, and riding dogs can serve readily as combat steeds. Mounts that do not possess combat training (see the Handle Animal skill) are frightened by combat. If you don't dismount, you must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control such a mount. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full-round action, and you can't do anything else until your next turn.

Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move.

A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount's space during combat.

@strong{Combat while Mounted}: With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.

When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can't make a full attack. Even at your mount's full speed, you don't take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.

If your mount charges, you also take the [AC] penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).

You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a --4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed) at a --8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally.

@strong{Casting Spells While Mounted}: You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you're casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).

@strong{If Your Mount Falls in Battle}: If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.

@strong{If You Are Dropped}: If you are knocked [unconscious], you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you're in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage. Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.

@node Throw Splash Weapon
@section Throw Splash Weapon
@anchor{#throw-splash-weapon}
A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects. To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown splash weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don't take the --4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target, and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. If the target is Large or larger, you choose one of its squares and the splash damage affects creatures within 5 feet of that square. Splash weapons cannot deal precision-based damage (such as sneak attack).

You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against [AC] 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. You can't target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you're aiming at the creature.

If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw. After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in that square and in all adjacent squares.

@node Two-Weapon Fighting
@section Two-Weapon Fighting
@anchor{#two-weapon-fighting}
If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. You suffer a --6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a --10 penalty to the attack with your off hand when you fight this way. You can reduce these penalties in two ways. First, if your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light. Second, the @ref{#two-weapon-fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting} feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.

Table: Two-weapon Fighting Penalties summarizes the interaction of all these factors.

@strong{Double Weapons}: You can use a double weapon to make an extra attack with the off-hand end of the weapon as if you were fighting with two weapons. The penalties apply as if the off-hand end of the weapon was a light weapon.

@strong{Thrown Weapons}: The same rules apply when you throw a weapon from each hand. Treat a dart or shuriken as a light weapon when used in this manner, and treat a bolas, javelin, net, or sling as a one-handed weapon.

@node Special Initiative Actions
@chapter Special Initiative Actions
@anchor{#special-initiative-actions}
Here are ways to change when you act during combat by altering your place in the initiative order.
@menu
* Delay::
* Ready::
@end menu

@node Delay
@section Delay
@anchor{#delay}
By choosing to delay, you take no action and then act normally on whatever initiative count you decide to act. When you delay, you voluntarily reduce your own initiative result for the rest of the combat. When your new, lower initiative count comes up later in the same round, you can act normally. You can specify this new initiative result or just wait until some time later in the round and act then, thus fixing your new initiative count at that point.

You never get back the time you spend waiting to see what's going to happen. You also can't interrupt anyone else's action (as you can with a readied action).

@strong{Initiative Consequences of Delaying}: Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the delayed action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed an action, you don't get to take a delayed action (though you can delay again).

If you take a delayed action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.

@node Ready
@section Ready
@anchor{#ready}
The ready action lets you prepare to take an action later, after your turn is over but before your next one has begun. Readying is a standard action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though the action that you ready might do so).

@strong{Readying an Action}: You can ready a standard action, a move action, a swift action, or a free action. To do so, specify the action you will take and the conditions under which you will take it. Then, anytime before your next action, you may take the readied action in response to that condition. The action occurs just before the action that triggers it. If the triggered action is part of another character's activities, you interrupt the other character. Assuming he is still capable of doing so, he continues his actions once you complete your readied action. Your initiative result changes. For the rest of the encounter, your initiative result is the count on which you took the readied action, and you act immediately ahead of the character whose action triggered your readied action.

You can take a 5-foot step as part of your readied action, but only if you don't otherwise move any distance during the round.

@strong{Initiative Consequences of Readying}: Your initiative result becomes the count on which you took the readied action. If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don't get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.

@strong{Distracting Spellcasters}: You can ready an attack against a spellcaster with the trigger “if she starts casting a spell.” If you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to cast (as determined by her Spellcraft check result).

@strong{Readying to Counterspell}: You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger “if she starts casting a spell”). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (and are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster's spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.

A spellcaster can use @emph{dispel magic}to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn't always work.

@strong{Readying a Weapon against a Charge}: You can ready weapons with the brace feature, setting them to receive charges. A readied weapon of this type deals double damage if you score a hit with it against a charging character.

@strong{Legend Lore}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} see text

@strong{Components} V, S, M (incense worth 250 gp), F (four pieces of ivory worth 50 gp each)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} see text

@emph{[Legend lore]}brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 × 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better @emph{legend lore}result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better @emph{legend lore}result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

Lesser (Spell Name)

@strong{Lesser (Spell Name)}

Any spell whose name begins with @emph{lesser}is alphabetized according to the spell name. Thus, the description of a @emph{lesser}spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have @emph{lesser}spells in them include those based on the spells @emph{[confusion], [geas], [globe of invulnerability], [planar ally], [planar binding],}and @emph{[restoration].}

Levitate

@strong{Levitate}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a leather loop or golden wire bent into a cup shape)

@strong{Range} personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} you or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lbs./level)

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Levitate}allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated@emph{,}and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a --1 penalty on attack rolls, the second --2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of --5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at --1.

Light

@strong{Light}

@strong{School}evocation [light]; @strong{Level}bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, M/DF (a firefly)

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}object touched

@strong{Duration}10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You can only have one @emph{light} spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent * or a similar effect), it does not count against this limit. @emph{Light}can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.

Lightning Bolt

@strong{Lightning Bolt}

@strong{School} evocation [electricity]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (fur and a glass rod)

@strong{Range} 120 ft.

@strong{Area} 120-ft. line

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.

The @emph{lightning bolt}sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

Limited Wish

@strong{Limited Wish}

@strong{School}universal; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (diamond worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range}see text

@strong{Target, Effect, Area}see text

@strong{Duration}see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A @emph{limited wish}lets you create nearly any type of effect. For example, a @emph{limited wish}can do any of the following things.

@itemize
@item
Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as or @emph{[insanity]}.
@item
Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above effects, such as a single creature automatically hitting on its next attack or taking a --7 penalty on its next saving throw.
@end itemize

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and [spell resistance] as normal, but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a @emph{limited wish}spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).

Liveoak

@strong{Liveoak}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} tree touched

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while @emph{liveoak}is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree. @emph{Liveoak}must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak. The @emph{liveoak}spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.

If @emph{liveoak}is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to return to its original location before taking root.

Locate Creature

@strong{Locate Creature}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Components}: V, S, M (fur from a bloodhound)

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

This spell functions like @emph{[locate object],}except this spell locates a known creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature is moving, if any.

The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.

Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by @emph{[mislead]}, @emph{[nondetection]}, and @emph{[polymorph]}spells.

Locate Object

@strong{Locate Object}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a forked twig)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40 ft./level

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search for general items, in which case you locate the nearest of its kind if more than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination).

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell. @emph{[Polymorph any object]}and@emph{[nondetection]}fool it.

Longstrider

@strong{Longstrider}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

This spell gives you a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your base speed. It has no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim.

Lullaby

@strong{Lullaby}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Duration} concentration + 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any creature within the area that fails a [Will] save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a --5 penalty on Perception checks and a --2 penalty on [Will] saves against @emph{[sleep]}effects while the @emph{lullaby}is in effect. @emph{Lullaby}lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter.

@strong{Wail of the Banshee}

@strong{School} necromancy [death, sonic]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature/level within a 40-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes

When you cast this spell, you emit a terrible, soul-chilling scream that possibly kills creatures that hear it (except for yourself). The spell affects up to one creature per caster level, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. Creatures closest to the point of origin are affected first.

Wall of Fire

@strong{Wall of Fire}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a piece of phosphor)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} opaque sheet of flame up to 20 ft. long/level or a ring of fire with a radius of up to 5 ft./two levels; either form 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} concentration + 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.

If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.)

@emph{Wall of fire}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent @emph{wall of fire}that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.

Wall of Force

@strong{Wall of Force}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered quartz)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect}wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level

@strong{Duration} 1 round /level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A @emph{wall of force} creates an invisible wall of pure force. The wall cannot move and is not easily destroyed. A @emph{wall of force} is immune to @emph{[dispel magic],}although a @emph{[mage's disjunction]} can still dispel it@emph{.}A@emph{wall of force}can be damaged by spells as normal, except for@emph{[disintegrate],} which automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but a @emph{wall of force} has hardness 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a @emph{[sphere of annihilation]}or @emph{[rod of cancellation]} instantly destroys a @emph{wall of force.}

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a @emph{wall of force} in either direction, although @emph{[dimension door]}, @emph{[teleport]}, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent the wall by going around it, through material floors and ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a @emph{wall of force}.

The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by any object or creature, the spell fails.

@emph{Wall of force}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Wall of Ice

@strong{Wall of Ice}

@strong{School} evocation [cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a piece of quartz or rock crystal)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A @emph{wall of ice}cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a [Reflex] save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a @emph{wall of ice,}and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a @emph{wall of ice}creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.

@emph{Ice Plane}: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a @emph{wall of ice} 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.

Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.

Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).

@emph{Hemisphere}: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The @emph{hemisphere}is as hard to break through as the @emph{ice plane}form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

Wall of Iron

@strong{Wall of Iron}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a small iron sheet plus gold dust worth 50 gp)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} iron wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level; see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.

A @emph{wall of iron}is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the [Strength] check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness.

If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40 [Strength] check to push the wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful [Reflex] saves. Any Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be sold.

Wall of Stone

@strong{Wall of Stone}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [earth]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a small block of granite)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level (S)

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock surfaces. A @emph{wall of stone}is 1 inch thick per four caster levels and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.

Unlike a @emph{[wall of iron],}you can create a @emph{wall of stone}in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a @emph{[disintegrate]}spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the [Strength] check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a @emph{wall of stone}, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful [Reflex] saves.

Wall of Thorns

@strong{Wall of Thorns}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}wall of thorny brush, up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A @emph{wall of thorns}spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable, tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a @emph{wall of thorns}takes piercing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's [AC]. [Dexterity] and [dodge bonus]es to [AC] do not count for this calculation. of 25 or higher, without considering [Dexterity] and [dodge bonus]es, take no damage from contact with the wall.)

You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.

Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a [Strength] check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.

Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a @emph{wall of thorns}at normal speed without taking damage.

A @emph{wall of thorns}can be breached by slow work with edged weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.

Warp Wood

@strong{Warp Wood}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a [Strength] check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a --4 penalty on attack rolls.

You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. @emph{[Make whole]}, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive @emph{warp wood}spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.

Water Breathing

@strong{Water Breathing}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (short reed or piece of straw)

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Water Walk

@strong{Targets} one touched creature/level

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover an inch or two above the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it. The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.

If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.

Waves of Exhaustion

@strong{Waves of Exhaustion}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} no; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Waves of negative energy cause all living creatures in the spell's area to become [exhausted]. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [exhausted].

Waves of Fatigue

@strong{Waves of Fatigue}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 30 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped burst

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} no; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Waves of negative energy render all living creatures in the spell's area [fatigued]. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [fatigued].

Web

@strong{Web}

@strong{School}conjuration (creation); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (spider web)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration}10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Reflex] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}no

@emph{Web}creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become [grappled] by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause you to become [grappled].

Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a [Reflex] save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the [grappled] condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become [grappled] in the first square of webbing that they enter.

If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.

The strands of a @emph{web}spell are flammable. A @emph{flaming weapon}can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

@emph{Web}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell. A permanent web that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

Weird

@strong{Weird}

@strong{School} illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Targets} any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[phantasmal killer]}, except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.

If a subject's [Fortitude] save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is [stunned] for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of [Strength] damage.

Whirlwind

@strong{Whirlwind}

@strong{School} evocation [air]; @strong{Level} druid 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} cyclone 10 ft. wide at base, 30 ft. wide at top, and 30 ft. tall

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Reflex] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.)

Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a [Reflex] save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

Whispering Wind

@strong{Whispering Wind}

@strong{School} transmutation [air]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 1 mile/level

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} no more than 1 hour/level or until discharged (destination is reached)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The @emph{whispering wind}travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A @emph{whispering wind}is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the @emph{whispering wind}seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the @emph{whispering wind}to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with @emph{magic mouth, whispering wind}cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

Wind Walk

@strong{Wind Walk}

@strong{School} transmutation [air]; @strong{Level} cleric 6, druid 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} you and one touched creature per three levels

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D); see text

@strong{Saving Throw} no and [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no and yes (harmless)

You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the @emph{[gaseous form]}spell) and move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.

Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not [invisible] but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.

A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.

For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

Wind Wall

@strong{Wind Wall}

@strong{School} evocation [air]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, druid 3, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect}wall up to 10 ft./level long and 5 ft./level high (S)

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A [Reflex] save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a @emph{wind wall.}Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in [gaseous form] cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to [incorporeal] creatures).

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square @emph{wind walls} to enclose specific points.

@strong{Saving Throw} none, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Wish}is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even @emph{wish}, however, has its limits. A @emph{wish}can produce any one of the following effects.

@itemize
@item
Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 8th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
@item
Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as @emph{[geas/quest]}or @emph{[insanity]}.
@item
Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five @emph{wish} spells cast in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two @emph{wishes} for a +2 inherent bonus, three @emph{wishes} for a +3 inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. @emph{Note}: An inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.
@item
Remove injuries and afflictions. A single @emph{wish}can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both with the same @emph{wish}.
@item
Revive the dead. A @emph{wish}can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a @emph{[resurrection]}spell. A @emph{wish}can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two @emph{wishes}: one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A @emph{wish}cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life from gaining a permanent negative level.
@item
Transport travelers. A @emph{wish}can lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a [Will] save to negate the effect, and [spell resistance] (if any) applies.
@item
Undo misfortune. A @emph{wish}can undo a single recent event. The @emph{wish}forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a @emph{wish}could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a [Will] save to negate the effect, and [spell resistance] (if any) applies.
@end itemize

You may try to use a @emph{wish}to produce greater effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The @emph{wish}may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.)

Duplicated spells allow saves and [spell resistance] as normal (but save DCs are for 9th-level spells).

When a @emph{wish}duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).

W@emph{ood shape}enables you to form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any nonchaotic creature within the area of a @emph{word of chaos}spell suffers the following ill effects, depending on their HD.

@multitable {Up to caster level --10} {Killed, [confused], [stunned], [deafened]} 
@headitem

@item 
Up to caster level --5
 @tab [Confused], [stunned], [deafened]
@item 
Up to caster level --10
 @tab Killed, [confused], [stunned], [deafened]
@end multitable

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

@emph{Deafened}: The creature is [deafened] for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.

@emph{Stunned}: The creature is [stunned] for 1 round. Save negates.

@emph{Confused}: The creature is [confused] for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Save reduces the [confused] effect to 1 round.

@emph{Killed}: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the @emph{word of chaos}or not@emph{.}The banishment effect allows a [Will] save (at a --4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by @emph{word of chaos.}

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no or yes (harmless, object)

@emph{Word of recall}teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

An unwilling creature can't be teleported by @emph{word of recall.}Likewise, a creature's [Will] save ) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a @emph{mage armor}spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to [AC].

Unlike mundane armor, @emph{mage armor}entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since @emph{mage armor}is made of force, [incorporeal] creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

@strong{Area}all magical effects and magic items within a 40-ft.-radius burst, or one magic item (see text)

@strong{Duration}1 minute/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a @emph{[dispel magic]}spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful [Will] save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature's possession uses its own [Will] save bonus or its possessor's [Will] save bonus, whichever is higher. If an item's saving throw results in a natural 1 on the die, the item is destroyed instead of being suppressed.

You also have a 1% chance per caster level of destroying an @emph{[antimagic field].}If the @emph{[antimagic field]}survives the @emph{disjunction,}no items within it are disjoined.

You can also use this spell to target a single item. The item gets a [Will] save at a --5 penalty to avoid being permanently destroyed. Even artifacts are subject to @emph{mage's disjunction,}though there is only a 1% chance per caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful, the artifact's power unravels, and it is destroyed (with no save). If an artifact is destroyed, you must make a DC 25 [Will] save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even @emph{[miracle]}or @emph{[wish]}. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful being who has an interest in or connection with the device.

Mage's Faithful Hound

@strong{Mage's Faithful Hound}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} phantom watchdog

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/caster level or until discharged, then 1 round/caster level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is [invisible] to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured (it does not move). The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees [invisible] and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions.

If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round. The dog also gets the bonuses appropriate to an [invisible] creature (see @emph{[invisibility]}).

The dog is considered ready to bite intruders, so it delivers its first bite on the intruder's turn. Its bite is the equivalent of a magic weapon for the purpose of [damage reduction]. The hound cannot be attacked, but it can be dispelled.

The spell lasts for 1 hour per caster level, but once the hound begins barking, it lasts only 1 round per caster level. If you are ever more than 100 feet distant from the hound, the spell ends.

Mage's Lucubration

@strong{Mage's Lucubration}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level}wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

You instantly prepare any one spell of 5th level or lower that you have used during the past 24 hours. The spell must have been actually cast during that period. The chosen spell is stored in your mind as through prepared in the normal fashion.

If the recalled spell requires material components, you must provide them. The recovered spell is not usable until the material components are available.

Mage's Magnificent Mansion

@strong{Mage's Magnificent Mansion}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a miniature ivory door, a piece of polished marble, and a silver spoon, each worth 5 gp)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} extradimensional mansion, up to three 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You conjure up an extradimensional dwelling that has a single entrance on the plane from which the spell was cast. The entry point looks like a faint shimmering in the air that is 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. Only those you designate may enter the mansion, and the portal is shut and made [invisible] behind you when you enter. You may open it again from your own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you desire to the limit of the spell's effect. The place is furnished and contains sufficient foodstuffs to serve a nine-course banquet to a dozen people per caster level. A staff of near-transparent servants (as many as two per caster level), liveried and obedient, wait upon all who enter. The servants function as @emph{unseen servant}spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the mansion.

Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the mansion, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.

Mage's Private Sanctum

@strong{Mage's Private Sanctum}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a sheet of lead, a piece of glass, a wad of cotton, and powdered chrysolite)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 30-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} 24 hours (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. @ref{#darkvision,Darkvision} cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells cannot perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to @emph{[detect thoughts]}. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), but it does not prevent other communication, such as a @emph{[sending]}or @emph{message}spell, or telepathic communication, such as that between a wizard and her familiar.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.

@emph{Mage's private sanctum}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Mage's Sword

@strong{Mage's Sword}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a miniature platinum sword worth 250 gp)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one sword

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell brings into being a shimmering, sword-like plane of force. The sword strikes at any opponent within its range, as you desire, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks its designated target once each round on your turn. Its attack bonus is equal to your caster level + your Intelligence bonus or your [Charisma] bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively) with an additional +3 enhancement bonus. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and [incorporeal] creatures. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage, with a threat range of 19--20 and a critical multiplier of ×2.

The sword always strikes from your direction. It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.

The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but @emph{[dispel magic]}, @emph{[disintegrate]}, a @emph{[sphere of annihilation]}, or a @emph{[rod of cancellation]}affects it. The sword's [AC] is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).

If an attacked creature has [spell resistance], the resistance is checked the first time @emph{mage's sword}strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

Magic Aura

@strong{Magic Aura}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched object weighing up to 5 lbs./level

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You alter an item's aura so that it registers to @emph{detect}spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were nonmagical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing @emph{magic aura}has @emph{identify}cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a [Will] save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), @emph{magic aura}doesn't work.

@emph{Note}: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.

Magic Circle against Chaos

@strong{Magic Circle against Chaos}

@strong{School} abjuration [lawful]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

This spell functions like @emph{[magic circle against evil],}except that it is similar to @emph{[protection from chaos]}instead of @emph{[protection from evil]}, and it can imprison a nonlawful called creature.

Magic Circle against Evil

@strong{Magic Circle against Evil}

@strong{School} abjuration [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no; see text

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a @emph{[protection from evil]}spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's [spell resistance] in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of @emph{[protection from evil]}), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' [spell resistance].

This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A @emph{magic circle against evil}can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the @emph{[lesser planar binding], [planar binding],}and @emph{[greater planar binding]}spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the @emph{magic circle}. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal @emph{[protection from evil]}spell for that creature only.

A @emph{magic circle}leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has [spell resistance], it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its [spell resistance], the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (@emph{[astral projection], blink, [dimension door], [etherealness], [gate], [plane shift], [shadow walk], [teleport],}and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a @emph{[dimensional anchor]}spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the @emph{anchor}effect lasts as long as the @emph{magic circle}does. The creature cannot reach across the @emph{magic circle,}but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.

You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the @emph{magic circle}more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.

A successful diagram allows you to cast a @emph{[dimensional anchor]}spell on the @emph{magic circle}during the round before casting any summoning spell. The @emph{anchor}holds any called creatures in the @emph{magic circle}for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its [spell resistance] against a @emph{magic circle}prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a [Charisma] check to break free of the trap (see the @emph{[lesser planar binding]}spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram---even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

This spell is not cumulative with @emph{[protection from evil]}and vice versa.

Magic Circle against Good

@strong{Magic Circle against Good}

@strong{School} abjuration [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

This spell functions like @emph{[magic circle against evil],}except that it is similar to @emph{[protection from good]}instead of @emph{[protection from evil]}, and it can imprison a nonevil called creature.

Magic Circle against Law

@strong{Magic Circle against Law}

@strong{School} abjuration [chaotic]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

This spell functions like @emph{[magic circle against evil],}except that it is similar to @emph{[protection from law]}instead of @emph{[protection from evil]}, and it can imprison a nonchaotic called creature.

Magic Fang

@strong{Magic Fang}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Magic fang}gives one natural weapon or unarmed strike of the subject a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The spell can affect a slam attack, fist, bite, or other natural weapon. The spell does not change an unarmed strike's damage from nonlethal damage to lethal damage.

@emph{Magic fang}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Magic Fang, Greater}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 3, ranger 3

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

This spell functions like @emph{[magic fang]}, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass [damage reduction] aside from magic.

Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).

@emph{Greater magic fang}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Magic Jar

@strong{Magic Jar}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp)

@strong{Range} medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until you return to your body

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

By casting @emph{magic jar,}you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the @emph{magic jar}), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the @emph{magic jar.}You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the @emph{magic jar}must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.

While in the @emph{magic jar,}you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)

You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.

Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by @emph{[protection from evil]}or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the @emph{magic jar}unless the subject succeeds on a [Will] save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the @emph{magic jar,}and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.

If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the @emph{magic jar.}You keep your [Intelligence], [Wisdom], [Charisma], level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its [Strength], [Dexterity], [Constitution], hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.

As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the @emph{magic jar}if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.

If the host body is slain, you return to the @emph{magic jar,}if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.

If the spell ends while you are in the @emph{magic jar,}you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the @emph{magic jar}returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the @emph{magic jar}or the host's location.

Magic Missile

@strong{Magic Missile}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile---two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for [spell resistance] or roll damage.

Magic Mouth

@strong{Magic Mouth}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust worth 10 gp)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature or object

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. @emph{Magic mouth}can also be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.

The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical @emph{[darkness]}or @emph{[invisibility]}does. Silent movement or magical @emph{[silence]}defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A @emph{magic mouth}cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.

The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a @emph{magic mouth}to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

@emph{Magic mouth}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Magic Stone

@strong{Magic Stone}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 1, druid 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} up to three pebbles touched

@strong{Duration} 30 minutes or until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The spell gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack@emph{.}Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the spell's enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.

Magic Vestment

@strong{Magic Vestment}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} armor or shield touched

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no [AC] bonus for the purpose of this spell.

Magic Weapon

@strong{Magic Weapon}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}weapon touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

@emph{Magic weapon}gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike *). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.

@strong{Magic Weapon, Greater}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

This spell functions like @emph{[magic weapon],}except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass [damage reduction] aside from magic.

Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Major Creation

@strong{Major Creation}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time}: 10 minutes

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Duration} see text

This spell functions like @emph{[minor creation],}except that you can also create an object of mineral nature: stone, crystal, metal, or the like. The duration of the created item varies with its relative hardness and rarity, as indicated on the following table.

Hardness and Rarity Examples

Duration

Vegetable matter

2 hr./level

Stone, crystal, base metals

1 hr./level

Precious metals

20 min./level

Gems

10 min./level

Rare metal*

1 round/level

* Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, and mithral. You can't use major creation to create a cold iron item.

Major Image

@strong{Major Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Duration} Concentration + 3 rounds

This spell functions like @emph{[silent image],}except that sound, smell, and thermal illusions are included in the spell effect. While concentrating, you can move the image within the range.

The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately.

Make Whole

@strong{Make Whole}

@strong{School}transmutation; @strong{Level}cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one object of up to 10 cu. ft./level or one construct creature of any size

This spell functions as @emph{mending}, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on a construct creature (maximum 5d6).

@emph{Make whole} can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When @emph{make whole} is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow [spell resistance].

Mark of Justice

@strong{Mark of Justice}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 5, paladin 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} permanent; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You mark a subject and state some behavior on the part of the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. Typically, you designate some sort of undesirable behavior that activates the mark, but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the effect of @emph{[bestow curse]}.

Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.

Like the effect of @emph{[bestow curse]}, a @emph{mark of justice}cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a @emph{[break enchantment]}, @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[miracle]}, @emph{[remove curse]}, or @emph{[wish]}spell. @emph{[Remove curse]}works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your @emph{mark of justice}caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark has activated.

Mass (Spell Name)

@strong{Mass (Spell Name)}

Any spell whose name begins with @emph{mass}is alphabetized according to the spell name. Thus, the description of a @emph{mass}spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains that have @emph{mass}spells in them include those based on the spells @emph{[bear's endurance], [bull's strength], [cat's grace], [charm monster], [cure critical wounds], [cure light wounds], [cure moderate wounds], [cure serious wounds], [eagle's splendor], [enlarge person], [fox's cunning], [heal], [hold monster], [hold person], [inflict critical wounds], [inflict light wounds], [inflict moderate wounds], [inflict serious wounds], [invisibility], [owl's wisdom], [reduce person],}and @emph{[suggestion].}

Maze

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 [Intelligence] check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the @emph{maze}spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as @emph{[teleport]}and @emph{[dimension door],}do not help a creature escape a @emph{maze}spell, although a @emph{[plane shift]}spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

Meld into Stone

@strong{Meld into Stone}

@strong{School} transmutation [earth]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, druid 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@emph{Meld into stone}enables you to meld your body and possessions into a single block of stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate your body in all three dimensions. When the casting is complete, you and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.

While in the stone, you remain in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the stone through which you melded. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while hiding in the stone. Nothing that goes on outside the stone can be seen, but you can still hear what happens around you. Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 [Fortitude] save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.

Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.

The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying. @emph{[Stone to flesh]}expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. S@emph{[tone shape]}deals 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. @emph{[Transmute rock to mud]}expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 [Fortitude] save, in which case you are merely expelled. Finally, @emph{[passwall]}expels you without damage.

@strong{Target} one object of up to 1 lb./level

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: yes (harmless, object)

This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If the object has the [broken] condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items.

Message

@strong{Message}

@strong{School} transmutation [language-dependent]; @strong{Level} bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a piece of copper wire)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical @emph{[silence],}1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.

Meteor Swarm

@strong{Meteor Swarm}

@strong{School}evocation [fire]; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area}four 40-ft.-radius spreads, see text

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Reflex] half, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Meteor swarm}is a very powerful and spectacular spell that is similar to @emph{[fireball]}in many aspects. When you cast it, four 2-foot-diameter spheres spring from your outstretched hand and streak in straight lines to the spots you select. The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.

If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a --4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.

Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area. If a creature is within the area of more than one sphere, it must save separately against each. Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.

Mind Blank

@strong{Mind Blank}

@strong{School}abjuration; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target}one creature

@strong{Duration}24 hours

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as @emph{[detect evil], [locate creature], scry,}and@emph{see invisible}). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. @emph{Mind blank}even foils @emph{[limited wish]}, @emph{[miracle]}, and @emph{[wish]}spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as @emph{[arcane eye],}the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.

Mind Fog

@strong{Mind Fog}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 30 minutes and 2d6 rounds; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Mind fog}produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the @emph{mind fog}take a --10 penalty on [Wisdom] checks and [Will] saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

Minor Creation

@strong{Minor Creation}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create with @emph{minor creation)}

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving plant matter, up to 1 cu. ft./level

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate Craft skill check to make a complex item.

Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.

Minor Image

@strong{Minor Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

This spell functions like @emph{[silent image]}, except that @emph{minor image}includes some minor sounds but not understandable speech.

Miracle

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target, Effect, or Area}see text

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You don't so much cast a @emph{miracle}as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the power you pray to for spells) intercede.

A @emph{miracle}can do any of the following things.

@itemize
@item
Duplicate any cleric spell of 8th level or lower.
@item
Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower.
@item
Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as @emph{[feeblemind]}or @emph{[insanity]}.
@item
Have any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.
@end itemize

Alternatively, a cleric can make a very powerful request. Casting such a @emph{miracle}costs the cleric 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the powerful divine energies involved. Examples of especially powerful @emph{miracles}of this sort could include the following:

@itemize
@item
Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting.
@item
Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error.
@item
Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster.
@end itemize

In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and [spell resistance] as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a @emph{miracle}spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.

Mirage Arcana

@strong{Mirage Arcana}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Area} one 20-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} concentration +1 hour/ level (D)

This spell functions like @emph{[hallucinatory terrain]}, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike @emph{[hallucinatory terrain],}the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).

Mirror Image

@strong{Mirror Image}

@strong{School}illusion (figment); @strong{Level}bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min./level

This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you.

When @emph{mirror image}is cast, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.

An attacker must be able to see the figments to be fooled. If you are [invisible] or the attacker is blind, the spell has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).

Misdirection

@strong{Misdirection}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (@emph{[detect evil], [detect magic], [discern lies],}and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of @emph{misdirection}is detected as if it were the other object. Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect. Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a [Will] save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic , [detect thoughts], [clairaudience/clairvoyance],*and the like).

Mislead

@strong{Mislead}

@strong{School} illusion (figment, glamer); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target/Effect} you/one illusory double

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] disbelief (if interacted with); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You become [invisible] (as @emph{greater invisibility}, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you ,*a figment) appears. You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning [invisible]. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out the same activity until the duration expires. The @emph{greater invisibility}lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

Mnemonic Enhancer

@strong{Mnemonic Enhancer}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level}wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a piece of string, and ink consisting of squid secretion mixed with black dragon's blood), F (an ivory plaque worth 50 gp)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

Casting this spell allows you to prepare additional spells or retain spells recently cast. Pick one of these two versions when the spell is cast.

@emph{Prepare}: You prepare up to three additional levels of spells. A cantrip counts as 1/2 level for this purpose. You prepare and cast these spells normally.

@emph{Retain}: You retain any spell of 3rd level or lower that you had cast up to 1 round before you started casting the @emph{mnemonic enhancer}. This restores the previously cast spell to your mind.

In either event, the spell or spells prepared or retained fade after 24 hours (if not cast).

Modify Memory

@strong{Modify Memory}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round; see text

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways.

@itemize
@item
Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced. This spell cannot negate @emph{charm, [geas/quest], [suggestion],}or similar spells.
@item
Allow the subject to recall with perfect clarity an event it actually experienced.
@item
Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.
@item
Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.
@end itemize

Casting the spell takes 1 round. If the subject fails to save, you proceed with the spell by spending as much as 5 minutes (a period of time equal to the amount of memory you want to modify) visualizing the memory you wish to modify in the subject. If your concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, or if the subject is ever beyond the spell's range during this time, the spell is lost.

A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the creature's natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory is dismissed by the creature as a bad dream, too much wine, or another similar excuse.

Moment of Prescience

@strong{Moment of Prescience}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until discharged

This spell grants you a sixth sense. Once during the spell's duration, you may choose to use its effect. This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your [AC] against a single attack (even if [flat-footed]). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the @emph{moment of prescience}before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one @emph{moment of prescience}active on you at the same time.

Mount

@strong{Mount}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a bit of horse hair)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one mount

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You summon a light horse or a pony (your choice) to serve you as a mount. The steed serves willingly and well. The mount comes with a bit and bridle and a riding saddle.

Move Earth

@strong{Move Earth}

@strong{School} transmutation [earth]; @strong{Level} druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} see text

@strong{Components} V, S, M (clay, loam, sand, and an iron blade)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} dirt in an area up to 750 ft. square and up to 10 ft. deep (S)

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Move earth}moves dirt (clay, loam, sand, and soil), possibly collapsing embankments, moving hillocks, shifting dunes, and so forth.

In no event can rock formations be collapsed or moved. The area to be affected determines the casting time. For every 150-foot square (up to 10 feet deep), casting takes 10 minutes. The maximum area, 750 feet by 750 feet, takes 4 hours and 10 minutes to move.

This spell does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacial fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.

The spell cannot be used for tunneling and is generally too slow to trap or bury creatures. Its primary use is for digging or filling moats or for adjusting terrain contours before a battle.

This spell has no effect on earth creatures.

A spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and experienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.

Most spellcasters prepare spells in advance---whether from a spellbook or through prayers---while some cast spells spontaneously without preparation. Despite these different ways characters use to learn or prepare their spells, when it comes to casting them, the spells are very much alike.

@node Casting Spells

@node Choosing a Spell
@section Choosing a Spell
@anchor{#choosing-a-spell}
First you must choose which spell to cast. If you're a cleric, druid, experienced paladin, experienced ranger, or wizard, you select from among spells prepared earlier in the day and not yet cast (see Preparing Wizard Spells and Preparing Divine Spells).

If you're a bard or sorcerer, you can select any spell you know, provided you are capable of casting spells of that level or higher.

To cast a spell, you must be able to speak (if the spell has a verbal component), gesture (if it has a somatic component), and manipulate the material components or focus (if any). Additionally, you must concentrate to cast a spell.

If a spell has multiple versions, you choose which version to use when you cast it. You don't have to prepare (or learn, in the case of a bard or sorcerer) a specific version of the spell.

Once you've cast a prepared spell, you can't cast it again until you prepare it again. (If you've prepared multiple copies of a single spell, you can cast each copy once.) If you're a bard or sorcerer, casting a spell counts against your daily limit for spells of that spell level, but you can cast the same spell again if you haven't reached your limit.

@caption{Table: Concentration Check DCs}
@end float
To cast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts your concentration while you're casting, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell. When you make a concentration check, you roll d20 and add your caster level and the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type. Clerics, druids, and rangers add their [Wisdom] modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers add their [Charisma] modifier. Finally, wizards add their [Intelligence] modifier. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the spell you are trying to cast, the higher the DC (see Table: Concentration Check DCs). If you fail the check, you lose the spell just as if you had cast it to no effect.

@strong{Injury}: If you take damage while trying to cast a spell, you must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + the damage taken + the level of the spell you're casting. If you fail the check, you lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if it comes between the time you started and the time you complete a spell (for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in response to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).

If you are taking continuous damage, such as from an @emph{acid arrow} or by standing in a lake of lava, half the damage is considered to take place while you are casting a spell. You must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the spell you're casting. If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal, then the damage is over and does not distract you.

@strong{Spell}: If you are affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell affecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + the damage taken + the level of the spell you're casting.

If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the spell's saving throw DC + the level of the spell you're casting. For a spell with no saving throw, it's the DC that the spell's saving throw would have if a save were allowed (10 + spell level + caster's ability score).

@strong{Grappling or Pinned}: The only spells you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without somatic components and whose material components (if any) you have in hand. Even so, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + the grappler's CMB + the level of the spell you're casting) or lose the spell.

@strong{Vigorous Motion}: If you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you're casting) or lose the spell.

@strong{Violent Motion}: If you are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being pitched roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you're casting) or lose the spell. If the motion is extremely violent, such as that caused by an earthquake, the DC is equal to 20 + the level of the spell you're casting.

@strong{Violent Weather}: You must make a concentration check if you try to cast a spell in violent weather. If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the level of the spell you're casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell you're casting. In either case, you lose the spell if you fail the concentration check. If the weather is caused by a spell, use the rules as described in the spell's description.

@strong{Casting Defensively}: If you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of opportunity, you must make a concentration check (DC 15 + double the level of the spell you're casting) to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.

@strong{Entangled}: If you want to cast a spell while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you're affected by a spell with similar effects, you must make a concentration check to cast the spell (DC 15 + the level of the spell you're casting). You lose the spell if you fail.

@node Counterspells
@section Counterspells
@anchor{#counterspells}
It is possible to cast any spell as a counterspell. By doing so, you are using the spell's energy to disrupt the casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.

@strong{How Counterspells Work}: To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by choosing to [ready an action]. In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to cast a spell. You may still move at your normal speed, since ready is a standard action.

If the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level). This check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly identify the opponent's spell and can attempt to counter it. If the check fails, you can't do either of these things.

To complete the action, you must then cast an appropriate spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (or have a slot of the appropriate level available), you cast it, creating a counterspell effect. If the target is within range, both spells automatically negate each other with no other results.

@strong{Counterspelling Metamagic Spells}: [Metamagic] feats are not taken into account when determining whether a spell can be countered.

@strong{Specific Exceptions}: Some spells can counter other specific spells, often those with diametrically opposed effects.

@strong{@emph{Dispel Magic} as a Counterspell}: You can usually use @emph{dispel magic}to counterspell another spell being cast without needing to identify the spell being cast. @emph{Dispel magic}doesn't always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).

@node Caster Level
@section Caster Level
@anchor{#caster-level}
A spell's power often depends on its caster level, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to her class level in the class she's using to cast the spell.

You can cast a spell at a lower caster level than normal, but the caster level you choose must be high enough for you to cast the spell in question, and all level-dependent features must be based on the same caster level.

In the event that a class feature or other special ability provides an adjustment to your caster level, that adjustment applies not only to effects based on caster level (such as range, duration, and damage dealt), but also to your caster level check to overcome your target's spell resistance and to the caster level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).

@node Spell Failure
@section Spell Failure
@anchor{#spell-failure}
If you ever try to cast a spell in conditions where the characteristics of the spell cannot be made to conform, the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

Spells also fail if your concentration is broken and might fail if you're wearing armor while casting a spell with somatic components.

@node The Spell's Result
@section The Spell's Result
@anchor{#the-spells-result}
Once you know which creatures (or objects or areas) are affected, and whether those creatures have made successful saving throws (if any were allowed), you can apply whatever results a spell entails.

@node Special Spell Effects
@section Special Spell Effects
@anchor{#special-spell-effects}
Many special spell effects are handled according to the school of the spells in question. Certain other special spell features are found across spell schools.

@strong{Attacks}: Some spell descriptions refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don't damage opponents, are considered attacks. Attempts to channel energy count as attacks if it would harm any creatures in the area. All spells that opponents resist with saving throws, that deal damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells that summon monsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells themselves don't harm anyone.

@strong{Bonus Types}: Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don't generally stack. With the exception of [dodge bonus]es, most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus of a given type works (see Combining Magical Effects). The same principle applies to penalties---a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one, although most penalties have no type and thus always stack. Bonuses without a type always stack, unless they are from the same source.

@strong{Bringing Back the Dead}: Several spells have the power to restore slain characters to life.

When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead involves magically retrieving his soul and returning it to his body. For more information on the planes, see [Environment].

@emph{Negative Levels}: Any creature brought back to life usually gains one or more permanent negative levels (see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities}). These levels apply a penalty to most rolls until removed through spells such as @emph{restoration}. If the character was 1st level at the time of death, he loses 2 points of [Constitution] instead of gaining a negative level.

@emph{Preventing Revivification}: Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using @emph{raise dead}or @emph{resurrection}to restore the slain character to life. Casting @emph{trap the soul}prevents any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.

@emph{Revivification against One's Will}: A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.

@node Combining Magic Effects
@section Combining Magic Effects
@anchor{#combining-magic-effects}
Spells or magical effects usually work as described, no matter how many other spells or magical effects happen to be operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specific effect on other spells, the spell description explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when spells or magical effects operate in the same place:

@strong{Stacking Effects}: Spells that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don't stack even if they come from different spells (or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above).

@emph{Different Bonus Types}: The bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of different types. A bonus that doesn't have a type stacks with any bonus.

@emph{Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths}: In cases when two or more identical spells are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the one with the highest strength applies.

@emph{Same Effect with Differing Results}: The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.

@emph{One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant}: Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both spells are still active, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.

@emph{Multiple Mental Control Effects}: Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant, such as spells that remove the subject's ability to act. Mental controls that don't remove the recipient's ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed [Charisma] checks to determine which one the creature obeys.

@strong{Spells with Opposite Effects}: Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a spell's description.

@strong{Instantaneous Effects}: Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same target.

@node Abjuration
@subsection Abjuration
@anchor{#abjuration-10}
Abjurations are protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.

If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere with each other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such spells with the Perception skill drops by 4.

If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.

@node Conjuration
@subsection Conjuration
@anchor{#conjuration-10}
Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane (calling); create objects or effects on the spot (creation); heal (healing); bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or forms of energy to you (summoning); or transport creatures or objects over great distances (teleportation). Creatures you conjure usually---but not always---obey your commands.

A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it.

The creature or object must appear within the spell's range, but it does not have to remain within the range.

@strong{Calling}: A calling spell transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can't be dispelled.

@strong{Creation}: A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the spellcaster designates. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.

@strong{Healing}: Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.

@strong{Summoning}: A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower, but it is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can't be summoned again.

When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have.

@strong{Teleportation}: A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.

Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.

@node Divination
@subsection Divination
@anchor{#divination-10}
Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, predict the future, find hidden things, and foil deceptive spells.

Many divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you choose. The cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in the descriptive text for the spell.

@strong{Scrying}: A scrying spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level of acuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells or effects that emanate from you. The sensor, however, is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.

A creature can notice the sensor by making a Perception check with a DC 20 + the spell level. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.

Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense that the spell is blocked.

@node Enchantment
@subsection Enchantment
@anchor{#enchantment-10}
Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.

All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two subschools of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.

@strong{Charm}: A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.

@strong{Compulsion}: A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way its mind works. Some compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the subject, others allow you to determine the subject's actions when you cast the spell, and still others give you ongoing control over the subject.

@node Evocation
@subsection Evocation
@anchor{#evocation-10}
Evocation spells manipulate magical energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, an evocation draws upon magic to create something out of nothing. Many of these spells produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.

@node Illusion
@subsection Illusion
@anchor{#illusion-10}
Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.

@strong{Figment}: A figment spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not their own slightly different versions of the figment. It is not a personalized mental impression. Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the figment produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like (or copy another sense exactly unless you have experienced it).

Because figments and glamers are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other types of illusions can. Figments and glamers cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide protection from the elements. Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding foes, but useless for attacking them directly.

A figment's [AC] is equal to 10 + its size modifier.

@strong{Glamer}: A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.

@strong{Pattern}: Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting spells.

@strong{Phantasm}: A phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental impression, all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see. Third parties viewing or studying the scene don't notice the phantasm. All phantasms are mind-affecting spells.

@strong{Shadow}: A shadow spell creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.

@strong{Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief)}: Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.

A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.

A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an illusion isn't real needs no saving throw. If any viewer successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.

@node Necromancy
@subsection Necromancy
@anchor{#necromancy-10}
Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. Spells involving undead creatures make up a large part of this school.

@node Transmutation
@subsection Transmutation
@anchor{#transmutation-10}
Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition.

@strong{Polymorph}: A polymorph spell transforms your physical body to take on the shape of another creature. While these spells make you appear to be the creature, granting you a +10 bonus on Disguise skill checks, they do not grant you all of the abilities and powers of the creature. Each polymorph spell allows you to assume the form of a creature of a specific type, granting you a number of bonuses to your ability scores and a bonus to your natural armor. In addition, each polymorph spell can grant you a number of other benefits, including movement types, resistances, and senses. If the form you choose grants these benefits, or a greater ability of the same type, you gain the listed benefit. If the form grants a lesser ability of the same type, you gain the lesser ability instead. Your base speed changes to match that of the form you assume. If the form grants a swim or burrow speed, you maintain the ability to breathe if you are swimming or burrowing. The DC for any of these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell used to change you into that form.

In addition to these benefits, you gain any of the natural attacks of the base creature, including proficiency in those attacks. These attacks are based on your base attack bonus, modified by your [Strength] or [Dexterity] as appropriate, and use your [Strength] modifier for determining damage bonuses.

If a polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers appropriately, changing your armor class, attack bonus, Combat Maneuver Bonus, and Stealth skill modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified by this change unless noted by the spell.

Unless otherwise noted, polymorph spells cannot be used to change into specific individuals. Although many of the fine details can be controlled, your appearance is always that of a generic member of that creature's type. Polymorph spells cannot be used to assume the form of a creature with a template or an advanced version of a creature.

When you cast a polymorph spell that changes you into a creature of the animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type, all of your gear melds into your body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not need to be activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function). Items that require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form. While in such a form, you cannot cast any spells that require material components (unless you have the @ref{#eschew-materials,Eschew Materials} or Natural Spell feat), and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form you choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a dragon. Other polymorph spells might be subject to this restriction as well, if they change you into a form that is unlike your original form (subject to GM discretion). If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your new size.

While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose all extraordinary and supernatural abilities that depend on your original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form. You also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that allow you to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still function. While most of these should be obvious, the GM is the final arbiter of what abilities depend on form and are lost when a new form is assumed. Your new form might restore a number of these abilities if they are possessed by the new form.

You can only be affected by one polymorph spell at a time. If a new polymorph spell is cast on you (or you activate a polymorph effect, such as wild shape), you can decide whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking the place of the old spell. In addition, other spells that change your size have no effect on you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell.

If a polymorph spell is cast on a creature that is smaller than Small or larger than Medium, first adjust its ability scores to one of these two sizes using the following table before applying the bonuses granted by the polymorph spell.

@node [Descriptor]
@section [Descriptor]
@anchor{#descriptor}
Appearing on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a descriptor that further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells have more than one descriptor.

The descriptors are acid, air, chaotic, cold, darkness, death, earth, electricity, evil, fear, fire, force, good, language-dependent, lawful, light, mind-affecting, sonic, and water.

Most of these descriptors have no game effect by themselves, but they govern how the spell interacts with other spells, with special abilities, with unusual creatures, with alignment, and so on.

A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or cannot hear what the caster of a language-dependant spell says, the spell fails.

A mind-affecting spell works only against creatures with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or higher.

@node Level
@section Level
@anchor{#level}
The next line of a spell description gives the spell's level, a number between 0 and 9 that defines the spell's relative power. This number is preceded by a list of classes whose members can cast the spell. A spell's level affects the DC for any save allowed against its effects.

@node Components
@section Components
@anchor{#components}
A spell's components explain what you must do or possess to cast the spell. The components entry in a spell description includes abbreviations that tell you what type of components it requires. Specifics for material and focus components are given at the end of the descriptive text. Usually you don't need to worry about components, but when you can't use a component for some reason or when a material or focus component is expensive, then the components are important.

@strong{Verbal (V)}: A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able to speak in a strong voice. A @emph{silence}spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance of spoiling any spell with a verbal component that he tries to cast.

@strong{Somatic (S)}: A somatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.

@strong{Material (M)}: A material component consists of one or more physical substances or objects that are annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don't bother to keep track of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need as long as you have your spell component pouch.

@strong{Focus (F)}: A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.

@strong{Divine Focus (DF)}: A divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the character's faith. The divine focus for a druid or a ranger is a sprig of holly, or some other sacred plant.

If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the slash).

@node Casting Time
@section Casting Time
@anchor{#casting-time}
Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a swift action.

A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round after you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is completed.

A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1-round casting times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the spell automatically fails.

When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must continue the concentration from the current round to just before your turn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration before the casting is complete, you lose the spell.

A spell with a casting time of 1 swift action doesn't count against your normal limit of one spell per round. However, you may cast such a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a casting time of 1 swift action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target, area, effect, version, and so forth) when the spell comes into effect.

@node Range
@section Range
@anchor{#range}
A spell's range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the range entry of the spell description. A spell's range is the maximum distance from you that the spell's effect can occur, as well as the maximum distance at which you can designate the spell's point of origin. If any portion of the spell's area would extend beyond this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following.

@strong{Personal}: The spell affects only you.

@strong{Touch}: You must touch a creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals damage can score a critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit. Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets. You can touch up to 6 willing targets as part of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in the same round that you finish casting the spell. If the spell allows you to touch targets over multiple rounds, touching 6 creatures is a full-round action.

@strong{Close}: The spell reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases by 5 feet for every two full caster levels.

@strong{Medium}: The spell reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.

@strong{Long}: The spell reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level.

@strong{Unlimited}: The spell reaches anywhere on the same plane of existence.

@strong{Range Expressed in Feet}: Some spells have no standard range category, just a range expressed in feet.

@node Aiming a Spell
@section Aiming a Spell
@anchor{#aiming-a-spell}
You must make choices about whom a spell is to affect or where an effect is to originate, depending on a spell's type. The next entry in a spell description defines the spell's target (or targets), its effect, or its area, as appropriate.

@strong{Target or Targets}: Some spells have a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.

If the target of a spell is yourself (the Target line of the spell description includes “You”), you do not receive a saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply. The saving throw and spell resistance lines are omitted from such spells.

Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at any time (even if you're flat-footed or it isn't your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.

Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Effect}: Some spells create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.

You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, after it appears it can move regardless of the spell's range.

@emph{Ray}: Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don't have to see the creature you're trying to hit, as you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for the creature at which you're aiming.

If a ray spell has a duration, it's the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.

If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.

@emph{Spread}: Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can't see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.

: SpellAreas TODO put this in markdown somehow... a picture of what spell areas

@strong{Area}: Some spells affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.

Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you don't control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.

You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell's area, anything within that square is within the spell's area. If the spell's area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the spell.

@emph{Burst, Emanation, or Spread}: Most spells that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the spell's point of origin and measure its effect from that point.

A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, including creatures that you can't see. It can't affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don't extend around corners). The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst's area defines how far from the point of origin the spell's effect extends.

An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.

A spread spell extends out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account any turns the spell effect takes.

@emph{Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere}: Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape.

A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won't go around corners.

When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell's point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions within its area.

A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares through which the line passes.

A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.

@emph{Creatures}: A spell with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual creatures you select. The area might be a spherical burst, a cone-shaped burst, or some other shape.

Many spells affect “living creatures,” which means all creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in the spell's area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.

@emph{Objects}: A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but affecting objects instead).

@emph{Other}: A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.

@emph{(S) Shapeable}: If an area or effect entry ends with “(S),” you can shape the spell. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater effects and areas.

@strong{Line of Effect}: A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It's like line of sight for ranged weapons, except that it's not blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight.

You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast@emph{.}

A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creature, or object to which it has line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst's center point, a cone-shaped burst's starting point, a cylinder's circle, or an emanation's point of origin).

An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a spell's line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for purposes of a spell's line of effect.

@node Duration
@section Duration
@anchor{#duration}
A spell's duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell lasts.

@strong{Timed Durations}: Many durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or other increments. When the time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell's duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly so the caster doesn't know how long the spell will last.

@strong{Instantaneous}: The spell energy comes and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be long-lasting.

@strong{Permanent}: The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to @emph{dispel magic}.

@strong{Concentration}: The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting a spell can also break your concentration while you're maintaining one, causing the spell to end. See [concentration].

You can't cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Some spells last for a short time after you cease concentrating.

@strong{Subjects, Effects, and Areas}: If the spell affects creatures directly, the result travels with the subjects for the spell's duration. If the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell affects an area, then the spell stays with that area for its duration.

Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.

@strong{Touch Spells and Holding the Charge}: In most cases, if you don't discharge a touch spell on the round you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round until the spell is discharged. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.

Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can't hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell.

@strong{Discharge}: Occasionally a spells lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.

@strong{(D) Dismissible}: If the duration line ends with “(D),” you can dismiss the spell at will. You must be within range of the spell's effect and must speak words of dismissal, which are usually a modified form of the spell's verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

A spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.

@node Saving Throw
@section Saving Throw
@anchor{#saving-throw}
Usually a harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect. The saving throw entry in a spell description defines which type of saving throw the spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell work.

@strong{Negates}: The spell has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.

@strong{Partial}: The spell has an effect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs.

@strong{Half}: The spell deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).

@strong{None}: No saving throw is allowed.

@strong{Disbelief}: A successful save lets the subject ignore the spell's effect.

@strong{(object)}: The spell can be cast on objects, which receive saving throws only if they are magical or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater. This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects. A magic item's saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + 1/2 the item's caster level.

@strong{(harmless)}: The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if it desires.

@strong{Saving Throw Difficulty Class}: A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell + your bonus for the relevant ability for a wizard, [Charisma] for a bard, paladin, or sorcerer, or [Wisdom] for a cleric, druid, or ranger). A spell's level can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell level applicable to your class.

@strong{Succeeding on a Saving Throw}: A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has no obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise, if a creature's saving throw succeeds against a targeted spell, you sense that the spell has failed. You do not sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.

@strong{Automatic Failures and Successes}: A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure, and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.

@strong{Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw}: A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly accept a spell's result. Even a character with a special resistance to magic can suppress this quality.

@strong{Items Surviving after a Saving Throw}: Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects). Refer to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw against the attack form and take whatever damage the attack dealt.

If the selected item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving throw. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.

@node Spell Resistance
@section Spell Resistance
@anchor{#spell-resistance}
Spell resistance is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being resisted by a creature with spell resistance, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the creature's spell resistance for the spell to affect that creature. The defender's spell resistance is like an @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your caster level to this caster level check.

The Spell Resistance entry and the descriptive text of a spell description tell you whether spell resistance protects creatures from the spell. In many cases, spell resistance applies only when a resistant creature is targeted by the spell, not when a resistant creature encounters a spell that is already in place.

The terms “object” and “harmless” mean the same thing for spell resistance as they do for saving throws. A creature with spell resistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard action) in order to be affected by such spells without forcing the caster to make a caster level check.

@node Arcane Spells
@chapter Arcane Spells
@anchor{#arcane-spells}
Wizards, sorcerers, and bards cast arcane spells. Compared to divine spells, arcane spells are more likely to produce dramatic results.

@strong{Spell Slots}: The various character class tables show how many spells of each level a character can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast spells that would otherwise be his due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower levels.

@node Preparing Wizard Spells
@section Preparing Wizard Spells
@anchor{#preparing-wizard-spells}
A wizard's level limits the number of spells he can prepare and cast. His high [Intelligence] score might allow him to prepare a few extra spells. He can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell toward his daily limit. To prepare a spell, the wizard must have an [Intelligence] score of at least 10 + the spell's level.

@strong{Rest}: To prepare his daily spells, a wizard must first sleep for 8 hours. The wizard does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest in order to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing his spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing any spells.

@strong{Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions}: If a wizard has cast spells recently, the drain on his resources reduces his capacity to prepare new spells. When he prepares spells for the coming day, all the spells he has cast within the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.

@strong{Preparation Environment}: To prepare any spell, a wizard must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The wizard's surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from distractions. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character might experience while studying. Wizards also must have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them. There is one major exception: a wizard can prepare a @emph{read magic}spell even without a spellbook.

@strong{Spell Preparation Time}: After resting, a wizard must study his spellbook to prepare any spells that day. If he wants to prepare all his spells, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.

@strong{Spell Selection and Preparation}: Until he prepares spells from his spellbook, the only spells a wizard has available to cast are the ones that he already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, he chooses which spells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells prepared (from the previous day) that he has not cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for new spells.

When preparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day, he can repeat the preparation process as often as he likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of preparation, the wizard can fill these unused spell slots. He cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because he has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard prepares more than one-quarter of his spells.

@strong{Prepared Spell Retention}: Once a wizard prepares a spell, it remains in his mind as a nearly cast spell until he uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger it or until he abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic items or special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a character's mind.

@strong{Death and Prepared Spell Retention}: If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as @emph{raise dead, resurrection,}or @emph{true resurrection}) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the character.

@node Arcane Magical Writings
@section Arcane Magical Writings
@anchor{#arcane-magical-writings}
To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native language or culture. However, each character uses the system in his own way. Another person's magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until he takes time to study and decipher it.

To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in another's spellbook or on a scroll), a character must make a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the spell's level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot attempt to read that particular spell again until the next day. A @emph{read magic}spell automatically deciphers magical writing without a skill check. If the person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader, success is also automatic.

Once a character deciphers a particular piece of magical writing, he does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing is a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, he can attempt to use the scroll.

@node Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks
@subsection Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks
@anchor{#wizard-spells-and-borrowed-spellbooks}
A wizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell he already knows and has recorded in his own spellbook, but preparation success is not assured. First, the wizard must decipher the writing in the book (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Once a spell from another spellcaster's book is deciphered, the reader must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell's level) to prepare the spell. If the check succeeds, the wizard can prepare the spell. He must repeat the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times he has prepared it before. If the check fails, he cannot try to prepare the spell from the same source again until the next day. However, as explained above, he does not need to repeat a check to decipher the writing.

@node Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook
@subsection Adding Spells to a Wizard's Spellbook
@anchor{#adding-spells-to-a-wizards-spellbook}

@verbatim
{#adding-spells-to-a-wizard-s-spellbook}
@end verbatim

Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. A wizard can only learn new spells that belong to the wizard spell lists.

@strong{Spells Gained at a New Level}: Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast. If he has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, one of the two free spells must be from his specialty school.

@strong{Spells Copied from Another's Spellbook or a Scroll}: A wizard can also add a spell to his book whenever he encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard's spellbook. No matter what the spell's source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings). Next, he must spend 1 hour studying the spell. At the end of the hour, he must make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell's level). A wizard who has specialized in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus on the Spellcraft check if the new spell is from his specialty school. If the check succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy it into his spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook). The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.

If the check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the spell. He cannot attempt to learn or copy that spell again until one week has passed. If the spell was from a scroll, a failed Spellcraft check does not cause the spell to vanish.

In most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to half the cost to write the spell into a spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook). Rare and unique spells might cost significantly more.

@strong{Independent Research}: A wizard can also research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely new one. The cost to research a new spell, and the time required, are left up to GM discretion, but it should probably take at least 1 week and cost at least 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be researched. This should also require a number of Spellcraft and Knowledge (arcana) checks.

@verbatim
{#writing-a-new-spell-into-a-spellbook-69}

Once a wizard understands a new spell, he can record it into his spellbook.

@strong{Time}: The process takes 1 hour per spell level. Cantrips (0 levels spells) take 30 minutes to record.

@strong{Space in the Spellbook}: A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level. Even a 0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has 100 pages.

@strong{Materials and Costs}: The cost for writing a new spell into a spellbook depends on the level of the spell, as noted on the following table. Note that a wizard does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for spells he gains for free at each new level.

@node Replacing and Copying Spellbooks
@subsection Replacing and Copying Spellbooks
@anchor{#replacing-and-copying-spellbooks}
A wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If he already has a particular spell prepared, he can write it directly into a new book at the same cost required to write a spell into a spellbook. The process wipes the prepared spell from his mind, just as casting it would. If he does not have the spell prepared, he can prepare it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.

Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as replacing it, but the task is much easier. The time requirement and cost per page are halved.

@node Selling a Spellbook
@subsection Selling a Spellbook
@anchor{#selling-a-spellbook}
Captured spellbooks can be sold for an amount equal to half the cost of purchasing and inscribing the spells within.

@node Sorcerers and Bards
@section Sorcerers and Bards
@anchor{#sorcerers-and-bards}
Sorcerers and bards cast arcane spells, but they do not use spellbooks or prepare spells. Their class level limits the number of spells she can cast (see these class descriptions). Her high [Charisma] score might allow her to cast a few extra spells. A member of either class must have a [Charisma] score of at least 10 + the spell's level to cast the spell.

@strong{Daily Readying of Spells}: Each day, sorcerers and bards must focus their minds on the task of casting their spells. A sorcerer or bard needs 8 hours of rest (just like a wizard), after which she spends 15 minutes concentrating. (A bard must sing, recite, or play an instrument of some kind while concentrating.) During this period, the sorcerer or bard readies her mind to cast her daily allotment of spells. Without such a period to refresh herself, the character does not regain the spell slots she used up the day before.

@strong{Recent Casting Limit}: Any spells cast within the last 8 hours count against the sorcerer's or bard's daily limit.

@strong{Adding Spells to a Sorcerer's or Bard's Repertoire}: A sorcerer or bard gains spells each time she attains a new level in her class and never gains spells any other way. When your sorcerer or bard gains a new level, consult Table: Bard Spells Known or Table: Sorcerer Spells Known to learn how many spells from the appropriate spell list she now knows. With permission from the GM, sorcerers and bards can also select the spells they gain from new and unusual spells that they come across while adventuring.

@node Divine Spells
@chapter Divine Spells
@anchor{#divine-spells}
Clerics, druids, experienced paladins, and experienced rangers can cast divine spells. Unlike arcane spells, divine spells draw power from a divine source. Clerics gain spell power from deities or from divine forces. The divine force of nature powers druid and ranger spells, and the divine forces of law and good power paladin spells. Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection and are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.

@node Preparing Divine Spells
@section Preparing Divine Spells
@anchor{#preparing-divine-spells}
Divine spellcasters prepare their spells in largely the same manner as wizards do, but with a few differences. The relevant ability for most divine spells is [Wisdom] for paladins). To prepare a divine spell, a character must have a [Wisdom] score (or [Charisma] score for paladins) of 10 + the spell's level. Likewise, bonus spells are based on [Wisdom].

@strong{Time of Day}: A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, does not require a period of rest to prepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular time of day to pray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, she must do so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray for spells at the first opportunity, she must wait until the next day to prepare spells.

@strong{Spell Selection and Preparation}: A divine spellcaster selects and prepares spells ahead of time through prayer and meditation at a particular time of day. The time required to prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. When preparing spells for the day, a cleric can leave some of her spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes. During these extra sessions of preparation, she can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if she prepares more than one-quarter of his spells.

Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, a divine spellcaster's spell selection is limited to the spells on the list for her class. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers have separate spell lists. A cleric also has access to two domains determined during character creation. Each domain gives her access to a number of special abilities and bonus spells.

@strong{Spell Slots}: The character class tables show how many spells of each level each can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast spells that would otherwise be her due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower levels.

@strong{Recent Casting Limit}: As with arcane spells, at the time of preparation any spells cast within the previous 8 hours count against the number of spells that can be prepared.

@strong{Spontaneous Casting of Cure} @strong{and Inflict} @strong{Spells}: A good cleric (or a cleric of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a cure spell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher, but not in place of a bonus domain spell. An evil cleric (or a cleric of an evil deity) can spontaneously cast an inflict spell in place of a prepared spell (that is not a domain spell) of the same level or higher. Each neutral cleric of a neutral deity spontaneously casts either cure spells like a good cleric or inflict spells like an evil one, depending on which option the player chooses when creating the character. The divine energy of the spell that the cure or inflict spell substitutes for is converted into the cure or inflict spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.

@strong{Spontaneous Casting of @emph{Summon Nature's Ally} Spells}: A druid can spontaneously cast @emph{summon nature's ally}in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The divine energy of the spell that the summon spell substitutes for is converted as if that spell had been prepared all along.

@node Divine Magical Writings
@section Divine Magical Writings
@anchor{#divine-magical-writings}
Divine spells can be written and deciphered like arcane spells (see Arcane Magical Writings). A Spellcraft check can decipher divine magical writing and identify it. Only characters who have the spell (in its divine form) on their class spell list can cast a divine spell from a scroll.

@node New Divine Spells
@section New Divine Spells
@anchor{#new-divine-spells}
Divine spellcasters gain new spells as follows.

@strong{Spells Gained at a New Level}: Characters who can cast divine spells undertake a certain amount of study between adventures. Each time such a character receives a new level of divine spells, she learns all of the spells from that level automatically.

@strong{Independent Research}: A divine spellcaster can also research a spell independently, much as an arcane spellcaster can. Only the creator of such a spell can prepare and cast it, unless she decides to share it with others.

@node Special Abilities
@chapter Special Abilities
@anchor{#special-abilities}
A number of classes and creatures gain the use of special abilities, many of which function like spells.

@strong{Spell-Like Abilities}: Usually, a spell-like ability works just like the spell of that name. A spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it require a focus. The user activates it mentally. Armor never affects a spell-like ability's use, even if the ability resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.

A spell-like ability has a casting time of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell description. In all other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.

Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and @emph{dispel magic}. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.

If a character class grants a spell-like ability that is not based on an actual spell, the ability's effective spell level is equal to the highest-level class spell the character can cast, and is cast at the class level the ability is granted.

@strong{Supernatural Abilities}: These can't be disrupted in combat and generally don't provoke attacks of opportunity. They aren't subject to spell resistance, counterspells, or @emph{dispel magic}, and don't function in antimagic areas.

@strong{Extraordinary Abilities}: These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as spells can, and they generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities. They are not subject to dispelling, and they function normally in an @emph{antimagic field.}Indeed, extraordinary abilities do not qualify as magical, though they may break the laws of physics.

@strong{Natural Abilities}: This category includes abilities a creature has because of its physical nature. Natural abilities are those not otherwise designated as extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like.

Of all the strange places that an adventurer might explore, none is deadlier than the dungeon. These labyrinths, full of deadly traps, hungry monsters, and priceless treasure, test every skill a character possesses. These rules can apply to dungeons of any type, from the wreck of a sunken ship to a vast cave complex.

@section Types of Dungeons
@anchor{#types-of-dungeons}
The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current status. Many dungeons are variations on these basic types or combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by different inhabitants for different purposes.

@strong{Ruined Structure}: Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its original creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in. Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground constructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist have probably been set off, but wandering beasts might very well be common.

@strong{Occupied Structure}: This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live there, although they might not be the dungeon's creators. An occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organized guards---both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that might be encountered are usually under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit the inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around. The inhabitants might have a communication system, and they almost certainly control an exit to the outside.

Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in ruins. In such cases, the occupants are typically not the original builders, but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up their base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.

@strong{Safe Storage}: When people want to protect something, they sometimes bury it underground. Whether the item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a forbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, traps, and guardians.

The safe storage dungeon is the most likely to have traps but the least likely to have wandering beasts. This type of dungeon is normally built for function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important people.

Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Builders of vaults or tombs often use undead creatures or constructs, both of which have no need for sustenance or rest, to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning monsters into the dungeon that disappear when their task is done.

@strong{Natural Cavern Complex}: Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters. Created naturally and connected by labyrinthine tunnel systems, these caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no intelligent force behind its construction, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have traps or even doors.

Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms and puffballs. Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for weaker creatures feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of fungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited light source. In other areas, a @emph{daylight}spell or similar magical effect can provide enough light for green plants to grow.

Natural cavern complexes often connect with other types of dungeons, the caves having been discovered when the manufactured dungeons were delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a strange mixed environment. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often provides a route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a manufactured dungeon and populate it.

@node Walls
@subsection Walls
@anchor{#walls}
Masonry walls---stones piled on top of each other, usually but not always held in place with mortar---often divide dungeons into corridors and chambers. Dungeon walls can also be hewn from solid rock, leaving them with a rough, chiseled look. Still other dungeon walls can be the smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally occurring cave. Dungeon walls are difficult to break down or through, but they're generally easy to climb.

1 Per 10-foot-by-10-foot section.

2 This modifier can be applied to any of the other wall types.

3 Or an additional 50 hit points, whichever is greater.

@strong{Masonry Walls}: The most common kind of dungeon wall, masonry walls are usually at least 1 foot thick. Often, these ancient walls sport cracks and crevices, and sometimes dangerous slimes or small monsters live in these areas and wait for prey. Masonry walls stop all but the loudest noises. It takes a DC 20 Climb check to travel along a masonry wall.

@strong{Superior Masonry Walls}: Sometimes masonry walls are better built (smoother, with tighter-fitting stones and less cracking), and occasionally these superior walls are covered with plaster or stucco. Covered walls often bear paintings, carved reliefs, or other decoration. Superior masonry walls are no more difficult to destroy than regular masonry walls but are more difficult to climb (DC 25).

@strong{Reinforced Masonry Walls}: These are masonry walls with iron bars on one or both sides of the wall, or placed within the wall to strengthen it. The hardness of a reinforced wall remains the same, but its hit points are doubled and the Strength check DC to break through it is increased by 10.

@strong{Hewn Stone Walls}: Such walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from solid rock. The rough surface of a hewn wall frequently provides minuscule ledges where fungus grows and fissures where vermin, bats, and subterranean snakes live. When such a wall has an “other side” (meaning it separates two chambers in the dungeon), the wall is usually at least 3 feet thick; anything thinner risks collapsing from the weight of all the stone overhead. It takes a DC 25 Climb check to climb a hewn stone wall.

@strong{Unworked Stone Walls}: These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch but filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various heights. They're also usually wet or at least damp, since it's water that most frequently creates natural caves. When such a wall has an “other side,” the wall is usually at least 5 feet thick. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to move along an unworked stone wall.

@strong{Iron Walls}: These walls are placed within dungeons around important places, such as vaults.

@strong{Paper Walls}: Paper walls are placed as screens to block line of sight, but nothing more.

@strong{Wooden Walls}: Wooden walls often exist as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create animal pens, storage bins, and temporary structures, or just to make a number of smaller rooms out of a larger one.

@strong{Magically Treated Walls}: These walls are stronger than average, with a greater hardness, more hit points, and a higher break DC. Magic can usually double the hardness and hit points of a wall and add up to 20 to the break DC. A magically treated wall also gains a saving throw against spells that could affect it, with the save bonus equaling 2 + 1/2 the caster level of the magic reinforcing the wall. Creating a magic wall requires the [Craft Wondrous Item] feat and the expenditure of 1,500 gp for each 10-foot-by-10-foot wall section.

@strong{Walls with Arrow Slits}: Walls with arrow slits can be made of any durable material but are most commonly masonry, hewn stone, or wood. Such a wall allows defenders to fire arrows or crossbow bolts at intruders from behind the safety of the wall. Archers behind arrow slits have improved cover that gives them a +8 bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, a +4 bonus on [Reflex] saves, and the benefits of the improved evasion class feature.

@node Floors
@subsection Floors
@anchor{#floors}
As with walls, dungeon floors come in many types.

@strong{Flagstone}: Like masonry walls, flagstone floors are made of fitted stones. They are usually cracked and only somewhat level. Slime and mold grows in the cracks. Sometimes water runs in rivulets between the stones or sits in stagnant puddles. Flagstone is the most common dungeon floor.

@strong{Uneven Flagstone}: Over time, some floors can become so uneven that a DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across the surface. Failure means the character can't move that round. Floors as treacherous as this should be the exception, not the rule.

@strong{Hewn Stone Floors}: Rough and uneven, hewn floors are usually covered with loose stones, gravel, dirt, or other debris. A DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across such a floor. Failure means the character can still act, but can't run or charge in this round.

@strong{Light Rubble}: Small chunks of debris litter the ground. Light rubble adds 2 to the DC of Acrobatics checks.

@strong{Dense Rubble}: The ground is covered with debris of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks, and it adds 2 to the DC of Stealth checks.

@strong{Smooth Stone Floors}: Finished and sometimes even polished, smooth floors are found only in dungeons made by capable and careful builders.

@strong{Natural Stone Floors}: The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. Caves rarely have flat surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many levels. Some adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a foot, so that moving from one to the other is no more difficult than negotiating a stair step, but in other places the floor might suddenly drop off or rise up several feet or more, requiring Climb checks to get from one surface to the other. Unless a path has been worn and well marked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2 squares of movement to enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 5. Running and charging are impossible, except along paths.

@strong{Slippery}: Water, ice, slime, or blood can make any of the dungeon floors described in this section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5.

@strong{Grate}: A grate often covers a pit or an area lower than the main floor. Grates are usually made from iron, but large ones can also be made from iron-bound timbers. Many grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below (such grates can be locked like any door), while others are permanent and designed to not move. A typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit points, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for Strength checks to break through it or tear it loose.

@strong{Ledge}: Ledges allow creatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits, run along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or provide a place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below. Narrow ledges (12 inches wide or less) require those moving along them to make Acrobatics checks. Failure results in the moving character falling off the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings along the wall. In such a case, characters gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move along the ledge. A character who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance bonus on his opposed Strength check to avoid being bull rushed off the edge.

Ledges can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their edges. Such walls provide cover against attackers within 30 feet on the other side of the wall, as long as the target is closer to the low wall than the attacker is.

@strong{Transparent Floor}: Transparent floors, made of reinforced glass or magic materials (even a @emph{wall of force}), allow a dangerous setting to be viewed safely from above. Transparent floors are sometimes placed over lava pools, arenas, monster dens, and torture chambers. They can be used by defenders to watch key areas for intruders.

@strong{Sliding Floors}: A sliding floor is a type of trap door, designed to be moved and thus reveal something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so slowly that anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it creates, assuming there's somewhere else to go. If such a floor slides quickly enough that there's a chance of a character falling into whatever lies beneath---a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool filled with sharks---then it's a trap.

@strong{Trap Floors}: Some floors are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application of just the right amount of weight, or the pull of a lever somewhere nearby, spikes protrude from the floor, gouts of steam or flame shoot up from hidden holes, or the entire floor tilts. These strange floors are sometimes found in arenas, designed to make combats more exciting and deadly. Construct these floors as you would any other trap.

* DC to lift. Use appropriate door figure for breaking.

@strong{Wooden Doors}: Constructed of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for strength (and to reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden doors are the most common type. Wooden doors come in varying strengths: simple, good, and strong. Simple doors (break DC 15) are not meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good doors (break DC 18), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment. Strong doors (break DC 25) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well-maintained (not stuck) and unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.

@strong{Stone}: Carved from solid blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that they pivot when opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up a stone door. Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone doors. Otherwise, such doors stand as tough barriers protecting something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or barred.

@strong{Iron}: Rusted but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors are the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked or barred.

@strong{Breaking Doors}: Dungeon doors might be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually knock down a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer, and a number of spells and magic items give characters an easy way around a locked door.

Attempts to literally chop down a door with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and hit points given in Table: Doors. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines.

@emph{DC 10 or Lower}: a door just about anyone can break open.

@emph{DC 11--15}: a door that a strong person could break with one try and an average person might be able to break with one try.

@emph{DC 16--20}: a door that almost anyone could break, given time.

@emph{DC 21--25}: a door that only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably not on the first try.

@emph{DC 26 or Higher}: a door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.

@strong{Locks}: Dungeon doors are often locked, and thus the Disable Device skill comes in very handy. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Built-in locks either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or iron doors).

The Disable Device DC to pick a lock often falls within the range of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to prick a rogue's finger.

Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere.

A special door might have a lock with no key, instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open the door.

@strong{Stuck Doors}: Dungeons are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors. Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of non-wooden doors are stuck. These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively) for long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.

@strong{Barred Doors}: When characters try to bash down a barred door, it's the quality of the bar that matters, not the material the door is made of. It takes a DC 25 Strength check to break through a door with a wooden bar, and a DC 30 Strength check if the bar is made of iron. Characters can attack the door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar hanging in the now-open doorway.

@strong{Magic Seals}: Spells such as @emph{arcane lock}can discourage passage through a door. A door with an @emph{arcane lock}spell on it is considered locked even if it doesn't have a physical lock. It takes a @emph{knock}spell, a @emph{dispel magic}spell, or a successful Strength check to open such a door.

@strong{Hinges}: Most doors have hinges, but sliding doors do not. They usually have tracks or grooves instead, allowing them to slide easily to one side.

@emph{Standard Hinges}: These hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the door frame or wall. Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the hinges. (So, if the hinges are on the PCs' side, the door opens toward them; otherwise it opens away from them.) Adventurers can take the hinges apart one at a time with successful Disable Device checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the door, of course). Such a task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The break DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down the door.

@emph{Nested Hinges}: These hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs can't get at the hinges to fool with them unless they break through the door frame or wall. Nested hinges are typically found on stone doors but sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well.

@emph{Pivots}: Pivots aren't really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom of the door that fit into holes in the door frame, allowing the door to spin. The advantages of pivots are that they can't be dismantled like hinges and they're simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door's width can fit through without squeezing. Doors with pivots are usually stone and often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls often turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide the door's presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as secret doors.

@strong{Secret Doors}: Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor or ceiling), a bookcase, a fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or room. Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on a successful Perception check (DC 20 for a typical secret door to DC 30 for a well-hidden secret door).

Many secret doors require special methods of opening, such as hidden buttons or pressure plates. Secret doors can open like normal doors, or they might pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a drawbridge to permit access. Builders might put a secret door low near the floor or high in a wall, making it difficult to find or reach. Wizards and sorcerers have a spell, @emph{phase door}, that allows them to create a magic secret door that only they can use.

@strong{Magic Doors}: Enchanted by the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning them away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus against @emph{disintegrate}and similar spells. A magic door might not lead into the space behind it, but instead might be a portal to a faraway place or even another plane of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or special keys to open them.

@strong{Portcullises}: These special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound wooden shafts that descend from recesses in the ceilings above archways. Sometimes a portcullis has crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically raised by means of a winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped quickly, and the shafts end in spikes to discourage anyone from standing underneath (or from attempting to dive under it as it drops). Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a typical portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.

@node Walls Doors and Detect Spells
@subsection Walls, Doors, and Detect Spells
@anchor{#walls-doors-and-detect-spells}
Stone walls, iron walls, and iron doors are usually thick enough to block most detect spells, such as @emph{detect thoughts.}Wooden walls, wooden doors, and stone doors are usually not thick enough to do so. A secret stone door built into a wall and as thick as the wall itself (at least 1 foot) does block most detect spells.

@node Stairs
@subsection Stairs
@anchor{#stairs}
Stairs are the most common means of traveling up and down within a dungeon. A character can move up or down stairs as part of their movement without penalty, but they cannot run on them. Increase the DC of any Acrobatics skill check made on stairs by 4. Some stairs are particularly steep and are treated as difficult terrain.

@node Cave-Ins and Collapses CR 8
@subsection Cave-Ins and Collapses (CR 8)
@anchor{#cave-ins-and-collapses-cr-8}
Cave-ins and collapsing tunnels are extremely dangerous. Not only do dungeon explorers face the danger of being crushed by tons of falling rock, but even if they survive they might be buried beneath a pile of rubble or cut off from the only known exit. A cave-in buries anyone in the middle of the collapsing area, and then sliding debris damages anyone in the periphery of the collapse. A typical corridor subject to a cave-in might have a bury zone with a 15-foot radius and a 10-foot-wide slide zone extending beyond the bury zone. A weakened ceiling can be spotted with a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) or DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. Remember that Craft checks can be made untrained as [Intelligence] checks. A dwarf can make such a check if he simply passes within 10 feet of a weakened ceiling.

A weakened ceiling might collapse when subjected to a major impact or concussion. A character can cause a cave-in by destroying half the pillars holding up the ceiling.

Characters in the bury zone of a cave-in take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 [Reflex] save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage at all if they make a DC 15 [Reflex] save. Characters in the slide zone who fail their saves are buried.

Characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls [unconscious], he must make a DC 15 [Constitution] check each minute. If it fails, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead.

Characters who aren't buried can dig out their friends. In 1 minute, using only her hands, a character can clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs 1 ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand. A buried character can attempt to free himself with a DC 25 Strength check.

@node Slimes Molds and Fungi
@subsection Slimes, Molds, and Fungi
@anchor{#slimes-molds-and-fungi}
In a dungeon's damp, dark recesses, molds and fungi thrive. For purposes of spells and other special effects, all slimes, molds, and fungi are treated as plants. Like traps, dangerous slimes and molds have CRs, and characters earn XP for encountering them.

A form of glistening organic sludge coats almost anything that remains in the damp and dark for too long. This kind of slime, though it might be repulsive, is not dangerous. Molds and fungi flourish in dark, cool, damp places. While some are as inoffensive as the normal dungeon slime, others are quite dangerous. Mushrooms, puffballs, yeasts, mildew, and other sorts of bulbous, fibrous, or flat patches of fungi can be found throughout most dungeons. They are usually inoffensive, and some are even edible (although most are unappealing or odd-tasting).

@strong{Brown Mold (CR 2)}: Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. It normally comes in patches 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is always cold in a 30-foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5 feet of it take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought within 5 feet of brown mold causes the mold to instantly double in size. Cold damage, such as from a @emph{cone of cold,}instantly destroys it.

@strong{Green Slime (CR 4)}: This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below.

A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of [Constitution] damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as well). Anything that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a @emph{remove disease}spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring metal's hardness but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.

@strong{Phosphorescent Fungus}: This strange underground fungus gives off a soft violet glow that illuminates underground caverns and passages as well as a candle does. Rare patches of fungus illuminate as well as a torch does.

@strong{Shrieker}: This human-sized purple mushroom emits a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds whenever there is movement or a light source within 10 feet. This shriek makes it impossible to hear any other sound within 50 feet. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers learn that this noise means there is food or an intruder nearby.

@strong{Yellow Mold (CR 6)}: If disturbed, a 5-foot square of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a DC 15 [Fortitude] save or take 1d3 points of [Constitution] damage. Another DC 15 [Fortitude] save is required once per round for the next 5 rounds, to avoid taking 1d3 points of [Constitution] damage each round. A successful [Fortitude] save ends this effect. Fire destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders it dormant.

@subsection Type
@anchor{#type}
A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature.

@strong{Mechanical}: Dungeons are frequently equipped with deadly mechanical (nonmagical) traps. A trap typically is defined by its location and triggering conditions, how hard it is to spot before it goes off, how much damage it deals, and whether or not the characters receive a saving throw to mitigate its effects. Traps that attack with arrows, sweeping blades, and other types of weaponry make normal attack rolls, with specific attack bonuses dictated by the trap's design. A mechanical trap can be constructed by a PC through successful use of the Craft (traps) skill and the [Craft skill description]).

Creatures that succeed on a Perception check detect a trap before it is triggered. The DC of this check depends on the trap itself. Success generally indicates that the creature has detected the mechanism that activates the trap, such as a pressure plate, odd gears attached to a door handle, and the like. Beating this check by 5 or more also gives some indication of what the trap is designed to do.

@strong{Magic}: Many spells can be used to create dangerous traps. Unless the spell or item description states otherwise, assume the following to be true.

@itemize
@item
A successful Perception check (DC 25 + spell level) detects a magic trap before it goes off.
@item
Magic traps permit a saving throw in order to avoid the effect (DC 10 + spell level × 1.5).
@item
Magic traps may be disarmed by a character with the trapfinding class feature with a successful Disable Device skill check (DC 25 + spell level). Other characters have no chance to disarm a magic trap with a Disable Device check.
@end itemize

Magic traps are further divided into spell traps and magic device traps. Magic device traps initiate spell effects when activated, just as wands, rods, rings, and other magic items do. Creating a magic device trap requires the [Craft Wondrous Item] feat.

Spell traps are simply spells that themselves function as traps@emph{.}Creating a spell trap requires the services of a character who can cast the needed spell or spells, who is usually either the character creating the trap or an NPC spellcaster hired for that purpose.

@node Perception and Disable Device DCs
@subsection Perception and Disable Device DCs
@anchor{#perception-and-disable-device-dcs}
The builder sets the Perception and Disable Device DCs for a mechanical trap. For a magic trap, the values depend on the highest-level spell used.

@strong{Mechanical Trap}: The base DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is 20. Raising or lowering either of these DCs affects the CR (Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps).

@strong{Magic Trap}: The DC for both Perception and Disable Device checks is equal to 25 + the spell level of the highest-level spell used. Only characters with the trapfinding class feature can attempt a Disable Device check involving a magic trap.

@node Trigger
@subsection Trigger
@anchor{#trigger}
A trap's trigger determines how it is sprung.

@strong{Location}: A location trigger springs a trap when someone stands in a particular square.

@strong{Proximity}: This trigger activates the trap when a creature approaches within a certain distance of it. A proximity trigger differs from a location trigger in that the creature need not be standing in a particular square. Creatures that are flying can spring a trap with a proximity trigger but not one with a location trigger. Mechanical proximity triggers are extremely sensitive to the slightest change in the air. This makes them useful only in places such as crypts, where the air is unusually still.

The proximity trigger used most often for magic device traps is the @emph{alarm}spell. Unlike when the spell is cast, an @emph{alarm}spell used as a trigger can have an area that's no larger than the area the trap is meant to protect.

Some magic device traps have special proximity triggers that activate only when certain kinds of creatures approach. For example, a @emph{detect good}spell can serve as a proximity trigger on an evil altar, springing the attached trap only when someone of good alignment gets close enough to it.

@strong{Sound}: This trigger springs a magic trap when it detects any sound. A sound trigger functions like an ear and has a +15 bonus on Perception checks. A successful Stealth check, magical @emph{silence,}and other effects that would negate hearing defeat it. A trap with a sound trigger requires the casting of @emph{clairaudience}during its construction.

@strong{Visual}: This trigger for magic traps works like an actual eye, springing the trap whenever it “sees” something. A trap with a visual trigger requires the casting of @emph{arcane eye, clairvoyance,}or @emph{true seeing}during its construction. Sight range and the Perception bonus conferred on the trap depend on the spell chosen, as shown.

@multitable {@emph{clairvoyance}} {Line of sight (unlimited range)} {Perception Bonus} 
@headitem 
Spell
 @tab Sight Range
 @tab Perception Bonus

@emph{clairvoyance}
 @tab One preselected location
 @tab +15
@item 
@emph{true seeing}
 @tab Line of sight (up to 120 ft.)
 @tab +30
@end multitable

If you want the trap to see in the dark, you must either choose the @emph{true seeing}option or add @emph{darkvision}to the trap as well. (@emph{Darkvision}limits the trap's sight range in the dark to 60 feet.) If invisibility, disguises, or illusions can fool the spell being used, they can fool the visual trigger as well.

@strong{Touch}: A touch trigger, which springs the trap when touched, is one of the simplest kinds of trigger to construct. This trigger may be physically attached to the part of the mechanism that deals the damage or it may not. You can make a magic touch trigger by adding @emph{alarm}to the trap and reducing the area of the effect to cover only the trigger spot.

@strong{Timed}: This trigger periodically springs the trap after a certain duration has passed.

@strong{Spell}: All spell traps have this kind of trigger. The appropriate spell descriptions explain the trigger conditions for traps that contain spell triggers.

@node Duration
@subsection Duration
@anchor{#duration-1}
Unless otherwise stated, most traps have a duration of instantaneous; once triggered, they have their effect and then stop functioning. Some traps have a duration measured in rounds. Such traps continue to have their listed effect each round at the top of the initiative order (or whenever they were activated, if they were triggered during combat).

@node Reset
@subsection Reset
@anchor{#reset}
A reset element is the set of conditions under which a trap becomes ready to trigger again. Resetting a trap usually takes only a minute or so. For a trap with a more difficult reset method, you should set the time and labor required.

@strong{No Reset}: Short of completely rebuilding the trap, there's no way to trigger it more than once. Spell traps have no reset element.

@strong{Repair}: To get the trap functioning again, you must repair it. Repairing a mechanical trap requires a Craft (traps) check against a DC equal to the one for building it. The cost for raw materials is one-fifth of the trap's original market price. To calculate how long it takes to fix a trap, use the same calculations you would for building it, but use the cost of the raw materials required for repair in place of the market price.

@strong{Manual}: Resetting the trap requires someone to move the parts back into place. This is the kind of reset element most mechanical traps have.

@strong{Automatic}: The trap resets itself, either immediately or after a timed interval.

@node Bypass Optional Element
@subsection Bypass (Optional Element)
@anchor{#bypass-optional-element}
If the builder of a trap wants to be able to move past the trap after it is created or placed, it's a good idea to build in a bypass mechanism: something that temporarily disarms the trap. Bypass elements are typically used only with mechanical traps; spell traps usually have built-in allowances for the caster to bypass them.

@strong{Lock}: A lock bypass requires a DC 30 Disable Device check to open.

@strong{Hidden Switch}: A hidden switch requires a DC 25 Perception check to locate.

@strong{Hidden Lock}: A hidden lock combines the features above, requiring a DC 25 Perception check to locate and a DC 30 Disable Device check to open.

@node Effect
@subsection Effect
@anchor{#effect}
The effect of a trap is what happens to those who spring it. This often takes the form of either damage or a spell effect, but some traps have special effects. A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a saving throw to avoid it. Occasionally a trap uses both of these options, or neither (see Never Miss).

@strong{Pits}: These are holes (covered or not) that characters can fall into, causing them to take damage. A pit needs no attack roll, but a successful [Reflex] save (DC set by the builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical traps also fall into this category. Falling into a pit deals 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of depth.

Pits in dungeons come in three basic varieties: uncovered, covered, and chasms. Pits and chasms can be defeated by judicious application of the Acrobatics skill, the Climb skill, or various mechanical or magical means.

Uncovered pits and natural chasms serve mainly to discourage intruders from going a certain way, although they cause much grief to characters who stumble into them in the dark, and they can greatly complicate nearby melee.

Covered pits are much more dangerous. They can be detected with a DC 20 Perception check, but only if the character is taking the time to carefully examine the area before walking across it. A character who fails to detect a covered pit is still entitled to a DC 20 [Reflex] save to avoid falling into it. If she was running or moving recklessly at the time, however, she gets no saving throw and falls automatically.

Trap coverings can be as simple as piled refuse (straw, leaves, sticks, garbage), a large rug, or an actual trap door concealed to appear as a normal part of the floor. Such a trap door usually swings open when enough weight (usually about 50 to 80 pounds) is placed upon it. Devious trap builders sometimes design trap doors so they spring back shut after they open. The trap door might lock once it's back in place, leaving the stranded character well and truly trapped. Opening such a trap door is just as difficult as opening a regular door (assuming the trapped character can reach it), and a DC 13 Strength check is needed to keep a spring-loaded door open.

Pit traps often have something nastier than just a hard floor at the bottom. A trap designer might put spikes, monsters, or a pool of acid, lava, or even water at the bottom. For rules on pit spikes and other such add-ons, see the @ref{#miscellaneous-trap-features,Miscellaneous Trap Features} section.

Monsters sometimes live in pits. Any monster that can fit into the pit might have been placed there by the dungeon's designer, or might simply have fallen in and not been able to climb back out.

A secondary trap, mechanical or magical, at the bottom of a pit can be particularly deadly. Activated by a falling victim, the secondary trap attacks the already injured character when she's least ready for it.

@strong{Ranged Attack Traps}: These traps fling darts, arrows, spears, or the like at whomever activated the trap. The builder sets the attack bonus. A ranged attack trap can be configured to simulate the effect of a composite bow with a high Strength rating, which provides the trap with a bonus on damage equal to its Strength rating. These traps deal whatever damage their ammunition normally does. If a trap is constructed with a high Strength rating, it has a corresponding bonus on damage.

@strong{Melee Attack Traps}: These traps feature such obstacles as sharp blades that emerge from walls and stone blocks that fall from ceilings. Once again, the builder sets the attack bonus. These traps deal the same damage as the melee weapons they “wield.” In the case of a falling stone block, you can assign any amount of bludgeoning damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the trap has to lift that stone back into place.

A melee attack trap can be constructed with a built-in bonus on damage rolls, just as if the trap itself had a high Strength score.

@strong{Spell Traps}: Spell traps produce the spell's effect@emph{.}Like all spells, a spell trap that allows a saving throw has a save DC of 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability modifier.

@strong{Magic Device Traps}: These traps produce the effects of any spells included in their construction, as described in the appropriate entries@emph{.}If the spell in a magic device trap allows a saving throw, its save DC is (10 + spell level) × 1.5. Some spells make attack rolls instead.

@strong{Special}: Some traps have miscellaneous features that produce special effects, such as drowning for a water trap or ability damage for poison. Saving throws and damage depend on the poison or are set by the builder, as appropriate.

@node Miscellaneous Trap Features
@subsection Miscellaneous Trap Features
@anchor{#miscellaneous-trap-features}
Some traps include optional features that can make them considerably more deadly. The most common features are discussed below.

@strong{Alchemical Item}: Mechanical traps might incorporate alchemical devices or other special substances or items, such as tanglefoot bags, alchemist's fire, thunderstones, and the like. Some such items mimic spell effects. If the item mimics a spell effect, it increases the CR as shown on Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps.

@strong{Gas}: With a gas trap, the danger is in the inhaled poison it delivers. Traps employing gas usually have the never miss and onset delay features.

@strong{Liquid}: Any trap that involves a danger of drowning is in this category. Traps employing liquid usually have the never miss and onset delay features.

@strong{Multiple Targets}: Traps with this feature can affect more than one character.

@strong{Never Miss}: When the entire dungeon wall moves to crush you, your quick reflexes won't help, since the wall can't possibly miss. A trap with this feature has neither an attack bonus nor a saving throw to avoid, but it does have an onset delay. Most traps involving liquid or gas are of the never miss variety.

@strong{Onset Delay}: An onset delay is the amount of time between when the trap is sprung and when it deals damage. A never miss trap always has an onset delay.

@strong{Poison}: Traps that employ [poison] are deadlier than their nonpoisonous counterparts, so they have correspondingly higher CRs. To determine the CR modifier for a given poison, consult Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps. Only injury, contact, and inhaled poisons are suitable for traps; ingested types are not. Some traps simply deal the poison's damage. Others deal damage with ranged or melee attacks as well.

@strong{Pit Spikes}: Treat spikes at the bottom of a pit as daggers, each with a +10 attack bonus. The damage bonus for each spike is +1 per 10 feet of pit depth (to a maximum of +5). Each character who falls into the pit is attacked by 1d4 spikes. This damage is in addition to any damage from the fall itself, and the statistics presented above are merely the most common variant---some traps might have far more dangerous spikes at their bottom. Pit spikes add to the average damage of the trap (see Average Damage, below).

@strong{Pit Bottom}: If something other than spikes waits at the bottom of a pit, it's best to treat that as a separate trap (see Multiple Traps) with a location trigger that activates on any significant impact, such as a falling character.

@strong{Touch Attack}: This feature applies to any trap that needs only a successful touch attack (melee or ranged) to hit.

@strong{Mechanical Traps}: Simply select the elements you want the trap to have and add up the adjustments to the trap's Challenge Rating that those elements require (see Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps) to arrive at the trap's final CR. From the CR you can derive the DC of the Craft (traps) checks a character must make to construct the trap.

@strong{Magic Traps}: As with mechanical traps, decide what elements you want and then determine the CR of the resulting trap (see CR Modifiers for Magic Traps). If a player character wants to design and construct a magic trap, he, or an ally, must have the [Craft Wondrous Item] feat. In addition, he must be able to cast the spell or spells that the trap requires---or he must be able to hire an NPC to cast the spells for him.

@node Challenge Rating of a Trap
@subsection Challenge Rating of a Trap
@anchor{#challenge-rating-of-a-trap}
To calculate the Challenge Rating of a trap, add all the CR modifiers (see Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps or CR Modifiers for Magic Traps) to the base CR for the trap type.

@strong{Mechanical Trap}: The base CR for a mechanical trap is 0. If your final CR is 0 or lower, add features until you get a CR of 1 or higher.

@strong{Magic Trap}: For a spell trap or magic device trap, the base CR is 1. The highest-level spell used modifies the CR (see CR Modifiers for Magic Traps).

@strong{Average Damage}: If a trap (mechanical or magical) does hit point damage, calculate the average damage for a successful hit and round that value to the nearest multiple of 10. If the trap is designed to hit more than one target, multiply this value by 2. If the trap is designed to deal damage over a number of rounds, multiply this value by the number of rounds the trap will be active (or the average number of rounds, if the duration is variable). Use this value to adjust the Challenge Rating of the trap, as indicated on Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps. Damage from poison does not count toward this value, but extra damage from pit spikes and multiple attacks does.

For a magic trap, only one modifier applies to the CR---either the level of the highest-level spell used in the trap, or the average damage figure, whichever is larger.

@strong{Multiple Traps}: If a trap is really two or more connected traps that affect approximately the same area, determine the CR of each one separately.

@emph{Multiple Dependent Traps}: If one trap depends on the success of the other (that is, you can avoid the second trap by not falling victim to the first), characters earn XP for both traps by defeating the first one, regardless if the second one is also sprung.

@emph{Multiple Independent Traps}: If two or more traps act independently (they do not depend on one another to activate), characters only earn XP for traps that they defeat.

@node Mechanical Trap Cost
@subsection Mechanical Trap Cost
@anchor{#mechanical-trap-cost}
The cost of a mechanical trap is 1,000 gp × the trap's Challenge Rating. If the trap uses spells in its trigger or reset, add those costs separately. If the trap cannot be reset, divide the cost in half. If the trap has an automatic reset, increase the cost by half (+50%). Particularly simple traps, such as pit traps, might have a greatly reduced cost, subject to GM discretion. Such traps might cost as little as 250 gp × the trap's Challenge Rating.

After you've determined the cost by Challenge Rating, add the price of any alchemical items or poison you incorporated into the trap. If the trap uses one of these elements and has an automatic reset, multiply the poison or alchemical item cost by 20 to provide an adequate supply of doses.

@strong{Multiple Traps}: If a trap is really two or more connected traps, determine the final cost of each separately, then add those values together. This holds for both multiple dependent and multiple independent traps.

@node Magic Device Trap Cost
@subsection Magic Device Trap Cost
@anchor{#magic-device-trap-cost}
Building a magic device trap involves the expenditure of gp and requires the services of a spellcaster. Table: Cost Modifiers for Magic Device Traps summarizes the cost information for magic device traps. If the trap uses more than one spell (for instance, a sound or visual trigger spell in addition to the main spell effect), the builder must pay for them all (except @emph{alarm}, which is free unless it must be cast by an NPC).

The costs derived from Table: Cost Modifiers for Magic Device Traps assume that the builder is casting the necessary spells himself (or perhaps some other PC is providing the spells for free). If an NPC spellcaster must be hired to cast them, those costs must be factored in as well (see [Equipment]).

A magic device trap takes 1 day to construct per 500 gp of its cost.

@node Spell Trap Cost
@subsection Spell Trap Cost
@anchor{#spell-trap-cost}
A spell trap has a cost only if the builder must hire an NPC spellcaster to cast it.

@subsection Craft DCs for Mechanical Traps
@anchor{#craft-dcs-for-mechanical-traps}
Once you know the Challenge Rating of a trap, determine the Craft (traps) DC by referring to the values and modifiers given on Table: Craft (Traps) DCs.

@strong{Making the Checks}: To determine how much progress a character makes on building a trap each week, that character makes a Craft (traps) check. See the Craft skill description for details on Craft checks and the circumstances that can affect them.

@node Getting Lost
@section Getting Lost
@anchor{#getting-lost}
There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or shoreline prevents most from becoming lost, but travelers striking off cross-country might become disoriented---especially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

@strong{Poor Visibility}: Anytime characters cannot see at least 60 feet due to reduced visibility conditions, they might become lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters traveling at night might be at risk, too, depending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether they have darkvision or low-light vision.

@strong{Difficult Terrain}: Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain might become lost if he moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track. Forests are especially dangerous because they obscure far-off landmarks and make it hard to see the sun or stars.

@strong{Chance to Get Lost}: If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed on a Survival check or become lost. The difficulty of this check varies based on the terrain, the visibility conditions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area being traveled through. Refer to the table below and use the highest DC that applies.

A character with at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (geography) or Knowledge (local) pertaining to the area being traveled through gains a +2 bonus on this check.

Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or overland movement to see if travelers have become lost. In the case of a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the check.

@strong{Effects of Being Lost}: If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel. Randomly determine the direction in which the party actually travels during each hour of local or overland movement. The characters' movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark they can't miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.

@emph{Recognizing You're Lost}: Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt a Survival check (DC 20, --1 per hour of random travel) to recognize that he is no longer certain of his direction of travel. Some circumstances might make it obvious that the characters are lost.

@emph{Setting a New Course}: Determining the correct direction of travel once a party has become lost requires a Survival check (DC 15, +2 per hour of random travel). If a character fails this check, he chooses a random direction as the “correct” direction for resuming travel.

Once the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, they might get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of travel as described above to see if the party maintains its new course or begins to move at random again.

@emph{Conflicting Directions}: It's possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. Make a Survival check for each character in secret, then tell the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction in which to travel, and tell the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is right, with no indication who is correct.

@strong{Regaining Your Bearings}: There are several ways for characters to find their way after becoming lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination they're trying to reach, they're not lost anymore. Second, the characters, through random movement, might run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve---the fog lifts or the sun comes up---lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Survival check.

@node Forest Terrain
@section Forest Terrain
@anchor{#forest-terrain}
Forest terrain can be divided into three categories: sparse, medium, and dense. An immense forest could have all three categories within its borders, with more sparse terrain at the outer edge of the forest and dense forest at its heart.

The table below describes in general terms how likely it is that a given square has a terrain element in it.

Category of Forest

@strong{Trees}: The most important terrain element in a forest is the trees, obviously. A creature standing in the same square as a tree gains partial cover, which grants a +2 bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} and a +1 bonus on [Reflex] saves. The presence of a tree doesn't otherwise affect a creature's fighting space, because it's assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has [AC] 4, hardness 5, and 150 hp. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They have [AC] 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them.

@strong{Undergrowth}: Vines, roots, and short bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into, and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren't mutually exclusive; it's common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.

@strong{Forest Canopy}: It's common for elves and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor. These wooden platforms often have rope bridges between them. To get to the treehouses, characters ascend the trees' branches (Climb DC 15), use rope ladders (Climb DC 0), or take pulley elevators (which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a Strength check, made each round as a full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches in a forest canopy are considered to have cover when fighting creatures on the ground, and in medium or dense forests they have concealment as well.

@strong{Other Forest Terrain Elements}: Fallen logs generally stand about 3 feet high and provide cover just as low walls do. They cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest streams average 5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways wind through most forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither cover nor concealment. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even unexplored forests have occasional game trails.

@strong{Stealth and Detection in a Forest}: In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 3d6 × 10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8 × 10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6 × 10 feet.

Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it's usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.

The background noise in the forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, increasing the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1.

* Forest Fires CR 6::
@end menu

@node Forest Fires CR 6
@subsection Forest Fires (CR 6)
@anchor{#forest-fires-cr-6}
Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees ablaze and start forest fires in this way. Whatever the cause of the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.

A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6 × 100 feet by a character who makes a Perception check, treating the fire as a Colossal creature (reducing the DC by 16). If all characters fail their Perception checks, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance. With proper elevation, the smoke from a forest fire can be spotted as far as 10 miles away.

Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Perception checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus automatically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.

The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it remains so for 2d4 × 10 minutes before [dying] to a smoking wasteland. Characters overtaken by a forest fire might find the leading edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up, trapping them deeper and deeper within its grasp.

Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

@strong{Heat Damage}: Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see @ref{#heat-dangers,Heat Dangers}). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of fire damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a [Fortitude] save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a --4 penalty on their saving throws. Those wearing metal armor or who come into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a @emph{heat metal}spell.

@strong{Catching on Fire}: Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of [catching on fire] when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and continue to be at risk once per minute thereafter.

@strong{Smoke Inhalation}: Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a [Fortitude] save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Smoke also provides concealment to characters within it.

@node Marsh Terrain
@section Marsh Terrain
@anchor{#marsh-terrain}
Two categories of marsh exist: relatively dry moors and watery swamps. Both are often bordered by lakes (described in Aquatic Terrain), which are effectively a third category of terrain found in marshes.

@strong{Bogs}: If a square is part of a shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1 foot in depth. It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a shallow bog, and the DC of Acrobatics checks in such a square increases by 2.

A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It costs Medium or larger creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.

The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to [AC], +4 bonus on [Reflex] saves). Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a --10 penalty on attacks against creatures that aren't underwater.

Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares.

Both shallow and deep bogs increase the DC of Stealth checks by 2.

@strong{Undergrowth}: The bushes, rushes, and other tall grasses in marshes function as undergrowth does in a forest. A square that is part of a bog does not also have undergrowth.

@strong{Quicksand}: Patches of quicksand present a deceptively solid appearance (appearing as undergrowth or open land) that might trap careless characters. A character approaching a patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a DC 8 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don't have a chance to detect a hidden patch before blundering into it. A typical patch of quicksand is 20 feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him 1d2 × 5 feet into the quicksand.

@emph{Effects of Quicksand}: Characters in quicksand must make a DC 10 Swim check every round to simply tread water in place, or a DC 15 Swim check to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath (see the Swim skill description in [Using Skills])@emph{.}

Characters below the surface of quicksand may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15, +1 per consecutive round of being under the surface).

@emph{Rescue}: Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one end of it. Then he must make a DC 15 Strength check to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a DC 10 Strength check to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make a DC 15 Swim check immediately to stay above the surface.

@strong{Hedgerows}: Common in moors, hedgerows are tangles of stones, soil, and thorny bushes. Narrow hedgerows function as low walls, and it takes 3 squares of movement to cross them. Wide hedgerows are more than 5 feet tall and take up entire squares. They provide total cover, just as a wall does. It takes 4 squares of movement to move through a square with a wide hedgerow; creatures that succeed on a DC 10 Climb check need only 2 squares of movement to move through the square.

@strong{Other Marsh Terrain Elements}: Some marshes, particularly swamps, have trees just as forests do, usually clustered in small stands. Paths lead across many marshes, winding to avoid bog areas. As in forests, paths allow normal movement and don't provide the concealment that undergrowth does.

@strong{Stealth and Detection in a Marsh}: In a marsh, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 × 10 feet. In a swamp, this distance is 2d8 × 10 feet.

Undergrowth and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment, so it's easy to use Stealth in a marsh.

@node Hills Terrain
@section Hills Terrain
@anchor{#hills-terrain}
A hill can exist in most other types of terrain, but hills can also dominate the landscape. Hills terrain is divided into two categories: gentle hills and rugged hills. Hills terrain often serves as a transition zone between rugged terrain such as mountains and flat terrain such as plains.

15%

@strong{Gradual Slope}: This incline isn't steep enough to affect movement, but characters gain a +1 bonus on melee attacks against foes downhill from them.

@strong{Steep Slope}: Characters moving uphill (to an adjacent square of higher elevation) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter each square of steep slope. Characters running or charging downhill (moving to an adjacent square of lower elevation) must succeed on a DC 10 Acrobatics check upon entering the first steep slope square. Mounted characters make a DC 10 Ride check instead. Characters who fail this check stumble and must end their movement 1d2 × 5 feet later. Characters who fail by 5 or more fall [prone] in the square where they end their movement. A steep slope increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 2.

@strong{Cliff}: A cliff typically requires a DC 15 Climb check to scale and is 1d4 × 10 feet tall, although the needs of your map might mandate a taller cliff. A cliff isn't perfectly vertical, taking up 5-foot squares if it's less than 30 feet tall and 10-foot squares if it's 30 feet or taller.

@strong{Light Undergrowth}: Sagebrush and other scrubby bushes grow on hills, although they rarely cover the landscape. Light undergrowth provides concealment and increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2.

@strong{Other Hills Terrain Elements}: Trees aren't out of place in hills terrain, and valleys often have active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) or dry streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across) in them. If you add a stream or streambed, remember that water always flows downhill.

@strong{Stealth and Detection in Hills}: In gentle hills, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 2d10 × 10 feet. In rugged hills, this distance is 2d6 × 10 feet.

Hiding in hills terrain can be difficult if there isn't undergrowth around. A hilltop or ridge provides enough cover to hide from anyone below the hilltop or ridge.

@node Mountain Terrain
@section Mountain Terrain
@anchor{#mountain-terrain}
The three mountain terrain categories are alpine meadows, rugged mountains, and forbidding mountains. As characters ascend into a mountainous area, they're likely to face each terrain category in turn, beginning with alpine meadows, extending through rugged mountains, and reaching forbidding mountains near the summit.

Mountains have an important terrain element, the rock wall, that is marked on the border between squares rather than taking up squares itself.

@strong{Gradual and Steep Slopes}: These function as described in Hills Terrain.

@strong{Cliff}: These terrain elements also function like their hills terrain counterparts, but they're typically 2d6 × 10 feet tall. Cliffs taller than 80 feet take up 20 feet of horizontal space.

@strong{Chasm}: Usually formed by natural geological processes, chasms function like pits in a dungeon setting. Chasms aren't hidden, so characters won't fall into them by accident (although bull rushes are another story). A typical chasm is 2d4 × 10 feet deep, at least 20 feet long, and anywhere from 5 feet to 20 feet wide. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb out of a chasm. In forbidding mountain terrain, chasms are typically 2d8 × 10 feet deep.

@strong{Light Undergrowth}: This functions as described in Forest Terrain.

@strong{Scree}: A field of shifting gravel, scree doesn't affect speed, but it can be treacherous on a slope. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 2 if there's scree on a gradual slope and by 5 if there's scree on a steep slope. The DC of Stealth checks increases by 2 if the scree is on a slope of any kind.

@strong{Dense Rubble}: The ground is covered with rocks of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Acrobatics checks on dense rubble increases by 5, and the DC of Stealth checks increases by 2.

@strong{Rock Wall}: A vertical plane of stone, rock walls require DC 25 Climb checks to ascend. A typical rock wall is 2d4 × 10 feet tall in rugged mountains and 2d8 × 10 feet tall in forbidding mountains. Rock walls are drawn on the edges of squares, not in the squares themselves.

@strong{Cave Entrance}: Found in cliff and steep slope squares and next to rock walls, cave entrances are typically between 5 and 20 feet wide and 5 feet deep. A cave could be anything from a simple chamber to the entrance to an elaborate dungeon. Caves used as monster lairs typically have 1d3 rooms that are 1d4 × 10 feet across.

@strong{Other Mountain Terrain Features}: Most alpine meadows begin above the treeline, so trees and other forest elements are rare in the mountains. Mountain terrain can include active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) and dry streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across). Particularly high-altitude areas tend to be colder than the lowland areas that surround them, so they might be covered in ice sheets (described in Desert Terrain).

@strong{Stealth and Detection in Mountains}: As a guideline, the maximum distance in mountain terrain at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 4d10 × 10 feet. Certain peaks and ridgelines afford much better vantage points, of course, and twisting valleys and canyons have much shorter spotting distances. Because there's little vegetation to obstruct line of sight, the specifics on your map are your best guide for the range at which an encounter could begin. As in hills terrain, a ridge or peak provides enough cover to hide from anyone below the high point.

It's easier to hear faraway sounds in the mountains. The DC of Perception checks that rely on sound increase by 1 per 20 feet between listener and source, not per 10 feet.

* Avalanches CR 7::
* Mountain Travel::
@end menu

@node Avalanches CR 7
@subsection Avalanches (CR 7)
@anchor{#avalanches-cr-7}
The combination of high peaks and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many mountainous areas. While avalanches of snow and ice are common, it's also possible to have an avalanche of rock and soil.

An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10 × 500 feet by a character who makes a DC 20 Perception check, treating the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their Perception checks to determine the encounter distance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance. It's possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can't see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15 Perception check can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6 × 500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the bury zone (in the direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone (the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone always take damage from the avalanche; characters in the slide zone might be able to get out of the way. Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 [Reflex] save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage if they make a DC 15 [Reflex] save. Those who fail their saves are buried.

Buried characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a buried character falls [unconscious], he must make a DC 15 [Constitution] check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead. See Cave-Ins and Collapses for rules on digging out buried creatures.

The typical avalanche has a width of 1d6 × 100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the opposite edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche's full width.

To determine the precise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6 × 20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party's location. Avalanches of snow and ice advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, while rock and soil avalanches travel at a speed of 250 feet per round.

@node Mountain Travel
@subsection Mountain Travel
@anchor{#mountain-travel}
High altitude travel can be extremely fatiguing---and sometimes deadly---to creatures that aren't used to it. Cold becomes extreme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of warriors.

@strong{Acclimated Characters}: Creatures accustomed to high altitude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature with an Environment entry that includes mountains is considered native to the area and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters can also acclimate themselves by living at high altitude for a month. Characters who spend more than two months away from the mountains must reacclimate themselves when they return. Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune to altitude effects.

@strong{Altitude Zones}: In general, mountains present three possible altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.

@emph{Low Pass (lower than 5,000 feet)}: Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes, a zone consisting largely of alpine meadows and forests. Travelers might find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modifiers for traveling through mountains), but the altitude itself has no game effect.

@emph{Low Peak or High Pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet)}: Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this category. All non-acclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at this altitude. Characters must succeed on a [Fortitude] save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or be [fatigued]. The fatigue ends when the character descends to an altitude with more air. Acclimated characters do not have to attempt the [Fortitude] save.

@emph{High Peak (more than 15,000 feet)}: The highest mountains exceed 15,000 feet in height. At these elevations, creatures are subject to both high altitude fatigue (as described above) and altitude sickness, whether or not they're acclimated to high altitudes@emph{.}Altitude sickness represents long-term oxygen deprivation, and affects mental and physical ability scores. After each 6-hour period a character spends at an altitude of over 15,000 feet, he must succeed on a [Fortitude] save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point of damage to all ability scores. Creatures acclimated to high altitude receive a +4 competence bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned mountaineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.

@node Desert Terrain
@section Desert Terrain
@anchor{#desert-terrain}
Desert terrain exists in warm, temperate, and cold climates, but all deserts share one common trait: little rain. The three categories of desert terrain are tundra (cold desert), rocky deserts (often temperate), and sandy deserts (often warm).

Tundra differs from the other desert categories in two important ways. Because snow and ice cover much of the landscape, it's easy to find water. During the height of summer, the permafrost thaws to a depth of a foot or so, turning the landscape into a vast field of mud. The muddy tundra affects movement and skill use as the shallow bogs described in Marsh Terrain, although there's little standing water.

The table below describes terrain elements found in each of the three desert categories. The terrain elements on this table are mutually exclusive; for instance, a square of tundra might contain either light undergrowth or an ice sheet, but not both.

@strong{Light Undergrowth}: Consisting of scrubby, hardy bushes and cacti, light undergrowth functions as described for other terrain types.

@strong{Ice Sheet}: The ground is covered with slippery ice. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by an ice sheet, and the DC of Acrobatics checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across an ice sheet.

@strong{Light Rubble}: Small rocks are strewn across the ground, making nimble movement more difficult. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 2.

@strong{Dense Rubble}: This terrain feature consists of more and larger stones. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 5, and the DC of Stealth checks increases by 2.

@strong{Sand Dunes}: Created by the action of wind on sand, dunes function as hills that move. If the wind is strong and consistent, a sand dune can move several hundred feet in a week's time. Sand dunes can cover hundreds of squares. They always have a gentle slope pointing in the direction of the prevailing wind and a steep slope on the leeward side.

@strong{Other Desert Terrain Features}: Tundra is sometimes bordered by forests, and the occasional tree isn't out of place in the cold wastes. Rocky deserts have towers and mesas consisting of flat ground surrounded on all sides by cliffs and steep slopes (as described in Mountain Terrain). Sandy deserts sometimes have quicksand; this functions as described in Marsh Terrain, although desert quicksand is a waterless mixture of fine sand and dust. All desert terrain is crisscrossed with dry streambeds (treat as trenches 5 to 15 feet wide) that fill with water on the rare occasions when rain falls.

@strong{Stealth and Detection in the Desert}: In general, the maximum distance in desert terrain at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 × 20 feet; beyond this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm deserts makes sight-based Perception impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts limits spotting distance to 6d6 × 10 feet. The scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer concealment or cover makes using Stealth more difficult.

@subsection Sandstorms
@anchor{#sandstorms}
A sandstorm reduces visibility to 1d10 × 5 feet and provides a --4 penalty on Perception checks. A sandstorm deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per hour to any creatures caught in the open, and leaves a thin coating of sand in its wake. Driving sand creeps in through all but the most secure seals and seams, chafing skin and contaminating carried gear.

@node Plains Terrain
@section Plains Terrain
@anchor{#plains-terrain}
Plains come in three categories: farms, grasslands, and battlefields. Farms are common in settled areas, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The battlefields where large armies clash are temporary places, usually reclaimed by natural vegetation or the farmer's plow. Battlefields represent a third terrain category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there, not because they're particularly prevalent.

The table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in the different categories of plains. On a farm, light undergrowth represents most mature grain crops, so farms growing vegetable crops will have less light undergrowth, as will all farms during the time between harvest and a few months after planting.

The terrain elements in the table below are mutually exclusive.

@strong{Undergrowth}: Whether they're crops or natural vegetation, the tall grasses of the plains function like light undergrowth in a forest. Particularly thick bushes form patches of heavy undergrowth that dot the landscape in grasslands.

@strong{Light Rubble}: On the battlefield, light rubble usually represents something that was destroyed: the ruins of a building or the scattered remnants of a stone wall, for example. It functions as described in the Desert Terrain section.

@strong{Trench}: Often dug before a battle to protect soldiers, a trench functions as a low wall, except that it provides no cover against adjacent foes. It costs 2 squares of movement to leave a trench, but it costs nothing extra to enter one. Creatures outside a trench who make a melee attack against a creature inside the trench gain a +1 bonus on melee attacks because they have higher ground. In farm terrain, trenches are generally irrigation ditches.

@strong{Berm}: A common defensive structure, a berm is a low, earthen wall that slows movement and provides a measure of cover. Put a berm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows of steep slope (described in Hills Terrain), with the edges of the berm on the downhill side. Thus, a character crossing a 2-square berm will travel uphill for 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide cover as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms provide the low wall benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from the top of the berm.

@strong{Fences}: Wooden fences are generally used to contain livestock or impede oncoming soldiers. It costs an extra square of movement to cross a wooden fence. A stone fence provides a measure of cover as well, functioning as low walls. Mounted characters can cross a fence without slowing their movement if they succeed on a DC 15 Ride check. If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider falls out of the saddle.

@strong{Other Plains Terrain Features}: Occasional trees dot the landscape in many plains, although on battlefields they're often felled to provide raw material for siege engines (described in Urban Features). Hedgerows (described in Marsh Terrain) are found in plains as well. Streams, generally 5 to 20 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet deep, are commonplace.

@strong{Stealth and Detection in Plains}: In plains terrain, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 × 40 feet, although the specifics of your map might restrict line of sight. Cover and concealment are not uncommon, so a good place of refuge is often nearby, if not right at hand.

@node Aquatic Terrain
@section Aquatic Terrain
@anchor{#aquatic-terrain}
Aquatic terrain is the least hospitable to most PCs, because they can't breathe there. Aquatic terrain doesn't offer the variety that land terrain does. The ocean floor holds many marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the terrain elements described earlier in this section, but if characters find themselves in the water because they were bull rushed off the deck of a pirate ship, the tall kelp beds hundreds of feet below them don't matter. Accordingly, these rules simply divide aquatic terrain into two categories: flowing water (such as streams and rivers) and non-flowing water (such as lakes and oceans).

@strong{Flowing Water}: Large, placid rivers move at only a few miles per hour, so they function as still water for most purposes. But some rivers and streams are swifter; anything floating in them moves downstream at a speed of 10 to 40 feet per round. The fastest rapids send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to 90 feet per round. Fast rivers are always at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and whitewater rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20). If a character is in moving water, move her downstream the indicated distance at the end of her turn. A character trying to maintain her position relative to the riverbank can spend some or all of her turn swimming upstream.

@emph{Swept Away}: Characters swept away by a river moving 60 feet per round or faster must make DC 20 Swim checks every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, she arrests her motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag---she is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping the rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC 20 Swim checks in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can't escape under their own power unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear. Other characters can rescue them as if they were trapped in quicksand (described in Marsh Terrain).

@strong{Non-Flowing Water}: Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Swim checks to move through (DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water). Characters need a way to breathe if they're underwater; failing that, they risk drowning. When underwater, characters can move in any direction.

@strong{Stealth and Detection Underwater}: How far you can see underwater depends on the water's clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8 × 10 feet if the water is clear, and 1d8 × 10 feet if it's murky. Moving water is always murky, unless it's in a particularly large, slow-moving river.

It's hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the sea floor).

@emph{Invisibility}: An [invisible] creature displaces water and leaves a visible, body-shaped “bubble” where the water was displaced. The creature still has concealment (20% miss chance), but not total concealment (50% miss chance).

@subsection Underwater Combat
@anchor{#underwater-combat}
Land-based creatures can have considerable difficulty when fighting in water. Water affects a creature's attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases a creature's opponents might get a bonus on attacks. The effects are summarized on Table: Combat Adjustments Underwater. They apply whenever a character is swimming, walking in chest-deep water, or walking along the bottom of a body of water.

1 Creatures flailing about in the water (usually because they failed their Swim checks) have a hard time fighting effectively. An off-balance creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on attacks against it.

2 A creature without @emph{freedom of movement}effects or a swim speed makes grapple checks underwater at a --2 penalty, but deals damage normally when grappling.

3 A successful Swim check lets a creature move one-quarter its speed as a move action or one-half its speed as a full-round action.

4 Creatures have firm footing when walking along the bottom, braced against a ship's hull, or the like. A creature can only walk along the bottom if it wears or carries enough gear to weigh itself down: at least 16 pounds for Medium creatures, twice that for each size category larger than Medium, and half that for each size category smaller than Medium.

@strong{Ranged Attacks Underwater}: Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Attacks with other ranged weapons take a --2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for range.

@strong{Attacks from Land}: Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep, have improved cover , +4 bonus on [Reflex] saves) from opponents on land. Land-bound opponents who have @emph{freedom of movement}effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have @emph{freedom of movement}effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.

@strong{Fire}: Nonmagical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is ineffective underwater unless its description states otherwise. The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made the caster level check to make the fire spell usable underwater, the surface still blocks the spell's line of effect.

@strong{Spellcasting Underwater}: Casting spells while submerged can be difficult for those who cannot breathe underwater. A creature that cannot breathe water must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell underwater (this is in addition to the caster level check to successfully cast a fire spell underwater). Creatures that can breathe water are unaffected and can cast spells normally. Some spells might function differently underwater, subject to GM discretion.

@node Floods
@subsection Floods
@anchor{#floods}
In many wilderness areas, river floods are a common occurrence.

In spring, an enormous snowmelt can engorge the streams and rivers it feeds. Other catastrophic events such as massive rainstorms or the destruction of a dam can create floods as well.

During a flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4 × 50%. Fords might disappear for days, bridges might be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river. A river in flood makes Swim checks one category harder (calm water becomes rough, and rough water becomes stormy). Rivers also become 50% swifter.

@node Urban Adventures
@chapter Urban Adventures
@anchor{#urban-adventures}
At first glance, a city is much like a dungeon, made up of walls, doors, rooms, and corridors. Adventures that take place in cities have two salient differences from their dungeon counterparts, however. Characters have greater access to resources, and they must contend with law enforcement.

@strong{Access to Resources}: Unlike in dungeons and the wilderness, characters can buy and sell gear quickly in a city. A large city or metropolis probably has high-level NPCs and experts in obscure fields of knowledge who can provide assistance and decipher clues. And when the PCs are battered and bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a room at an inn.

The freedom to retreat and ready access to the marketplace means that the players have a greater degree of control over the pacing of an urban adventure.

@strong{Law Enforcement}: The other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving into a dungeon is that a dungeon is, almost by definition, a lawless place where the only law is that of the jungle: kill or be killed. A city, on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to prevent the sort of killing and looting that adventurers engage in all the time. Even so, most cities' laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to monsters such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the law); only evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.

Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting spellcasters.

The city's laws might not affect all characters equally. A monk isn't hampered at all by a law about peace-bonding weapons, but a cleric is reduced to a fraction of his power if all holy symbols are confiscated at the city's gates.

@node Walls and Gates
@subsection Walls and Gates
@anchor{#walls-and-gates}
Many cities are surrounded by walls. A typical small city wall is a fortified stone wall 5 feet thick and 20 feet high. Such a wall is fairly smooth, requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. The walls are crenellated on one side to provide a low wall for the guards atop it, and there is just barely room for guards to walk along the top of the wall. A typical small city wall has [AC] 3, hardness 8, and 450 hp per 10-foot section.

A typical large city wall is 10 feet thick and 30 feet high, with crenellations on both sides for the guards on top of the wall. It is likewise smooth, requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. Such a wall has [AC] 3, hardness 8, and 720 hp per 10-foot section.

A typical metropolis wall is 15 feet thick and 40 feet tall. It has crenellations on both sides and often has a tunnel and small rooms running through its interior. Metropolis walls have [AC] 3, hardness 8, and 1,170 hp per 10-foot section.

Unlike smaller cities, metropolises often have interior walls as well as surrounding walls---either old walls that the city has outgrown, or walls dividing individual districts from each other. Sometimes these walls are as large and thick as the outer walls, but more often they have the characteristics of a large city's or small city's walls.

@strong{Watchtowers}: Some city walls are adorned with watchtowers set at irregular intervals. Few cities have enough guards to keep someone constantly stationed at every tower, unless the city is expecting attack from outside. The towers provide a superior view of the surrounding countryside as well as a point of defense against invaders.

Watchtowers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and their diameter is 5 times the thickness of the wall. Arrow slits line the outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is crenellated like the surrounding walls are. In a small tower (25 feet in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick wall), a simple ladder typically connects the tower's stories and its roof. In a larger tower, stairs serve that purpose.

Heavy wooden doors, reinforced with iron and bearing good locks (Disable Device DC 30), block entry to a tower, unless the tower is in regular use. As a rule, the captain of the guard keeps the keys to the towers secured on her person, and second copies are in the city's inner fortress or barracks.

@strong{Gates}: A typical city gate is a gatehouse with two portcullises and murder holes above the space between them. In towns and some small cities, the primary entry is through iron double doors set into the city wall.

Gates are usually open during the day and locked or barred at night. Usually, one gate lets in travelers after sunset and is staffed by guards who will open it for someone who seems honest, presents proper papers, or offers a large enough bribe (depending on the city and the guards).

@node Guards and Soldiers
@subsection Guards and Soldiers
@anchor{#guards-and-soldiers}
A city typically has full-time military personnel equal to 1% of its adult population, in addition to militia or conscript soldiers equal to 5% of the population. The full-time soldiers are city guards responsible for maintaining order within the city, similar to the role of modern police, and (to a lesser extent) for defending the city from outside assault. Conscript soldiers are called up to serve in case of an attack on the city.

A typical city guard force works on three 8-hour shifts, with 30% of the force on a day shift (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.), 35% on an evening shift (4 p.m. to 12 a.m.), and 35% on a night shift (12 a.m. to 8 a.m.). At any given time, 80% of the guards on duty are on the streets patrolling, while the remaining 20% are stationed at various posts throughout the city where they can respond to nearby alarms. At least one such guard post is present within each neighborhood of a city (each neighborhood consisting of several districts).

The majority of a city guard force is made up of warriors, mostly 1st level. Officers include higher-level warriors, fighters, a fair number of clerics, and wizards or sorcerers, as well as multiclass fighter/spellcasters.

Siege engines are treated as difficult devices if someone tries to disable them using Disable Device. This takes 2d4 rounds and requires a DC 20 Disable Device check. Siege engines are typically made out of wood and have an [AC] of 3 (--5 [Dex], --2 size), a Hardness of 5, and 80 hit points. Siege engines made up of a different material might have different values. Some siege engines are armored as well. Treat the siege engine as a Huge creature to determine the cost of such armor. Siege engines can be crafted as masterwork and enchanted as magic weapons, adding bonuses on attack rolls to the checks made to hit with the siege engine. A masterwork siege engine costs 300 gp more than the listed price. Enchanting a siege engine costs twice the normal amount. For example, a @emph{+1 flaming heavy catapult}, armored with full plate, would have an [AC] of 11 and would cost 23,100 gp (800 gp base + 6,000 gp for the armor + 300 gp masterwork + 16,000 gp for the enhancements).

@strong{Catapult, Heavy}: A heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy objects with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a high arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base attack bonus, [Intelligence] modifier, range increment penalty, and the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of Table: Siege Engines. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 [Reflex] save take half damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes direction or speed.

If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Finally, count 1d4 squares away from the target square for every range increment of the attack.

Loading a catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15 Strength check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to two crew members to use the aid another action, assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check latches the arm into place, and then another DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four full-round actions to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions in the same round, so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).

A heavy catapult takes up a space 15 feet across.

@strong{Catapult, Light}: This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions as the heavy catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to winch the arm into place, and only two full-round actions are required to reaim the catapult.

A light catapult takes up a space 10 feet across.

@strong{Ballista}: A ballista is essentially a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its size makes it hard for most creatures to aim it@emph{.}Thus, a Medium creature takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls when using a ballista, and a Small creature takes a --6 penalty. It takes a creature smaller than Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after firing.

A ballista takes up a space 5 feet across.

@strong{Ram}: This heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the crew to swing it back and forth against objects. As a full-round action, the character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the [AC] of the construction, applying the --4 penalty for lack of proficiency. It's not possible to be proficient with this device. In addition to the damage given on Table: Siege Engines, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their Strength modifiers to the ram's damage, if they devote an attack action to doing so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small creatures to swing a ram.

A ram is typically 30 feet long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between them.

@strong{Siege Tower}: This device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus get to the top of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually 1 foot thick.

A typical siege tower takes up a space 15 feet across. The creatures inside push it at a base land speed of 10 feet (and a siege tower can't run). The eight creatures pushing on the ground floor have total cover, and those on higher floors get improved cover and can fire through arrow slits.

@node City Streets
@subsection City Streets
@anchor{#city-streets}
Typical city streets are narrow and twisting. Most streets average 15 to 20 feet wide, while alleys range from 10 feet wide to only 5 feet. Cobblestones in good condition allow normal movement, but roads in poor repair and heavily rutted dirt streets are considered light rubble, increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks by 2.

Some cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew from small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities to construct new roads through formerly inhabited areas, might have a few larger streets through town. These main roads are 25 feet wide---offering room for wagons to pass each other---with 5-foot-wide sidewalks on either side.

@strong{Crowds}: Urban streets are often full of people going about their daily lives. In most cases, it isn't necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on the map when a fight breaks out on the city's main thoroughfare. Instead, just indicate which squares on the map contain crowds. If crowds see something obviously dangerous, they'll move away at 30 feet per round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who does so, enabling a Stealth check and providing a bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} and on [Reflex] saves.

@emph{Directing Crowds}: It takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 Intimidate check to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to hear or see the character making the attempt. It takes a full-round action to make the Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the Intimidate check.

If two or more characters are trying to direct a crowd in different directions, they make opposed Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to determine to whom the crowd listens. The crowd ignores everyone if none of the characters' check results beat the DCs given above.

@node Above and Beneath the Streets
@subsection Above and Beneath the Streets
@anchor{#above-and-beneath-the-streets}
@strong{Rooftops}: Getting to a roof usually requires climbing a [wall], unless the character can reach a roof by jumping down from a higher window, balcony, or bridge. Flat roofs, common only in warm climates (as accumulated snow can cause a flat roof to collapse), are easy to run across. Moving along the peak of a pitched roof requires a DC 20 Acrobatics check. Moving on an angled roof surface without changing altitude (moving parallel to the peak, in other words) requires a DC 15 Acrobatics check. Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check.

Eventually a character runs out of roof, requiring a long jump across to the next roof or down to the ground. The distance to the closest roof is usually 1d3 × 5 feet horizontally, but the next roof is equally likely to be 5 feet higher, 5 feet lower, or the same height. Use the guidelines in the Acrobatics skill (a horizontal jump's peak height is one-fourth of the horizontal distance) to determine whether a character can make a jump.

@strong{Sewers}: To get into the sewers, most characters open a grate (a full-round action) and jump down 10 feet. Sewers are built exactly like dungeons, except that they're much more likely to have floors that are slippery or covered with water. Sewers are also similar to dungeons in terms of creatures liable to be encountered therein. Some cities were built atop the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes lead to treasures and dangers from a bygone age.

@node City Buildings
@subsection City Buildings
@anchor{#city-buildings}
Most city buildings fall into three categories. The majority of buildings in the city are two to five stories high, built side-by-side to form long rows separated by secondary or main streets. These row houses usually have businesses on the ground floor, with offices or apartments above.

Inns, successful businesses, and large warehouses---as well as millers, tanners, and other businesses that require extra space---are generally large, free-standing buildings with up to five stories.

Finally, small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds are simple, one-story wooden buildings, especially if they're in poorer neighborhoods.

Most city buildings are made of a combination of stone or clay brick (on the lower one or two stories) and timbers (for the upper stories, interior walls, and floors). Roofs are a mixture of boards, thatch, and slates, sealed with pitch. A typical lower-story wall is 1 foot thick, with [AC] 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a Climb DC of 25. Upper-story walls are 6 inches thick, with [AC] 3, hardness 5, 60 hp, and a Climb DC of 21. Exterior doors on most buildings are good wooden doors that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as shops and taverns.

@node City Lights
@subsection City Lights
@anchor{#city-lights}
If a city has main thoroughfares, they are lined with lanterns hanging at a height of 7 feet from building awnings. These lanterns are spaced 60 feet apart, so their illumination is all but continuous. Secondary streets and alleys are not lit; it is common for citizens to hire lantern-bearers when going out after dark.

Alleys can be dark places even in daylight, thanks to the shadows of the tall buildings that surround them. A dark alley in daylight is rarely dark enough to afford true concealment, but it can lend a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.

Table: Random Weather can be used as a simple local weather table. Terms on that table are defined as follows.

@strong{Calm}: Wind speeds are light (0 to 10 mph).

@strong{Cold}: Between 0° and 40° Fahrenheit during the day, 10 to 20 degrees colder at night.

@strong{Cold Snap}: Lowers temperature by --10° F.

@strong{Downpour}: Treat as rain (see Precipitation, below), but conceals as fog. Can create floods. A downpour lasts for 2d4 hours.

@strong{Heat Wave}: Raises temperature by +10° F.

@strong{Hot}: Between 85° and 110° Fahrenheit during the day, 10 to 20 degrees colder at night.

@strong{Moderate}: Between 40° and 60° Fahrenheit during the day, 10 to 20 degrees colder at night.

@strong{Powerful Storm (Windstorm/Blizzard/Hurricane/Tornado)}: Wind speeds are over 50 mph (see Table: Wind Effects). In addition, blizzards are accompanied by heavy snow (1d3 feet), and hurricanes are accompanied by downpours. Windstorms last for 1d6 hours. Blizzards last for 1d3 days. Hurricanes can last for up to a week, but their major impact on characters comes in a 24-to-48-hour period when the center of the storm moves through their area. Tornadoes are very short-lived (1d6 × 10 minutes), typically forming as part of a thunderstorm system.

@strong{Precipitation}: Roll d% to determine whether the precipitation is fog (01--30), rain/snow (31--90), or sleet/hail (91--00). Snow and sleet occur only when the temperature is 30° Fahrenheit or below. Most precipitation lasts for 2d4 hours. By contrast, hail lasts for only 1d20 minutes but usually accompanies 1d4 hours of rain.

@strong{Storm (Duststorm/Snowstorm/Thunderstorm)}: Wind speeds are severe (30 to 50 mph) and visibility is cut by three-quarters. Storms last for 2d4--1 hours. See Storms, below, for more details.

@strong{Warm}: Between 60° and 85° Fahrenheit during the day, 10 to 20 degrees colder at night.

@strong{Windy}: Wind speeds are moderate to strong (10 to 30 mph); see Table: Wind Effects.

@node Rain Snow Sleet and Hail
@subsection Rain, Snow, Sleet, and Hail
@anchor{#rain-snow-sleet-and-hail}
Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another. Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure vision as effectively as a dense fog.

Most precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. Precipitation of any kind followed by a cold snap in which the temperature dips from above freezing to 30° F or below might produce ice.

@emph{Rain}: Rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a --4 penalty on Perception checks. It has the same effect on flames, ranged weapon attacks, and Perception checks as severe wind.

@emph{Snow}: Falling snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and it costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground.

@emph{Heavy Snow}: Heavy snow has the same effects as normal snowfall but also restricts visibility as fog does (see Fog). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4 feet of snow on the ground, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds might result in snowdrifts 1d4 × 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind---a cabin or a large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompanied by lightning (see Thunderstorm). Snow has the same effect on flames as moderate wind.

@emph{Sleet}: Essentially frozen rain, sleet has the same effect as rain while falling (except that its chance to extinguish protected flames is 75%) and the same effect as snow once on the ground.

@emph{Hail}: Hail does not reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes sound-based Perception checks more difficult (--4 penalty). Sometimes (5% chance) hail can become large enough to deal 1 point of lethal damage (per storm) to anything in the open. Once on the ground, hail has the same effect on movement as snow.

@node Storms
@subsection Storms
@anchor{#storms}
The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that accompany all storms reduce visibility ranges by three-quarters, imposing a --8 penalty on Perception checks. Storms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which have a --4 penalty on attack rolls. They automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights. See Table: Wind Effects for possible consequences to creatures caught outside without shelter during such a storm. Storms are divided into the following three types.

@emph{Duststorm (CR 3)}: These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a duststorm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most duststorms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. There is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table: Wind Effects). These greater duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her [Constitution] score). Greater duststorms leave 2d3--1 feet of fine sand in their wake.

@emph{Snowstorm}: In addition to the wind and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.

@emph{Thunderstorm}: In addition to wind and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also hail), thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm. Each bolt causes between 4d8 and 10d8 points of electricity damage. One in 10 thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado.

@strong{Powerful Storms}: Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero, making Perception checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and protected flames have a 75% chance of being doused. Creatures caught in the area must make a [Fortitude] save or face the effects based on the size of the creature (see Table: Wind Effects). Powerful storms are divided into the following four types.

@emph{Windstorm}: While accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through the force of their winds.

@emph{Blizzard}: The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold make blizzards deadly for all who are unprepared for them.

@emph{Hurricane}: In addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity is impossible under such conditions.

@emph{Tornado}: In addition to incredibly high winds, tornadoes can severely injure and kill those that get pulled into their funnels.

@node Fog
@subsection Fog
@anchor{#fog}
Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).

@node Winds
@subsection Winds
@anchor{#winds}
The wind can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, keel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors away. If powerful enough, it can even knock characters down (see Table: Wind Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose penalties on some skill checks.

@emph{2 Checked Size}: Creatures of this size or smaller are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed on a DC 10 Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly skill check if airborne.

@emph{3 Blown Away Size}: Creatures on the ground are knocked prone and rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet, unless they make a DC 15 Strength check. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting, unless they succeed on a DC 25 Fly skill check.

@emph{Light Wind}: A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.

@emph{Moderate Wind}: A steady wind with a 50% chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.

@emph{Strong Wind}: Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose a --2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Perception checks.

@emph{Severe Wind}: In addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50% chance of extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and Perception checks are at a --4 penalty. This is the velocity of wind produced by a @emph{gust of wind}spell.

@emph{Windstorm}: Powerful enough to bring down branches if not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons have a --4 penalty on attack rolls. Perception checks that rely on sound are at a --8 penalty due to the howling of the wind.

@emph{Hurricane-Force Wind}: All flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a --8 penalty on attack rolls). Perception checks based on sound are impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees.

@emph{Tornado (CR 10)}: All flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are sound-based Perception checks. Instead of being blown away (see Table: Wind Effects), characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their [Fortitude] saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage might apply). While a tornado's rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.

@node The Planes
@chapter The Planes
@anchor{#the-planes}
While endless adventure awaits out in the game---there are other worlds beyond these---other continents, other planets, other galaxies. Yet even beyond this existence of countless planets exist more worlds---entirely different dimensions of reality known as the planes of existence. Except for rare linking points that allow travel between them, each plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws. Collectively, the entirety of these other dimensions and planes is known as the Great Beyond.

Although the number of planes is limited only by imagination, they can all be categorized into five general types: the Material Plane, the transitive planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the countless demiplanes.

@strong{Material Plane}: The Material Plane tends to be the most Earth-like of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. The “size” of the Material Plane depends upon the campaign---it might conform only to the single world on which your game is set, or it might encompass an entire universe of planets, moons, stars, and galaxies. The Material Plane is the default plane for the PF Roleplaying Game.

@strong{Transitive Planes}: Transitive planes have one important common characteristic: they “overlap” with other planes, and as such can be used to travel between these overlapping realities. These planes have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and are often accessed by using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well. Example transitive planes include the following.

@emph{Astral Plane}: A silvery void that connects the Material and Inner Planes to the Outer Planes, the astral plane is the medium through which the souls of the departed travel to the afterlife. A traveler in the Astral Plane sees the plane as a vast empty void periodically dotted with tiny motes of physical reality calved off of the countless planes it overlaps. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Astral Plane for a tiny fraction of a second when they teleport, or they can use it to travel between planes with spells like @emph{astral projection}.

@emph{Ethereal Plane}: The Ethereal Plane is a ghostly realm that exists as a buffer between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane, overlapping each. A traveler in the Ethereal plane experiences the real world as if the world were an insubstantial ghost, and can move through solid objects without being seen in the real world. Strange creatures dwell in the Ethereal Plane, as well as ghosts and dreams, many of which can sometimes extend their influence into the real world in mysterious and terrifying ways. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Ethereal Plane with spells like @emph{blink}, @emph{etherealness}, and @emph{ethereal jaunt}.

@emph{Shadow Plane}: The eerie and deadly Shadow Plane is a grim, colorless “duplicate” of the Material Plane. It overlaps with the Material Plane but is smaller in size, and is in many ways a warped and mocking “reflection” of the Material Plane, one infused with negative energy (see Inner Planes) and serving as home for strange monsters like undead shadows and worse. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Shadow Plane to swiftly travel immense distances on the Material Plane with @emph{shadow walk}, or draw upon the mutable essence of the Shadow Plane to create quasi-real effects and creatures with spells like @emph{shadow evocation} or @emph{shades}.

@strong{Inner Planes}: The Inner Planes contain the building blocks of reality---it's easiest to envision these planes as “containing” the Material Plane, but they do not overlap with the Material Plane as do the transitive planes. Each Inner Plane is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the plane itself. Example Inner Planes include the following.

@emph{Elemental Planes}: The four classic Inner Planes are the Plane of Air, the Plane of Earth, the Plane of Fire, and the Plane of Water---it is from these planes that the creatures known as elementals hail, yet they house many other strange denizens as well, such as the genie races, strange metal-eating xorns, unseen invisible stalkers, and mischievous mephits.

@emph{Energy Planes}: Two energy planes exist---the Positive Energy Plane (from which the animating spark of life hails) and the Negative Energy Plane (from which the sinister taint of undeath hails). Energy from both planes infuses reality, the ebb and flow of this energy running through all creatures to bear them along the journey from birth to death. Clerics utilize power from these planes when they channel energy.

@strong{Outer Planes}: Beyond the realm of the mortal world, beyond the building blocks of reality, lie the Outer Planes. Vast beyond imagining, it is to these realms that the souls of the dead travel, and it is upon these realms in which the gods themselves hold court. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment, representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane's alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting place of souls from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes the form of calm introspection or eternal damnation. The denizens of the Outer Planes form the mythologies of civilization, comprising angels and demons, titans and devils, and countless other incarnations of possibility. Each campaign world should have different Outer Planes to match its themes and needs, but classic Outer Planes include lawful good Heaven, the chaos and evil of the Abyss, the regimented lawful evil of Hell, and the capricious freedom and joys of chaotic good Elysium. Powerful spellcasters can contact the Outer Planes for advice or guidance with spells like @emph{commune} and @emph{contact outer plane}, or can conjure allies with spells like @emph{planar ally} or @emph{summon monster}.

@strong{Demiplanes}: This catchall category covers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes but have measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of planes are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across. There are countless demiplanes adrift in reality, and while most are connected to the Astral Plane and Ethereal Plane, some are cut off entirely from the transitive planes and can only be accessed by well-hidden portals or obscure magic spells.

@node Layered Planes
@section Layered Planes
@anchor{#layered-planes}
Infinities may be broken into smaller infinities, and planes into smaller, related planes. These layers are effectively separate planes of existence, and each layer can have its own features and qualities. Layers are connected to each other through a variety of planar gates, natural vortices, paths, and shifting borders.

Access to a layered plane from elsewhere usually happens on the first layer of the plane, which can be either the top or bottom layer, depending on the specific plane. Most fixed access points (such as portals and natural vortices) reach this layer, which makes it the gateway for other layers of the plane. The @emph{plane shift} spell generally deposits the spellcaster on the first layer of the plane.

@node How Planes Interact
@section How Planes Interact
@anchor{#how-planes-interact}
Two planes that are separate do not overlap or directly connect to each other. They are like planets in different orbits. The only way to get from one separate plane to the other is to go through a third plane, such as a Transitive Plane.

@strong{Coterminous Planes}: Planes that touch at specific points are coterminous. Where they touch, a connection exists, and travelers can leave one reality behind and enter the other.

@strong{Coexistent Planes}: If a link between two planes can be created at any point, the two planes are coexistent. These planes overlap each other completely. A coexistent plane can be reached from anywhere on the plane it overlaps. When moving on a coexistent plane, it is often possible to see into or interact with the plane with which it coexists.

Corrosive acids deals 1d6 points of damage per round of exposure except in the case of total immersion (such as in a vat of acid), which deals 10d6 points of damage per round. An attack with acid, such as from a hurled vial or a monster's spittle, counts as a round of exposure.

The fumes from most acids are inhaled poisons. Those who are adjacent to a large body of acid must make a DC 13 [Fortitude] save or take 1 point of [Constitution] damage each round. This poison does not have a frequency, a creature is safe as soon as it moves away from the acid.

Creatures immune to acid's caustic properties might still drown in it if they are totally immersed (see Drowning).

@node Cold Dangers
@section Cold Dangers
@anchor{#cold-dangers}
Cold and exposure deal nonlethal damage to the victim. A character cannot recover from the damage dealt by a cold environment until she gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character has taken an amount of nonlethal damage equal to her total hit points, any further damage from a cold environment is lethal damage.

An unprotected character in cold weather (below 40° F)must make a [Fortitude] save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description).

In conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0° F), an unprotected character must make a [Fortitude] save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on each failed save. A character who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well. Characters wearing a cold weather outfit only need check once per hour for cold and exposure damage.

A character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as [fatigued]). These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.

Extreme cold (below --20° F) deals 1d6 points of lethal damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a [Fortitude] save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.

@end menu

@node Ice Effects
@subsection Ice Effects
@anchor{#ice-effects}
Characters walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by ice, and the DC for Acrobatics checks increases by +5. Characters in prolonged contact with ice might run the risk of taking damage from severe cold.

@node Darkness
@section Darkness
@anchor{#darkness}
Darkvision allows many characters and monsters to see perfectly well without any light at all, but characters with normal or low-light vision can be rendered completely blind by putting out the lights. Torches or lanterns can be blown out by sudden gusts of subterranean wind, magical light sources can be dispelled or countered, or magical traps might create fields of impenetrable darkness.

In many cases, some characters or monsters might be able to see while others are blinded. For purposes of the following points, a blinded creature is one who simply can't see through the surrounding darkness.

Creatures blinded by darkness lose the ability to deal extra damage due to precision (for example, via sneak attack or a duelist's precise strike ability).

Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall [prone]. Blinded creatures can't run or charge.

All opponents have total concealment from a blinded creature, so the blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in combat. A blinded creature must first pinpoint the location of an opponent in order to attack the right square; if the blinded creature launches an attack without pinpointing its foe, it attacks a random square within its reach. For ranged attacks or spells against a foe whose location is not pinpointed, roll to determine which adjacent square the blinded creature is facing; its attack is directed at the closest target that lies in that direction.

A blinded creature loses its [Dexterity] modifier to [AC] (if positive) and takes a --2 penalty to [AC].

A blinded creature takes a --4 penalty on Perception checks and most Strength- and [Dexterity]-based skill checks, including any with an armor check penalty. A creature blinded by darkness automatically fails any skill check relying on vision.

Creatures blinded by darkness cannot use gaze attacks and are immune to gaze attacks.

A creature blinded by darkness can make a Perception check as a free action each round in order to locate foes (DC equal to opponents' Stealth checks). A successful check lets a blinded character hear an unseen creature “over there somewhere.” It's almost impossible to pinpoint the location of an unseen creature. A Perception check that beats the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature's square (but the unseen creature still has total concealment from the blinded creature).

A blinded creature can grope about to find unseen creatures. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent squares using a standard action. If an unseen target is in the designated square, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has pinpointed the unseen creature's current location. If the unseen creature moves, its location is once again unknown.

If a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the blinded character pinpoints the location of the creature that struck him (until the unseen creature moves, of course). The only exception is if the unseen creature has a reach greater than 5 feet (in which case the blinded character knows the location of the unseen opponent, but has not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged attack (in which case the blinded character knows the general direction of the foe, but not his location).

A creature with the scent ability automatically pinpoints unseen creatures within 5 feet of its location.

@node Falling
@section Falling
@anchor{#falling}
Creatures that fall take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6. Creatures that take lethal damage from a fall land in a [prone] position.

If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. A DC 15 Acrobatics check allows the character to avoid any damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts any damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. Thus, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same character deliberately jumps, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 2d6 points of lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a successful Acrobatics check, he takes only 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 1d6 points of lethal damage from the plunge.

Falls onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert the first 1d6 of damage to nonlethal damage. This reduction is cumulative with reduced damage due to deliberate jumps and the Acrobatics skill.

A character cannot cast a spell while falling, unless the fall is greater than 500 feet or the spell is an immediate action, such as @emph{feather fall}. Casting a spell while falling requires a concentration check with a DC equal to 20 + the spell's level. Casting @emph{teleport} or a similar spell while falling does not end your momentum, it just changes your location, meaning that you still take falling damage, even if you arrive atop a solid surface.

@strong{Falling into Water}: Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, the first 20 feet of falling do no damage. The next 20 feet do nonlethal damage (1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, falling damage is lethal damage (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).

Characters who deliberately dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 Swim check or DC 15 Acrobatics check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. The DC of the check, however, increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.

@end float
Just as characters take damage when they fall more than 10 feet, so too do they take damage when they are hit by falling objects.

Objects that fall upon characters deal damage based on their size and the distance they have fallen. Table: Damage from Falling Objects determines the amount of damage dealt by an object based on its size. Note that this assumes that the object is made of dense, heavy material, such as stone. Objects made of lighter materials might deal as little as half the listed damage, subject to GM discretion. For example, a Huge boulder that hits a character deals 6d6 points of damage, whereas a Huge wooden wagon might deal only 3d6 damage. In addition, if an object falls less than 30 feet, it deals half the listed damage. If an object falls more than 150 feet, it deals double the listed damage. Note that a falling object takes the same amount of damage as it deals.

Dropping an object on a creature requires a ranged touch attack. Such attacks generally have a range increment of 20 feet. If an object falls on a creature (instead of being thrown), that creature can make a DC 15 [Reflex] save to halve the damage if he is aware of the object. Falling objects that are part of a trap use the trap rules instead of these general guidelines.

@node Heat Dangers

Heat deals nonlethal damage that cannot be recovered from until the character gets cooled off (reaches shade, survives until nightfall, gets doused in water, is targeted by @emph{endure elements}, and so forth). Once a character has taken an amount of nonlethal damage equal to her total hit points, any further damage from a hot environment is lethal damage.

A character in very hot conditions (above 90° F) must make a [Fortitude] saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a --4 penalty on their saves. A character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).

In severe heat (above 110° F), a character must make a [Fortitude] save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a --4 penalty on their saves. A character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and might be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well (see the Survival skill in [Using Skills]). Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per each 10-minute period).

A character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure now suffers from heatstroke and is [fatigued]. These penalties end when the character recovers from the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.

Extreme heat (air temperature over 140° F, fire, boiling water, lava) deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures deals 1d6 points of fire damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a [Fortitude] save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a --4 penalty on their saves.

Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the character is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of damage per round of exposure.

@node Catching on Fire
@subsection Catching on Fire
@anchor{#catching-on-fire}
Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and non-instantaneous magic fires might find their clothes, hair, or equipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous duration don't normally set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these come and go in a flash.

Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 [Reflex] save to avoid this fate. If a character's clothes or hair catch fire, he takes 1d6 points of damage immediately. In each subsequent round, the burning character must make another [Reflex] saving throw. Failure means he takes another 1d6 points of damage that round. Success means that the fire has gone out---that is, once he succeeds on his saving throw, he's no longer on fire.

A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by jumping into enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the like permits the character another save with a +4 bonus.

Those whose clothes or equipment catch fire must make DC 15 [Reflex] saves for each item. Flammable items that fail take the same amount of damage as the character.

@node Lava Effects
@subsection Lava Effects
@anchor{#lava-effects}
Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of fire damage per round of exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when a character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals 20d6 points of fire damage per round.

Damage from lava continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round). Immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity or resistance to fire, lava or magma. A creature immune to fire might still drown if completely immersed in lava (see Drowning).

@node Smoke Effects
@section Smoke Effects
@anchor{#smoke-effects}
A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a [Fortitude] save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Smoke obscures vision, giving concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

@node Starvation and Thirst
@section Starvation and Thirst
@anchor{#starvation-and-thirst}
Characters might find themselves without food or water and with no means to obtain them. In normal climates, Medium characters need at least a gallon of fluids and about a pound of decent food per day to avoid starvation. (Small characters need half as much.) In very hot climates, characters need two or three times as much water to avoid dehydration.

A character can go without water for 1 day plus a number of hours equal to his [Constitution] score. After this time, the character must make a [Constitution] check each hour (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Characters that take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to their total hit points begin to take lethal damage instead.

A character can go without food for 3 days, in growing discomfort. After this time, the character must make a [Constitution] check each day (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Characters that take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to their total hit points begin to take lethal damage instead.

Characters who have taken nonlethal damage from lack of food or water are [fatigued]. Nonlethal damage from thirst or starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as needed---not even magic that restores hit points heals this damage.

@node Suffocation
@section Suffocation
@anchor{#suffocation}
A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of [Constitution]. If a character takes a standard or full-round action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check in order to continue holding her breath. The check must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.

When the character fails one of these [Constitution] checks, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls [unconscious] (0 hit points). In the following round, she drops to --1 hit points and is [dying]. In the third round, she suffocates.

@strong{Slow Suffocation}: A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Once rendered [unconscious] through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters.

@node Water Dangers
@section Water Dangers
@anchor{#water-dangers}
Any character can wade in relatively calm water that isn't over his head, no check required. Similarly, swimming in calm water only requires Swim skill checks with a DC of 10. Trained swimmers can just take 10. Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear makes any attempt at swimming much more difficult (see the Swim skill description)@emph{.}

By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. Characters must make a successful DC 15 Swim check or a DC 15 Strength check to avoid going under. On a failed check, the character takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per round (1d6 points of lethal damage if flowing over rocks and cascades).

Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a navigational hazard, but worse, deals water pressure damage of 1d6 points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the surface. A successful [Fortitude] save (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute. Very cold water deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hypothermia per minute of exposure.
@menu
* Drowning::
@end menu

@node Drowning
@subsection Drowning
@anchor{#drowning}
Any character can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to twice her [Constitution] score. If a character takes a standard or full-round action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check every round in order to continue holding her breath. Each round, the DC increases by 1.

When the character finally fails her [Constitution] check, she begins to drown. In the first round, she falls [unconscious] (0 hp). In the following round, she drops to --1 hit points and is [dying]. In the third round, she drowns.

[Unconscious] characters must begin making [Constitution] checks immediately upon being submerged (or upon becoming [unconscious] if the character was conscious when submerged). Once she fails one of these checks, she immediately drops to --1 (or loses 1 additional hit point, if her total is below --1). On the following round, she drowns.

It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} one arrow of acid

@strong{Duration} 1 round + 1 round per three levels

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

An arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a [ranged touch attack] to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the acid, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4 points of damage in each round.

Acid Fog

@strong{Acid Fog}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [acid]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Acid fog}creates a billowing mass of misty vapors like the @emph{[solid fog]}spell. In addition to slowing down creatures and obscuring sight, this spell's vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it.

Acid Splash

@strong{Acid Splash}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation) [acid]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one missile of acid

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage. This acid disappears after 1 round.

Aid

@strong{Aid}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none;@strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Aid}grants the target a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects, plus temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + caster level (to a maximum of 1d8+10 temporary hit points at caster level 10th).

Air Walk

@strong{Air Walk}

@strong{School}transmutation [air]; @strong{Level} cleric 4, druid 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature (Gargantuan or smaller) touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to half the air walker's normal speed.

A strong wind (21+ miles per hour) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of a creature's turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the @emph{air walk}spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an @emph{[antimagic field]}.

You can cast @emph{air walk}on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air. You can train a mount to move with the aid of @emph{air walk}(counts as a trick; see Handle Animal skill) with 1 week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Alarm

@strong{Alarm}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A@emph{larm}creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the @emph{alarm}. You decide at the time of casting whether the @emph{alarm}will be mental or audible in nature.

@emph{Mental Alarm}: A mental @emph{alarm}alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A @emph{[silence]}spell has no effect on a mental @emph{alarm}.

@emph{Audible Alarm}: An audible @emph{alarm}produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.

In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a @emph{[silence]}spell cannot hear the ringing.

Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the @emph{alarm}.

@emph{Alarm}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Align Weapon

@strong{Align Weapon}

@strong{School} transmutation [see text]; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target}weapon touched or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

@emph{Align weapon}makes a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the [damage reduction] of certain creatures. This spell has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. When you make a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, @emph{align weapon}is a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful spell, respectively.

Alter Self

@strong{Alter Self}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to assume)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the humanoid type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: [darkvision] 60 feet, [low-light vision], [scent], and swim 30 feet.

@emph{Small creature}: If the form you take is that of a Small humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Dexterity].

@emph{Medium creature}: If the form you take is that of a Medium humanoid, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Strength].

Analyze Dweomer

@strong{Analyze Dweomer}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a ruby and gold lens worth 1,500 gp)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one object or creature per caster level

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can observe magical auras. Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a free action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions (including any curse effects), how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level.

An attended object may attempt a [Will] save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it. An object that makes its save cannot be affected by any other @emph{analyze dweomer}spells for 24 hours.

@emph{Analyze dweomer}does not function when used on an artifact.

Animal Growth

@strong{Animal Growth}

@strong{School}transmutation; @strong{Level}druid 5, ranger 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target}one animal (Gargantuan or smaller)

@strong{Duration}1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal's size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to [Strength] and a +4 size bonus to [Constitution] (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a --2 size penalty to [Dexterity]. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to [AC], attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a [Strength] check (using its increased [Strength]) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it---the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by the animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment.

Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.

The spell gives no means of command over an enlarged animal.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

Animal Messenger

@strong{Animal Messenger}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, druid 2, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a morsel of food the animal likes)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one Tiny animal

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.

Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can't find a destination on its own. You can attach a small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.

During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it's written in a language he doesn't know, for example).

Animal Shapes

@strong{Animal Shapes}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}druid 8

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, DF

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets}up to one willing creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each other.

@strong{Duration}1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}none, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes (harmless)

As @emph{[beast shape III]}, except you change the form of up to one willing creature per caster level into an animal of your choice; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures. All creatures must take the same kind of animal form. Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients. In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.

Animal Trance

@strong{Animal Trance}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 2, druid 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} animals or magical beasts with [Intelligence] 1 or 2

@strong{Duration} concentration

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Your swaying motions and music (or singing, or chanting) compel animals and magical beasts to do nothing but watch you. Only a creature with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2 can be [fascinated] by this spell. Roll 2d6 to determine the total number of HD worth of creatures that you fascinate. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected.

Animate Dead

@strong{Animate Dead}

@strong{School} necromancy [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (an onyx gem worth at least 25 gp per Hit Die of the undead)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} one or more corpses touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell turns corpses into undead skeletons or zombies that obey your spoken commands.

The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific kind of creature) entering the place. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.

Regardless of the type of undead you create with this spell, you can't create more HD of undead than twice your caster level with a single casting of @emph{animate dead}. The @emph{[desecrate]}spell doubles this limit.

The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Undead you control through the @ref{#command-undead,Command Undead} feat do not count toward this limit.

@emph{Skeletons}: A skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse or skeleton. The corpse must have bones. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.

@emph{Zombies}: A zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The corpse must be that of a creature with a physical anatomy.

Animate Objects

@strong{Animate Objects}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 6, cleric 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} one Small object per caster level; see text

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life. Each such animated object then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate.

An animated object can be of any nonmagical material. You may animate one Small or smaller object or a corresponding number of larger objects as follows: A Medium object counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

This spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

@emph{Animate objects}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Animate Plants

@strong{Animate Plants}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one Large plant per three caster levels or all plants within range; see text

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level or 1 hour/level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You imbue inanimate plants with mobility and a semblance of life. Each animated plant then immediately attacks whomever or whatever you initially designate as though it were an animated object of the appropriate size category. You may animate one Large or smaller plant, or a number of larger plants as follows: a Huge plant counts as two Large or smaller plants, a Gargantuan plant as four, and a Colossal plant as eight. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

Use the statistics for animated objects, except that plants smaller than Large don't have hardness.

@emph{Animate plants}cannot affect plant creatures, nor does it affect nonliving vegetable material.

@emph{Entangle}: Alternatively, you may imbue all plants within range with a degree of mobility, which allows them to entwine around creatures in the area. This usage of the spell duplicates the effect of an @emph{[entangle]}spell. [Spell resistance] does not keep creatures from being [entangled]. This effect lasts 1 hour per caster level.

Animate Rope

@strong{Animate Rope}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one rope-like object, length up to 50 ft. + 5 ft./level; see text

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none;@strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.

The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it---it does not snake outward---so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, [AC] 10, and requires a DC 23 [Strength] check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a [Reflex] saving throw to become [entangled]. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level to cast a spell. An [entangled] creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.

Antilife Shell

@strong{Antilife Shell}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 6, druid 6

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Range} 10 ft.

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You bring into being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most types of living creatures.

The effect hedges out animals, aberrations, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and vermin, but not constructs, elementals, outsiders, or undead.

This spell may be used only defensively, not aggressively. Forcing an abjuration barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay collapses the barrier.

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines.

An @emph{antimagic field}suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an @emph{antimagic field}counts against the suppressed spell's duration.

Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an @emph{antimagic field.}They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent winked out counts normally against the duration of the conjuration that is maintaining the creature. If you cast @emph{antimagic field}in an area occupied by a summoned creature that has [spell resistance], you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the creature's [spell resistance] to make it wink out. (The effects of instantaneous conjurations are not affected by an @emph{antimagic field}because the conjuration itself is no longer in effect, only its result.)

A normal creature can enter the area, as can normal missiles. Furthermore, while a magic sword does not function magically within the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The spell has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting (unless they have been summoned, in which case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals, undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless summoned. These creatures' spell-like or supernatural abilities may be temporarily nullified by the field. @emph{[Dispel magic]}does not remove the field.

Two or more @emph{antimagic fields}sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain spells, such as @emph{[wall of force], [prismatic sphere]}, and @emph{[prismatic wall],}remain unaffected by @emph{antimagic field}. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

Should a creature be larger than the area enclosed by the barrier, any part of it that lies outside the barrier is unaffected by the field.

Antipathy

@strong{Antipathy}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 hour

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a lump of alum soaked in vinegar)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named.

Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item.

A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's [Dexterity] score by 4 points.

@emph{Antipathy}counters and dispels @emph{[sympathy]}.

Antiplant Shell

@strong{Antiplant Shell}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} druid 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 10 ft.

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The @emph{antiplant shell}spell creates an invisible, mobile barrier that keeps all creatures within the shell protected from attacks by plant creatures or animated plants. As with many abjuration spells, forcing the barrier against creatures that the spell keeps at bay strains and collapses the field.

Arcane Eye

@strong{Arcane Eye}

@strong{School} divination (scrying); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)

@strong{Range} unlimited

@strong{Effect}magical sensor

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create an invisible magical sensor that sends you visual information. You can create the @emph{arcane eye}at any point you can see, but it can then travel outside your line of sight without hindrance. An @emph{arcane eye}travels at 30 feet per round (300 feet per minute) if viewing an area ahead as a human would (primarily looking at the floor) or 10 feet per round (100 feet per minute) if examining the ceiling and walls as well as the floor ahead. It sees exactly as you would see if you were there.

The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage, but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The eye can't enter another plane of existence, even through a @emph{[gate]}or similar magical portal.

You must concentrate to use an @emph{arcane eye.}If you do not concentrate, the eye is inert until you again concentrate.

Arcane Lock

@strong{Arcane Lock}

@strong{School}abjuration; @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}door, chest, or portal touched, up to 30 sq. ft./level in size

@strong{Duration}permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

An @emph{arcane lock}spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. You can freely pass your own @emph{arcane lock}without affecting it. If the locked object has a lock, the DC to open that lock increases by 10 while it remains attached to the object. If the object does not have a lock, this spell creates one that can only be opened with a DC 20 Disable Device skill check. A door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}or @emph{[knock]}spell. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or portal affected by this spell. A @emph{[knock]}spell does not remove an @emph{arcane lock;}it only suppresses the effect for 10 minutes.

Arcane Mark

@strong{Arcane Mark}

@strong{School} universal; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Effect} one personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An @emph{arcane mark}spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a @emph{[detect magic]}spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

@emph{[See invisibility], [true seeing]}, a @emph{gem of seeing}, or a @emph{robe of eyes}likewise allows the user to see an invisible @emph{arcane mark.}A @emph{[read magic]}spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an @emph{erase}spell.

If an @emph{arcane mark}is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

@emph{Arcane mark}must be cast on an object prior to casting @emph{[instant summons]}on the same object (see that spell description for details).

Arcane Sight

@strong{Arcane Sight}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a @emph{[detect magic]}spell, but @emph{arcane sight}does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly.

You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level, as noted in the description of the @emph{[detect magic]}spell. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell-like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

As with @emph{[detect magic],} you can use this spell to identify the properties of magic items, but not artifacts.

@emph{Arcane sight}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Arcane Sight, Greater}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions like @emph{[arcane sight],}except that you automatically know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you see.

Unlike @emph{[arcane sight]}, this spell cannot be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Astral Projection

@strong{Astral Projection}

@strong{School}necromancy; @strong{Level}cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Casting Time} 30 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (1,000 gp jacinth)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} you plus one additional willing creature touched per two caster levels

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you to project an astral body onto another plane altogether. You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.

You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.

While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an [incorporeal] silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent [negative levels] if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.

You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as @emph{[dispel magic]}cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).

When this spell ends, your astral body and all of its gear, vanishes.

Atonement

@strong{Atonement}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 hour

@strong{Components} V, S, M (burning incense), F (a set of prayer beads or other prayer device worth at least 500 gp), DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell removes the burden of misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, @emph{atonement}operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings). @emph{Atonement}may be cast for one of several purposes, depending on the version selected.

@emph{Reverse Magical Alignment Change}: If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, @emph{atonement}returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.

@emph{Restore Class}: A paladin, or other class, who has lost her class features due to violating the alignment restrictions of her class may have her class features restored by this spell.

@emph{Restore Cleric or Druid Spell Powers}: A cleric or druid who has lost the ability to cast spells by incurring the anger of her deity may regain that ability by seeking @emph{atonement}from another cleric of the same deity or another druid. If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession.

@emph{Redemption or Temptation}: You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. This use of the spell does not work on outsiders or any creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.

Though the spell description refers to evil acts, @emph{atonement}can be used on any creature that has performed acts against its alignment, regardless of the actual alignment in question.

@emph{Note}: Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of @emph{atonement}offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.

Augury

@strong{Augury}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (incense worth at least 25 gp), F (a set of marked sticks or bones worth at least 25 gp)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

An @emph{augury}can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.

The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the @emph{augury}succeeds, you get one of four results:

@itemize
@item
Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).
@item
Woe (for bad results).
@item
Weal and woe (for both).
@item
Nothing (for actions that don't have especially good or bad results).
@end itemize

If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful @emph{augury.}

The @emph{augury}can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All @emph{auguries}cast by the same person about the same topic use the same die result as the first casting.

Awaken

@strong{Awaken}

@strong{School}transmutation; @strong{Level}druid 5

@strong{Casting Time}24 hours

@strong{Components}V, S, M (herbs and oils worth 2,000 gp), DF

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target} animal or tree touched

@strong{Duration}instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You awaken a tree or animal to human-like sentience. To succeed, you must make a [Will] save (DC 10 + the animal's current HD, or the HD the tree will have once awakened). The awakened animal or tree is friendly toward you. You have no special empathy or connection with a creature you awaken, although it serves you in specific tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. If you cast @emph{awaken} again, any previously awakened creatures remain friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is in their best interests.

An awakened tree has characteristics as if it were an animated object, except that it gains the plant type and its [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma] scores are each 3d6. An awakened plant gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it has senses similar to a human's.

An awakened animal gets 3d6 [Intelligence], +1d3 [Charisma], and +2 HD. Its type becomes magical beast (augmented animal). An awakened animal can't serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount.

An awakened tree or animal can speak one language that you know, plus one additional language that you know per point of [Intelligence] bonus (if any). This spell does not function on an animal or plant with an [Intelligence] greater than 2.

In general, a character can sell something for half its listed price, including weapons, armor, gear, and magic items. This also includes character-created items.

Trade goods are the exception to the half-price rule. A trade good, in this sense, is a valuable good that can be easily exchanged almost as if it were cash itself.

@node Weapons
@chapter Weapons
@anchor{#weapons}
From the common longsword to the exotic dwarven urgrosh, weapons come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target's [AC], the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).

@strong{Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons}: Anybody but a druid, monk, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons possessed by their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls.

@strong{Melee and Ranged Weapons}: Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

@emph{Reach Weapons}: Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.

@emph{Double Weapons}: Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaves, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with [two-weapon combat], just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon---only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

@emph{Thrown Weapons}: Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his [Strength] modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range column on Table: Weapons), and a character who does so takes a --4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

@emph{Projectile Weapons}: Blowguns, light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, halfling sling staves, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no [Strength] bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low [Strength], apply it to damage rolls when he uses a bow or a sling.

@emph{Ammunition}: Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), darts (for blowguns), or sling bullets (for slings and halfling sling staves). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting [masterwork] or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.

@strong{Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons}: This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon's size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

@emph{Light}: A light weapon is used in one hand. It is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and can be used while grappling ). Add the wielder's [Strength] modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or half the wielder's [Strength] bonus if it's used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the [Strength] bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.

@emph{One-Handed}: A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder's [Strength] bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his [Strength] bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character's [Strength] bonus to damage rolls.

@emph{Two-Handed}: Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character's [Strength] bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

@strong{Weapon Size}: Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.

A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

@emph{Inappropriately Sized Weapons}: A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized for it. A cumulative --2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon, a --4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.

The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon's designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.

@strong{Improvised Weapons}: Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a --4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons).

@strong{Cost}: This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as a scabbard or quiver.

This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.

@end float
@strong{Dmg}: These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled “Dmg (S)” is for Small weapons. The column labeled “Dmg (M)” is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.

@strong{Critical}: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.

Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

×@emph{2}: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.

×@emph{3}: The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.

×@emph{3/}×@emph{4}: One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

×@emph{4}: The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

@emph{19--20/}×@emph{2}: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

@emph{18--20/}×@emph{2}: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

@strong{Range}: Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative --2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a --4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.

@strong{Weight}: This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon's description for details.

@strong{Type}: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

@strong{Special}: Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.

@emph{Brace}: If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character ).

@emph{Disarm}: When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.

@emph{Double}: You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way---only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

@emph{Monk}: A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows ).

@emph{Nonlethal}: These weapons deal nonlethal damage (see [Combat]).

@emph{Reach}: You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

@emph{Trip}: You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.

1 Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.

2 A weapon with two types is both types if the entry specifies “and,” or either type (wielder's choice) if the entry specifies “or.”

Weapons found on Table: Weapons are described below. Splash weapons are described under @ref{#special-substances-and-items,Special Substances and Items}.

@strong{Arrows}: An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (--4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows.

@strong{Axe, Orc Double}: A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon.

@strong{Blowgun}: Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired. For a list of appropriate poisons, see @ref{#poison,Poison}.

@strong{Bolas}: A bolas is a pair of weights, connected by a thin rope or cord. You can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas.

@strong{Bolts}: A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (--4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (crit ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts (or 5, for a repeating crossbow).

@strong{Bullets, Sling}: Bullets are shaped metal balls, designed to be used by a sling or halfling sling staff. Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets.

@strong{Chain, Spiked}: A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length, covered in wicked barbs. You can use the [Weapon Finesse] feat to apply your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your [Strength] modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

@strong{Crossbow, Hand}: You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with [two light weapons].

@strong{Crossbow, Heavy}: You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a --4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with [two one-handed weapons]. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

@strong{Crossbow, Light}: You draw a light crossbow back by pulling a lever. Loading a light crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a --2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with [two light weapons]. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing.

@strong{Crossbow, Repeating}: The repeating crossbow (whether heavy or light) holds 5 crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts.

@strong{Curve Blade, Elven}: Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade due to its flexible metal.

You can use the [Weapon Finesse] feat to apply your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your [Strength] modifier to attack rolls with an elven curve blade sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

@strong{Dagger}: A dagger has a blade that is about 1 foot in length. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body (see [Using Skills]).

@strong{Dagger, Punching}: A punching dagger's blade is attached to a horizontal handle that projects out from the fist when held.

@strong{Flail}: A flail consists of a spiked metal ball, connected to a handle by a sturdy chain.

@strong{Flail, Dire}: A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft.

@strong{Flail, Heavy}: Similar to a flail, a heavy flail has a larger metal ball and a longer handle.

@strong{Gauntlet}: This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of gauntlets.

@strong{Gauntlet, Spiked}: The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of spiked gauntlets.

@strong{Glaive}: A glaive is a simple blade, mounted to the end of a pole about 7 feet in length.

@strong{Greatsword}: This immense two-handed sword is about 5 feet in length.

@strong{Guisarme}: A guisarme is an 8-foot-long shaft with a blade and a hook mounted at the tip.

@strong{Halberd}: A halberd is similar to a 5-foot-long spear, but it also has a small, axe-like head mounted near the tip.

@strong{Hammer, Gnome Hooked}: A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon---an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (crit ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (crit ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.

@strong{Javelin}: A javelin is a thin throwing spear . Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a --4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon.

@strong{Kama}: Similar to a sickle, a kama is a short, curved blade attached to a simple handle.

@strong{Kukri}: A kukri is a curved blade, about 1 foot in length.

@strong{Lance}: A lance deals double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. While mounted, you can wield a lance with one hand.

@strong{Longbow}: At almost 5 feet in height, a longbow is made up of one solid piece of carefully curved wood. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. A longbow is too unwieldy to use while you are mounted. If you have a penalty for low [Strength], apply it to damage rolls when you use a longbow. If you have a [Strength] bonus, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow (see below), but not when you use a regular longbow.

@strong{Longbow, Composite}: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum [Strength] modifier to use with proficiency). If your [Strength] bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a --2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a [Strength] modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average [Strength] score; this feature allows you to add your [Strength] bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of [Strength] bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low [Strength], apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow.

For purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

@strong{Longspear}: A longspear is about 8 feet in length.

@strong{Longsword}: This sword is about 3-1/2 feet in length.

@strong{Mace}: A mace is made up of an ornate metal head attached to a simple wooden or metal shaft.

@strong{Mace, Heavy}: A heavy mace has a larger head and a longer handle than a normal mace.

@strong{Morningstar}: A morningstar is a spiked metal ball, affixed to the top of a long handle.

@strong{Net}: A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is [entangled]. An entangled creature takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls and a --4 penalty on [Dexterity], can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding on an opposed [Strength] check while holding it, the [entangled] creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the [entangled] creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.

An [entangled] creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25 [Strength] check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.

A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a --4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so.

@strong{Nunchaku}: A nunchaku is made up of two wooden or metal bars connected by a small length of rope or chain.

@strong{Quarterstaff}: A quarterstaff is a simple piece of wood, about 5 feet in length.

@strong{Ranseur}: Similar in appearance to a trident, a ranseur has a single spear at its tip, flanked by a pair of short, curving blades.

@strong{Rapier}: You can use the [Weapon Finesse] feat to apply your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your [Strength] modifier to attack rolls with a rapier sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a rapier in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your [Strength] bonus to damage.

@strong{Sai}: A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an enemy's weapon. With a sai, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to sunder an enemy's weapon. Though pointed, a sai is used primarily to bludgeon foes and to disarm weapons.

@strong{Shield, Heavy or Light}: You can [bash] with a shield instead of using it for defense.

@strong{Shortbow}: A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood, about 3 feet in length. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low [Strength], apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high [Strength], you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow (see below), but not a regular shortbow.

@strong{Shortbow, Composite}: You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular [strength] rating (that is, each requires a minimum [Strength] modifier to use with proficiency). If your [Strength] bonus is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a --2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a [Strength] modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average [Strength] score; this feature allows you to add your [Strength] bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of [Strength] bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. If you have a penalty for low [Strength], apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow.

For purposes of Weapon Proficiency, [Weapon Focus], and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.

@strong{Shortspear}: A shortspear is about 3 feet in length, making it a suitable thrown weapon.

@strong{Shortsword}: This sword is about 2 feet in length.

@strong{Shuriken}: A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and what happens to them after they are thrown.

@strong{Siangham}: This weapon is a handheld shaft fitted with a pointed tip for stabbing foes.

@strong{Sling}: A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your [Strength] modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a --1 penalty on attack rolls.

@strong{Sling Staff, Halfling}: Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your [Strength] modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a --1 penalty on attack rolls.

A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.

@strong{Spear}: A spear is 5 feet in length and can be thrown.

@strong{Spiked Armor}: You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See Armor, below, for details.

@strong{Spiked Shield, Heavy or Light}: You can [bash] with a spiked shield instead of using it for defense.

@strong{Starknife}: From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend like points on a compass rose. A wielder can stab with the starknife or throw it.

@strong{Strike, Unarmed}: A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the [Improved Unarmed Strike] feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the [Weapon Finesse] feat to apply your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your [Strength] modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons ).

@strong{Sword, Bastard}: A bastard sword is about 4 feet in length, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A character can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.

@strong{Sword, Two-Bladed}: A two-bladed sword is a double weapon---twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes.

@strong{Trident}: A trident has three metal prongs at end of a 4-foot-long shaft. This weapon can be thrown.

@strong{Urgrosh, Dwarven}: A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon---an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon. The other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.

@strong{Waraxe, Dwarven}: A dwarven waraxe has a large, ornate head mounted to a thick handle, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.

@strong{Whip}: A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.

You can use the [Weapon Finesse] feat to apply your [Dexterity] modifier instead of your [Strength] modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

@node Masterwork Weapons
@section Masterwork Weapons
@anchor{#masterwork-weapons}
A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).

Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.

All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.

Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.

@node Armor
@chapter Armor
@anchor{#armor}
For most, armor is the simplest way to protect oneself in a world of rampant threats and dangers. Many characters can wear only the simplest of armors, and only some can use shields. To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.

Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table: Armor and Shields).

@strong{Cost}: The cost in gold pieces of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Table: Armor for Unusual Creatures for armor prices for other creatures.

@strong{Armor/Shield Bonus}: Each type of armor grants an armor bonus to [AC], while shields grant a shield bonus to [AC]. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn't stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.

@strong{Maximum [Dex] Bonus}: This number is the maximum [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] that this type of armor allows. [Dexterity] bonuses in excess of this number are reduced to this number for the purposes of determining the wearer's [AC]. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer's ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn't affect any other [Dexterity]-related abilities.

Even if a character's [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

A character's encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also restrict the maximum [Dexterity] bonus that can be applied to his @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}.

@emph{Shields}: Shields do not affect a character's maximum [Dexterity] bonus, except for tower shields.

@strong{Armor Check Penalty}: Any armor heavier than leather, as well as any shield, hurts a character's ability to use [Dexterity]- and [Strength]-based skills. An armor check penalty applies to all [Dexterity]- and [Strength]-based skill checks. A character's encumbrance may also incur an armor check penalty.

@emph{Shields}: If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.

@emph{Nonproficient with Armor Worn}: A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he is not proficient takes the armor's (and/or shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls as well as on all [Dexterity]- and [Strength]-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for shields.

@emph{Sleeping in Armor}: A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He takes a --2 penalty on [Strength] and [Dexterity] and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.

@strong{Arcane Spell Failure Chance}: Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor and use shields without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.

@emph{Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor}: A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure check. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is the percentage chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.

@emph{Shields}: If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.

@strong{Speed}: Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table: Armor and Shields is the character's speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf's land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

@emph{Shields}: Shields do not affect a character's speed.

@strong{Weight}: This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.

1 Weight figures are for armor sized to fit Medium characters. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor fitted for Large characters weighs twice as much.

2 When running in heavy armor, you move only triple your speed, not quadruple.

3 A tower shield can instead grant you cover. See the description.

4 Hand not free to cast spells.

Any special benefits or accessories to the types of armor found on Table: Armor and Shields are described below.

@strong{Armor Spikes}: You can have spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing damage (see “spiked armor” on Table: Weapons) on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a --4 penalty on grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a light weapon in this case. (You can't also make an attack with armor spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon, and vice versa.) An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not improve the spikes' effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into magic weapons in their own right.

@strong{Banded Mail}: Banded mail is made up of overlapping strips of metal, fastened to a leather backing. The suit includes gauntlets.

@strong{Breastplate}: Covering only the torso, a breastplate is made up of a single piece of sculpted metal.

@strong{Buckler}: This small metal shield is worn strapped to your forearm. You can use a bow or crossbow without penalty while carrying it. You can also use your shield arm to wield a weapon (whether you are using an off-hand weapon or using your off hand to help wield a two-handed weapon), but you take a --1 penalty on attack rolls while doing so. This penalty stacks with those that may apply for fighting with your off hand and for fighting with two weapons. In any case, if you use a weapon in your off hand, you lose the buckler's [AC] bonus until your next turn. You can cast a spell with somatic components using your shield arm, but you lose the buckler's [AC] bonus until your next turn. You can't make a shield bash with a buckler.

@strong{Chain Shirt}: Covering the torso, this shirt is made up of thousands of interlocking metal rings.

@strong{Chainmail}: Unlike a chain shirt, chainmail covers the legs and arms of the wearer. The suit includes gauntlets.

@strong{Full Plate}: This metal suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 × 100) gold pieces.

@strong{Gauntlet, Locked}: This armored gauntlet has small chains and braces that allow the wearer to attach a weapon to the gauntlet so that it cannot be dropped easily. It provides a +10 bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense to keep from being disarmed in combat. Removing a weapon from a locked gauntlet or attaching a weapon to a locked gauntlet is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

The price given is for a single locked gauntlet. The weight given applies only if you're wearing a breastplate, light armor, or no armor. Otherwise, the locked gauntlet replaces a gauntlet you already have as part of the armor.

While the gauntlet is locked, you can't use the hand wearing it for casting spells or employing skills. (You can still cast spells with somatic components, provided that your other hand is free.)

Like a normal gauntlet, a locked gauntlet lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike.

@strong{Half-Plate}: Combining elements of full plate and chainmail, half-plate includes gauntlets and a helm.

@strong{Hide}: Hide armor is made up of the tanned and preserved skin of any thick-hided beast.

@strong{Leather}: Leather armor is made up of pieces of hard boiled leather carefully sewn together.

@strong{Padded}: Little more than heavy, quilted cloth, this armor provides only the most basic protection.

@strong{Scale Mail}: Scale mail is made up of dozens of small overlapping metal plates. The suit includes gauntlets.

@strong{Shield, Heavy; Wooden or Steel}: You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can't use your shield hand for anything else.

@emph{Wooden or Steel}: Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to spells and effects.

@emph{Shield Bash Attacks}: You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield. See “shield, heavy” on Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its [AC] bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.

@strong{Shield, Light; Wooden or Steel}: You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light shield's weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although you cannot use weapons with it.

@emph{Wooden or Steel}: Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to some spells and effects.

@emph{Shield Bash Attacks}: You can bash an opponent with a light shield. See “shield, light” on Table: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its [AC] bonus until your next turn. An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.

@strong{Shield, Tower}: This massive wooden shield is nearly as tall as you are. In most situations, it provides the indicated shield bonus to your [AC]. As a standard action, however, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover until the beginning of your next turn. When using a tower shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge and no cover for attacks that do not pass through this edge (see [Combat]). The shield does not, however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. You cannot bash with a tower shield, nor can you use your shield hand for anything else.

When employing a tower shield in combat, you take a --2 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance.

@strong{Shield Spikes}: These spikes turn a shield into a martial piercing weapon and increase the damage dealt by a shield bash as if the shield were designed for a creature one size category larger than you (see “spiked shields” on Table: Weapons). You can't put spikes on a buckler or a tower shield. Otherwise, attacking with a spiked shield is like making a shield bash attack.

An enhancement bonus on a spiked shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but a spiked shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right.

@strong{Splint Mail}: Splint mail is made up of metal strips, like banded mail. The suit includes gauntlets.

@strong{Studded Leather}: Similar to leather armor, this suit is reinforced with small metal studs.

@node Masterwork Armor
@section Masterwork Armor
@anchor{#masterwork-armor}
Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.

A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.

The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.

All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.

You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item.

@anchor{#getting-into-and-out-of-armor}
The time required to don armor depends on its type; see Table: Donning Armor.

@strong{Don}: This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.

@strong{Don Hastily}: This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.

@strong{Remove}: This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Removing a shield from the arm and dropping it is only a move action.

2 The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.

@node Special Materials
@chapter Special Materials
@anchor{#special-materials}
Weapons and armor can be crafted using materials that possess innate special properties. If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material.

Each of the special materials described below has a definite game effect. Some creatures have damage reduction making them resistant to all but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons of a particular material. Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons, depending upon the types of creatures they most commonly encounter.

@strong{Adamantine}: Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, this ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20 (see [Additional Rules]). Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/--- if it's light armor, 2/--- if it's medium armor, and 3/--- if it's heavy armor. Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type. Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.

Weapons and armor normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

Type of Adamantine Item Item Cost Modifier ------------------------- -------------------- Ammunition +60 gp per missile Light armor +5,000 gp Medium armor +10,000 gp Heavy armor +15,000 gp Weapon +3,000 gp

@strong{Darkwood}: This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow or spear) made from darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.

Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.

@strong{Dragonhide}: Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does not confer any protection to the wearer. If the armor or shield is later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.

Because dragonhide armor isn't made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.

Dragonhide armor costs twice as much as masterwork armor of that type, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type (double all Craft results).

Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10. The hide of a dragon is typically between 1/2 inch and 1 inch thick.

@strong{Iron, Cold}: This iron, mined deep underground and known for its effectiveness against demons and fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.

Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not. A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.

Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

@strong{Mithral}: Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than steel but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor, and is occasionally used for other items as well. Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor's check penalty to all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum [Dexterity] bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).

An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon's size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot.) Mithral weapons count as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.

Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.

@strong{Silver, Alchemical}: A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes.

On a successful attack with a silvered slashing or piercing weapon, the wielder takes a --1 penalty on the damage roll (with a minimum of 1 point of damage). The alchemical silvering process can't be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn't work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.

Alchemical silver has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.

1 These items weigh one-quarter this amount when made for Small characters. Containers for Small characters also carry one-quarter the normal amount.

2 Relative to similar armor made for a Medium humanoid.

3 See spell description for additional costs. If the additional costs put the spell's total cost above 3,000 gp, that spell is not generally available. Use a spell level of 1/2 for 0-level spells to calculate the cost.

Beyond armor and weapons, a character can carry a whole variety of gear, from rations (to sustain him on long travels), to rope (which is useful in countless circumstances). Most of the common gear carried by adventurers is summarized on Table: Goods and Services.

@node Adventuring Gear
@section Adventuring Gear
@anchor{#adventuring-gear}
Some of the pieces of adventuring gear found on Table: Goods and Services are described below, along with any special benefits they confer on the user (“you”).

@strong{Caltrops}: A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.

Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to [AC]. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.

Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents.

@strong{Candle}: A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the [light level] in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour.

@strong{Chain}: Chain has hardness 10 and 5 hit points. It can be burst with a DC 26 [Strength] check.

@strong{Crowbar}: A crowbar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on [Strength] checks made to force open a door or chest. If used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.

@strong{Flint and Steel}: Lighting a torch with flint and steel is a full-round action, and lighting any other fire with them takes at least that long.

@strong{Grappling Hook}: Throwing a grappling hook requires a ranged attack roll, treating the hook as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Objects with ample places to catch the hook are [AC] 5.

@strong{Hammer}: If a hammer is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a spiked gauntlet of its size.

@strong{Ink}: Ink in colors other than black costs twice as much.

@strong{Jug, Clay}: This basic jug is fitted with a stopper and holds 1 gallon of liquid.

@strong{Lamp, Common}: A lamp illuminates a small area, providing normal light in a 15-foot radius and increasing the [light level] by one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A lamp does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lamp burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.

@strong{Lantern, Bullseye}: A bullseye lantern provides normal light in a 60-foot cone and increases the [light level] by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 120-foot cone (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A bullseye lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.

@strong{Lantern, Hooded}: A hooded lantern sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the [light level] by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A hooded lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on one pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.

@strong{Lock}: The DC to open a lock with the Disable Device skill depends on the lock's quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).

@strong{Manacles, Standard and Masterwork}: Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a [Strength] check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.

Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.

For the same cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.

@strong{Oil}: A pint of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp. You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire (see Special Substances and Items on Table: Goods and Services), except that it takes a full-round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.

You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.

@strong{Pick, Miner's}: If a miner's pick is used in combat, treat it as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals piercing damage equal to that of a heavy pick of its size.

@strong{Ram, Portable}: This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on [Strength] checks made to break open a door and allows a second person to help, automatically increasing your bonus by 2.

@strong{Rope, Hemp}: This rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 [Strength] check.

@strong{Rope, Silk}: This rope has 4 hit points and can be burst with a DC 24 [Strength] check.

@strong{Shovel}: If a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.

@strong{Spyglass}: Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Characters using a spyglass take a --1 penalty on Perception skill checks per 20 feet of distance to the target, if the target is visible.

@strong{Torch}: A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.

@strong{Vial}: A vial is made out of glass or steel and holds 1 ounce of liquid.

@strong{Water Clock}: This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurately to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.

@node Special Substances and Items
@section Special Substances and Items
@anchor{#special-substances-and-items}
Any of these substances except for the everburning torch and holy water can be made by a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill.

@strong{Acid}: You can throw a flask of acid as a [splash weapon]. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 1d6 points of acid damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acid hits takes 1 point of acid damage from the splash.

@strong{Alchemist's Fire}: You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a [splash weapon]. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.

A direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 [Reflex] save. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.

@strong{Antitoxin}: If you drink a vial of antitoxin, you get a +5 alchemical bonus on [Fortitude] saving throws against poison for 1 hour.

@strong{Everburning Torch}: This otherwise normal torch has a @emph{continual flame} spell cast on it. This causes it to shed light @emph{like an ordinary torch, but it does not emit heat or deal fire}damage if used as a weapon.

@strong{Holy Water}: Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.

Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.

Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit). Holy water is made using the @emph{bless water}spell.

@strong{Smokestick}: This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10-foot cube (treat the effect as a @emph{fog cloud}spell, except that a moderate or stronger wind dissipates the smoke in 1 round). The stick is consumed after 1 round, and the smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute.

@strong{Sunrod}: This 1-foot-long, gold-tipped, iron rod glows brightly when struck as a standard action. It sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A sunrod does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It glows for 6 hours, after which the gold tip is burned out and worthless.

@strong{Tanglefoot Bag}: A tanglefoot bag is a small sack filled with tar, resin, and other sticky substances. When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An [entangled] creature takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls and a --4 penalty to [Dexterity] and must make a DC 15 [Reflex] save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 [Reflex] save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.

A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 [Strength] check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the [entangled] creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of @emph{universal solvent} to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.

@strong{Thunderstone}: You can throw this stone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 [Fortitude] save or be [deafened] for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a --4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.

Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square. Treat the target square as [AC] 5.

@strong{Tindertwig}: The alchemical substance on the end of this small, wooden stick ignites when struck against a rough surface. Creating a flame with a tindertwig is much faster than creating a flame with flint and steel (or a magnifying glass) and tinder. Lighting a torch with a tindertwig is a standard action (rather than a full-round action), and lighting any other fire with one is at least a standard action.

@strong{Alchemist's Lab}: This lab is used for making alchemical items, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks. It has no bearing on the costs related to the Craft (alchemy) skill. Without this lab, a character with the Craft (alchemy) skill is assumed to have enough tools to use the skill but not enough to get the +2 bonus that the lab provides.

@strong{Artisan's Tools}: These special tools include the items needed to pursue any craft. Without them, you have to use improvised tools (--2 penalty on Craft checks), if you can do the job at all.

@strong{Artisan's Tools, Masterwork}: These tools serve the same purpose as artisan's tools, but masterwork artisan's tools are the perfect tools for the job, so you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made with them.

@strong{Climber's Kit}: These crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools give you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.

@strong{Disguise Kit}: The kit is the perfect tool for disguise and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. A disguise kit is exhausted after 10 uses.

@strong{Healer's Kit}: This collection of bandages and herbs provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks. A healer's kit is exhausted after 10 uses.

@strong{Holly and Mistletoe}: Druids commonly use these plants as divine focuses when casting spells.

@strong{Holy Symbol, Silver or Wooden}: A holy symbol focuses positive energy and is used by good clerics and paladins (or by neutral clerics who want to cast good spells or channel positive energy). Each religion has its own holy symbol.

@emph{Unholy Symbols}: An unholy symbol is like a holy symbol except that it focuses negative energy and is used by evil clerics (or by neutral clerics who want to cast evil spells or channel negative energy).

@strong{Magnifying Glass}: This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a full-round action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.

@strong{Musical Instrument, Common or Masterwork}: A masterwork instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks involving its use.

@strong{Scale, Merchant's}: A merchant's scale grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.

@strong{Spell Component Pouch}: A spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldn't fit in a pouch.

@strong{Spellbook, Wizard's}: A spellbook has 100 pages of parchment, and each spell takes up one page per spell level (one page each for 0-level spells).

@strong{Thieves' Tools}: This kit contains lockpicks and other tools you need to use the Disable Device skill. Without these tools, you must use improvised tools, and you take a --2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device checks.

@strong{Thieves' Tools, Masterwork}: This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device checks.

@strong{Tool, Masterwork}: This well-made item is the perfect tool for the job. It grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a related skill check (if any). Bonuses provided by multiple masterwork items do not stack.

@node Clothing
@section Clothing
@anchor{#clothing}
All characters begin play with one outfit, valued at 10 gp or less. Additional outfits can be purchased normally.

@strong{Artisan's Outfit}: This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.

@strong{Cleric's Vestments}: These clothes are for performing priestly functions, not for adventuring. Cleric's vestments typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice.

@strong{Cold-Weather Outfit}: This outfit includes a wool coat, linen shirt, wool cap, heavy cloak, thick pants or skirt, and boots. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on [Fortitude] saving throws against exposure to cold weather.

@strong{Courtier's Outfit}: This outfit includes fancy, tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be the current style in the courts of the nobles. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing street dress will have a hard time of it (--2 penalty on [Charisma]-based skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.

@strong{Entertainer's Outfit}: This set of flashy---perhaps even gaudy---clothes is for entertaining. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design lets you tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or just run (if the audience turns ugly).

@strong{Explorer's Outfit}: This set of clothes is for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra accessories you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.

@strong{Monk's Outfit}: This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can conceal small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.

@strong{Noble's Outfit}: These clothes are designed specifically to be expensive and gaudy. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing. A would-be noble also needs a signet ring and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp) to accessorize this outfit.

@strong{Peasant's Outfit}: This set of clothes consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes.

@strong{Royal Outfit}: This is just the clothing, not the royal scepter, crown, ring, and other accoutrements. Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance.

@strong{Scholar's Outfit}: Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.

@strong{Traveler's Outfit}: This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

@node Food Drink and Lodging
@section Food, Drink, and Lodging
@anchor{#food-drink-and-lodging}
These prices are for meals and accommodations at establishments in an average city.

@strong{Inn}: Poor accommodations at an inn amount to a place on the floor near the hearth. Common accommodations consist of a place on a raised, heated floor and the use of a blanket and a pillow. Good accommodations consist of a small, private room with one bed, some amenities, and a covered chamber pot in the corner.

@strong{Meals}: Poor meals might be composed of bread, baked turnips, onions, and water. Common meals might consist of bread, chicken stew, carrots, and watered-down ale or wine. Good meals might be composed of bread and pastries, beef, peas, and ale or wine.

@node Mounts and Related Gear
@section Mounts and Related Gear
@anchor{#mounts-and-related-gear}
These are the common mounts available in most cities. Some markets might have additional creatures available, such as camels or even griffons, depending on the terrain. Such additional choices are up to GM discretion.

@strong{Barding, Medium Creature and Large Creature}: Barding is a type of armor that covers the head, neck, chest, body, and possibly legs of a horse or other mount. Barding made of medium or heavy armor provides better protection than light barding, but at the expense of speed. Barding can be made of any of the armor types found on Table: Armor and Shields.

Armor for a horse (a Large nonhumanoid creature) costs four times as much as human armor (a Medium humanoid creature) and also weighs twice as much (see Table: Armor for Unusual Creatures). If the barding is for a pony or other Medium mount, the cost is only double, and the weight is the same as for Medium armor worn by a humanoid. Medium or heavy barding slows a mount that wears it, as shown on the table below.

Flying mounts can't fly in medium or heavy barding.

Removing and fitting barding takes five times as long as the figures given on Table: Donning Armor. A barded animal cannot be used to carry any load other than a rider and normal saddlebags.

@strong{Dog, Riding}: This Medium dog is specially trained to carry a Small humanoid rider. It is brave in combat like a war-trained horse. Due to its smaller stature, you take no damage when you fall from a riding dog.

@strong{Donkey or Mule}: Donkeys and mules are stolid in the face of danger, hardy, surefooted, and capable of carrying heavy loads over vast distances. Unlike a horse, a donkey or a mule is willing (though not eager) to enter dungeons and other strange or threatening places.

@strong{Feed}: Horses, donkeys, mules, and ponies can graze to sustain themselves, but providing feed for them is better. If you have a riding dog, you have to feed it meat.

@strong{Horse}: A horse is suitable as a mount for a human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, or half-orc. A pony is smaller than a horse and is a suitable mount for a gnome or halfling.

A war-trained horse can be ridden into combat without danger. See the Handle Animal skill for a list of tricks known by horses and ponies with combat training.

@strong{Saddle, Exotic}: An exotic saddle is designed for an unusual mount. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles.

@strong{Saddle, Military}: This saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If you're knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, you have a 75% chance to stay in the saddle.

@strong{Saddle, Pack}: A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.

@strong{Saddle, Riding}: If you are knocked unconscious while in a riding saddle, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle.

@node Transport
@section Transport
@anchor{#transport}
The prices listed are to purchase the vehicle. These prices generally exclude crew or animals.

@strong{Carriage}: This four-wheeled vehicle can transport as many as four people within an enclosed cab, plus two drivers. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A carriage comes with the harness needed to pull it.

@strong{Cart}: This two-wheeled vehicle can be drawn by a single horse (or other beast of burden). It comes with a harness.

@strong{Galley}: This three-masted ship has 70 oars on either side and requires a total crew of 200. A galley is 130 feet long and 20 feet wide, and can carry 150 tons of cargo or 250 soldiers. For 8,000 gp more, it can be fitted with a ram and castles with firing platforms fore, aft, and amidships. This ship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It moves about 4 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

@strong{Keelboat}: This 50- to 75-foot-long ship is 15 to 20 feet wide and has a few oars to supplement its single mast with a square sail. It has a crew of 8 to 15 and can carry 40 to 50 tons of cargo or 100 soldiers. It can make sea voyages, as well as sail down rivers (thanks to its flat bottom). It moves about 1 mile per hour.

@strong{Longship}: This 75-foot-long ship with 40 oars requires a total crew of 50. It has a single mast and a square sail, and it can carry 50 tons of cargo or 120 soldiers. A longship can make sea voyages. It moves about 3 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

@strong{Rowboat}: This 8- to 12-foot-long boat with two oars holds two or three Medium passengers. It moves about 1-1/2 miles per hour.

@strong{Sailing Ship}: This large, seaworthy ship is 75 to 90 feet long and 20 feet wide, and has a crew of 20. It can carry 150 tons of cargo. It has square sails on its two masts and can make sea voyages. It moves about 2 miles per hour.

@strong{Sled}: This is a wagon on runners for snow and ice travel. In general, two horses (or other beasts of burden) draw it. A sled comes with the harness needed to pull it.

@strong{Wagon}: A four-wheeled, open vehicle for transporting heavy loads. Two horses (or other beasts of burden) must draw it. A wagon comes with the harness needed to pull it.

@strong{Warship}: This 100-foot-long ship has a single mast, although oars can also propel it. It has a crew of 60 to 80 rowers. This ship can carry 160 soldiers, but not for long distances, since there isn't room for supplies to support that many people. The warship cannot make sea voyages and sticks to the coast. It is not used for cargo. It moves about 2-1/2 miles per hour when being rowed or under sail.

@node Spellcasting and Services
@section Spellcasting and Services
@anchor{#spellcasting-and-services}
Sometimes the best solution to a problem is to hire someone else to take care of it.

@strong{Coach Cab}: The price given is for a ride in a coach that transports people (and light cargo) between towns. For a ride in a cab that transports passengers within a city, 1 copper piece usually takes you anywhere you need to go.

@strong{Hireling, Trained}: The amount given is the typical daily wage for mercenary warriors, masons, craftsmen, cooks, scribes, teamsters, and other trained hirelings. This value represents a minimum wage; many such hirelings require significantly higher pay.

@strong{Hireling, Untrained}: The amount shown is the typical daily wage for laborers, maids, and other menial workers.

@strong{Messenger}: This includes horse-riding messengers and runners. Those willing to carry a message to a place they were going anyway may ask for only half the indicated amount.

@strong{Road or Gate Toll}: A toll is sometimes charged to cross a well-kept and well-guarded road to pay for patrols on it and for its upkeep. Occasionally, a large, walled city charges a toll to enter or exit (or sometimes just to enter).

@strong{Ship's Passage}: Most ships do not specialize in passengers, but many have the capability to take a few along when transporting cargo. Double the given cost for creatures larger than Medium or creatures that are otherwise difficult to bring aboard a ship.

@strong{Spellcasting}: The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at his convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell you need to negotiate with him, and the default answer is no.

The cost given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.

Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you aren't returning with the caster.

In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.

@strong{Undeath to Death}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Components}: V, S, M/DF (diamond powder worth 500 gp)

@strong{Area} several undead creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates

This spell functions like @emph{[circle of death]}, except that it destroys undead creatures as noted above.

Undetectable Alignment

@strong{Undetectable Alignment}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 2, paladin 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature or object

@strong{Duration} 24 hours

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

An @emph{undetectable alignment}spell conceals the alignment of an object or a creature from all forms of divination.

Unhallow

@strong{Unhallow}

@strong{School} evocation [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 24 hours

@strong{Components} V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be tied to the @emph{unhallowed}area)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Area} 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

@emph{Unhallow}makes a particular site, building, or structure an unholy site. This has three major effects.

First, the site or structure is guarded by a @emph{[magic circle against good]}effect.

Second, the DC to resist negative channeled energy within the spell's area of effect gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist positive energy is reduced by 4. [Spell resistance] does not apply to this effect. This provision does not apply to the druid version of the spell.

Finally, you may choose to fix a single spell effect to the @emph{unhallowed}site. The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire site, regardless of its normal duration and area or effect. You may designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that share your faith or alignment, or creatures that adhere to another faith or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting @emph{unhallow}again.

Spell effects that may be tied to an @emph{unhallowed}site include @emph{[aid], [bane], [bless], [cause fear], [darkness], [daylight], [death ward], [deeper darkness], [detect magic], [detect good], [dimensional anchor], [discern lies], [dispel magic], [endure elements], [freedom of movement], [invisibility purge], [protection from energy], [remove fear], [resist energy], [silence], [tongues],}and @emph{[zone of truth]}.

Saving throws and [spell resistance] might apply to these spells' effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)

An area can receive only one @emph{unhallow}spell (and its associated spell effect) at a time.

@emph{Unhallow}counters but does not dispel @emph{[hallow]}.

Unholy Aura

@strong{Unholy Aura}

@strong{School} abjuration [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

@strong{Range} 20 ft.

@strong{Targets} one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A malevolent darkness surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by good creatures, and weakening good creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike the effect of @emph{[protection from good]}, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by good creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains SR 25 against good spells and spells cast by good creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the subjects from possession and mental influence, just as @emph{[protection from good]}does.

Finally, if a good creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker takes 1d6 points of [Strength] damage ([Fortitude] negates).

Unholy Blight

@strong{Unholy Blight}

@strong{School} evocation [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration} instantaneous (1d4 rounds); see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be [sickened] for 1d4 rounds. A successful [Will] save reduces damage to half and negates the [sickened] effect. The effects cannot be negated by @emph{[remove disease]}or @emph{[heal],}but @emph{[remove curse]}is effective.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not [sickened]. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful [Will] save.

Unseen Servant

@strong{Unseen Servant}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

An @emph{unseen servant}is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective [Strength] score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.

The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

@strong{Quench}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area or Target} one 20-ft. cube/level (S) or one fire-based magic item

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no or yes (object)

@emph{Quench}is often used to put out forest fires and other conflagrations. It extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. The spell also dispels any fire spells in its area, though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +1 per caster level, maximum +15) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

Each creature with the fire subtype within the area of a @emph{quench}spell takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, no save allowed).

Alternatively, you can target the spell on a single magic item that creates or controls flame@emph{.}The item loses all its fire-based magical abilities for 1d4 hours unless it succeeds on a [Will] save. Artifacts are immune to this effect.

@end itemize

@strong{Obscure Object}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 1, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (chameleon skin)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one object touched of up to 100 lbs./level

@strong{Duration} 8 hours (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell hides an object from location by divination (scrying) effects, such as the @emph{[scrying]}spell or a @emph{crystal ball}. Such an attempt automatically fails (if the divination is targeted on the object) or fails to perceive the object (if the divination is targeted on a nearby location, object, or person).

Obscuring Mist

@strong{Obscuring Mist}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} cleric 1, druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 20 ft.

@strong{Effect} cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including [darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a @emph{[gust of wind]}spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A @emph{[fireball], [flame strike]}, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A @emph{[wall of fire]}burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

Open/Close

@strong{Open/Close}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a brass key)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} object weighing up to 30 lbs. or portal that can be opened or closed

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.

Order's Wrath

@strong{Order's Wrath}

@strong{School} evocation [lawful]; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} nonlawful creatures within a burst that fills a 30-ft. cube

@strong{Duration} instantaneous (1 round); see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You channel lawful power to smite enemies. The power takes the form of a three-dimensional grid of energy. Only chaotic and neutral (not lawful) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to chaotic creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to chaotic outsiders) and causes them to be [dazed] for 1 round. A successful [Will] save reduces the damage to half and negates the daze effect.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not [dazed]. They can reduce the damage in half again (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful [Will] save.

Overland Flight

@strong{Overland Flight}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Components}: V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

This spell functions like a @emph{[fly]}spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on @ref{#fly,Fly} skill checks equal to half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires [Constitution] checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).

Owl's Wisdom

@strong{Owl's Wisdom}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an owl)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Wisdom], adding the usual benefit to [Wisdom]-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other [Wisdom]-based spellcasters) who receive @emph{owl's wisdom}do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Wisdom], but the save DCs for their spells increase.

@strong{Owl's Wisdom, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[owl's wisdom]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

:@strong{Zone of Silence}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Area} 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

By casting @emph{zone of silence}, you manipulate sound waves in your immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a @emph{zone of silence.}

Zone of Truth

@strong{Zone of Truth}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 2, paladin 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}@uref{../combat.html#_will,Will} negates; @strong{@uref{../glossary.html#_spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.

@strong{Passwall}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (sesame seeds)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Effect} 5-ft.-by-8-ft. opening, 10 ft. deep plus 5 ft. deep per three additional levels

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than the depth of the passage created, then a single @emph{passwall}simply makes a niche or short tunnel. Several @emph{passwall}spells can then form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When @emph{passwall}ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the @emph{passwall}or you dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

Pass without Trace

@strong{Pass without Trace}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} one creature/level touched

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject or subjects of this spell do not leave footprints or a [scent] trail while moving. Tracking the subjects is impossible by nonmagical means.

Permanency

@strong{Permanency}

@strong{School} universal; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 2 rounds

@strong{Components} V, S, M (see tables below)

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target}see text

@strong{Duration} permanent; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell makes the duration of certain other spells permanent. You first cast the desired spell and then follow it with the @emph{permanency}spell.

Depending on the spell, you must be of a minimum caster level and must expend a specific gp value of diamond dust as a material component.

You can make the following spells permanent in regard to yourself.

Permanent Image

@strong{Permanent Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Effect} figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} permanent (D)

This spell functions like @emph{[silent image],}except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, and the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating.

Persistent Image

@strong{Persistent Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

This spell functions like @emph{[silent image],}except that the figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.

Phantasmal Killer

@strong{Phantasmal Killer}

@strong{School} illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief, then [Fortitude] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the @emph{phantasmal killer}. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a [Will] save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a [Fortitude] save or die from fear. Even if the [Fortitude] save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

If the subject of a @emph{phantasmal killer}attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a @emph{helm of telepathy,}the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.

Phantom Steed

@strong{Phantom Steed}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} one quasi-real, horselike creature

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount is [AC] 18 (--1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 [Dex]) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

@emph{8th Level}: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

@emph{10th Level}: The mount can use @emph{[water walk]}at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

@emph{12th Level}: The mount can use @emph{[air walk]}at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

@emph{14th Level}: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.

Phantom Trap

@strong{Phantom Trap}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (special dust worth 50 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} object touched

@strong{Duration} permanent (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

If another @emph{phantom trap}is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.

Phase Door

@strong{Phase Door}

@strong{School} conjuration (creation); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Effect} ethereal 5-ft.-by-8-ft. opening, 10 ft. deep + 5 ft. deep per three levels

@strong{Duration} one usage per two levels

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not other materials. The @emph{phase door}is [invisible] and inaccessible to all creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You disappear when you enter the @emph{phase door}and appear when you exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door. The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as phase spiders, can follow with ease. A @emph{gem of [true seeing]}or similar magic reveals the presence of a @emph{phase door}but does not allow its use.

A @emph{phase door}is subject to @emph{[dispel magic].}If anyone is within the passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if he were inside a @emph{[passwall]}effect.

You can allow other creatures to use the @emph{phase door}by setting some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

@emph{Phase door}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Planar Ally

@strong{Planar Ally}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text for @emph{[lesser planar ally]}]; @strong{Level} cleric 6

@strong{Components} V, S, M (offerings worth 1,250 gp plus payment), DF

@strong{Effect} one or two called outsiders, totaling no more than 12 HD, which cannot be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser planar ally]}, except you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or two creatures of the same kind whose HD total no more than 12. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.

@strong{Planar Ally, Greater}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text for @emph{[lesser planar ally]}]; @strong{Level} cleric 8

@strong{Components} V, S, M (offerings worth 2,500 gp plus payment), DF

@strong{Effect} up to three called outsiders, totaling no more than 18 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear.

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser planar ally]}, except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. The creatures agree to help you and request your return payment together.

@strong{Planar Ally, Lesser}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text]; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (offerings worth 500 gp plus payment, see text), DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} one called outsider of 6 HD or less

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).

You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.

The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.

A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.

A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.

At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).

@emph{Note}: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

Planar Binding

@strong{Planar Binding}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text for @emph{[lesser planar binding]}]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Components}: V, S

@strong{Targets} up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 12 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser planar binding],}except that you may call a single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

@strong{Planar Binding, Greater}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text for @emph{[lesser planar binding]}]; @strong{Level}: sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Components}: V, S

@strong{Targets} up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more than 18 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear.

This spell functions like @emph{[lesser planar binding],}except that you may call a single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and must be individually persuaded to aid you.

@strong{Planar Binding, Lesser}

@strong{School} conjuration (calling) [see text]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text

@strong{Target} one elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no and yes; see text

Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.

To create the trap, you must use a @emph{magic circle}spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.

The target creature is allowed a [Will] saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap ([spell resistance] does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its [spell resistance] against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful [Charisma] check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your [Charisma] modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A @emph{[dimensional anchor]}cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see @emph{[magic circle against evil]}) to make the trap more secure.

If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a [Charisma] check opposed by the creature's [Charisma] check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the [Charisma] check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.

Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

Plane Shift

@strong{Plane Shift}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the @emph{[plane shift]}at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. @emph{[Plane shift]}transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting @emph{[plane shift]} again).

Plant Growth

@strong{Plant Growth}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 3, ranger 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target or Area} see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Plant growth}has different effects depending on the version chosen.

@emph{Overgrowth}: This effect causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, and so on) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level) to become thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. The area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take effect. If this spell is cast on an area that is already affected by any spell or effect that enhances plants, such as @emph{[entangle]} or @emph{[wall of thorns],}any DC involved with these spells is increased by 4. This bonus is granted for 1 day after the casting of @emph{plant growth.}

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle.

You may designate places within the area that are not affected.

@emph{Enrichment}: This effect targets plants within a range of a half-mile, raising their potential productivity over the course of the next year to one-third above normal.

@emph{Plant growth}counters @emph{[diminish plants]}.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

Plant Shape

@strong{Plant Shape I}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to assume)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: [darkvision] 60 feet, [low-light vision], constrict, grab, and poison. If the form you assume does not possess the ability to move, your speed is reduced to 5 feet and you lose all other forms of movement. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.

@emph{Small plant}: If the form you take is that of a Small plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Constitution] and a +2 natural armor bonus.

@emph{Medium plant}: If the form you take is that of a Medium plant, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Strength], a +2 enhancement bonus to your [Constitution], and a +2 natural armor bonus.

@strong{Plant Shape II}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as @emph{[plant shape I]} except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large creature of the plant type. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.

@emph{Large plant}: If the form you take is that of a Large plant, you gain a +4 size bonus to your [Strength], a +2 size bonus to your [Constitution], and a +4 natural armor bonus.

@strong{Plant Shape III}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as @emph{[plant shape II]} except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Huge creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: [DR], regeneration 5, and trample.

@emph{Huge plant}: If the form you take is that of a Huge plant, you gain a +8 size bonus to your [Strength], a --2 penalty to your [Dexterity], a +4 size bonus to your [Constitution], and a +6 natural armor bonus.

Poison

@strong{Poison}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 4, druid 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. This poison deals 1d3 [Constitution] damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a [Fortitude] save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.

Polar Ray

@strong{Polar Ray}

@strong{School} evocation [cold]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a white ceramic cone or prism)

@strong{Range} medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 25d6) and 1d4 points of [Dexterity] drain.

Polymorph Any Object

@strong{Polymorph Any Object}

@strong{School} transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (mercury, gum arabic, and smoke)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature, or one nonmagical object of up to 100 cu. ft./level

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (object); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell functions like @emph{[greater polymorph],}except that it changes one object or creature into another. You can use this spell to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new forms---you aren't limited to transforming a living creature into another living form. The duration of the spell depends on how radical a change is made from the original state to its transmuted state. The duration is determined by using the following guidelines.

If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores ([Strength], [Dexterity], or [Constitution]), this spell grants a base score of 10 to each missing ability score. If the target of the spell does not have mental ability scores ([Intelligence], [Wisdom], or [Charisma])@emph{,} this spell grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell.

This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of cold iron in order to overcome the [damage reduction] of certain creatures.

This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of @emph{[baleful polymorph], [greater polymorph], [flesh to stone]}, @emph{[stone to flesh]}, @emph{[transmute mud to rock]}, @emph{[transmute metal to wood],}or @emph{[transmute rock to mud].}

Polymorph

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}living creature touched

@strong{Duration}1 min/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes (harmless)

This spell transforms a willing creature into an animal, humanoid or elemental of your choosing; the spell has no effect on unwilling creatures, nor can the creature being targeted by this spell influence the new form assumed (apart from conveying its wishes, if any, to you verbally).

If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, the spell functions as @emph{[beast shape II]}. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as @emph{[elemental body I].}If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as @emph{[alter self]}. The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject.

@strong{Polymorph, Greater}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as @emph{[polymorph]} except that it allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as @emph{[beast shape IV]}. If the form is that of an elemental, the spell functions as @emph{[elemental body III].}If the form is that of a humanoid, the spell functions as @emph{[alter self]}. If the form is that of a plant, the spell functions as @emph{[plant shape II].}If the form is that of a dragon, the spell functions as @emph{[form of the dragon I].}The subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell.

Power Word Blind

@strong{Power Word Blind}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature with 200 hp or less

@strong{Duration} see text

@strong{Target, Effect, or Area}see text

@strong{Duration} 1 hour

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a @emph{prestidigitation}spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. @emph{Prestidigitation}can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a @emph{prestidigitation}spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, @emph{prestidigitation}lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

Prismatic Sphere

@strong{Prismatic Sphere}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Components}: V

@strong{Range} 10 ft.

@strong{Effect} 10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you

This spell functions like @emph{[prismatic wall],}except you conjure up an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.

The sphere's @emph{blindness}effect on creatures with less than 8 HD lasts 2d4 × 10 minutes.

You can pass into and out of the @emph{prismatic sphere}and remain near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the sphere blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere (including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.

Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually occluded by the floor surface you are standing on.

The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a @emph{[prismatic wall].}

@emph{Prismatic sphere}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes seven shimmering, multicolored beams of light to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power. Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are automatically [blinded] for 2d4 rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, which have additional effects.

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect}wall 4 ft./level wide, 2 ft./level high

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

@emph{Prismatic wall}creates a vertical, opaque wall---a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall is [blinded] by the colors for 2d4 rounds if it looks at the wall.

The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level and 2 feet high per caster level. A @emph{prismatic wall}spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and the spell is wasted.

Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order, by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and so on. A @emph{[rod of cancellation]}or a @emph{[mage's disjunction]}spell destroys a @emph{prismatic wall}, but an @emph{[antimagic field]}fails to penetrate it. @emph{[Dispel magic]}and @emph{greater dispel magic}can only be used on the wall once all the other colors have been destroyed. [Spell resistance] is effective against a @emph{prismatic wall}, but the caster level check must be repeated for each color present.

@emph{Prismatic wall}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Produce Flame

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} flame in your palm

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

This spell does not function underwater.

Programmed Image

@strong{Programmed Image}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Effect} visual figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

@strong{Duration} permanent until triggered, then 1 round/level

This spell functions like @emph{[silent image],}except that this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech.

You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. See @emph{magic mouth}for more details about such triggers.

Project Image

@strong{Project Image}

@strong{School} illusion (shadow); @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Range} medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} one shadow duplicate

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds, and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act differently (which is a move action).

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered [blinded] and [deafened].

If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally, despite originating from the projected image.

Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had succeeded on their [Will] save. You must maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use @emph{[dimension door], [teleport], [plane shift],}or a similar spell that breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

Protection from Arrows

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level or until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains [damage reduction] 10/magic against ranged weapons. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar [damage reduction]. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

Protection from Chaos

@strong{Protection from Chaos}

@strong{School} abjuration [lawful]; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

This spell functions like @emph{[protection from evil]}, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned creatures cannot touch the target.

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level or until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

@emph{Protection from energy}grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.

@emph{Protection from energy}overlaps (and does not stack with) @emph{[resist energy].}If a character is warded by @emph{protection from energy}and @emph{[resist energy],}the @emph{protection}spell absorbs damage until its power is [exhausted].

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no; see text

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects, such as @emph{charm person}, @emph{command}, and @emph{dominate person}. This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using @emph{[magic]}[]@emph{[jar]}), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. [Spell resistance] can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

Protection from Good

@strong{Protection from Good}

@strong{School} abjuration [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

This spell functions like @emph{[protection from evil]}, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by good creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by good creatures and good summoned creatures cannot touch the target.

Protection from Law

@strong{Protection from Law}

@strong{School} abjuration [chaotic]; @strong{Level} cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

This spell functions like @emph{[protection from evil]}, except that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made by lawful creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against control by lawful creatures and lawful summoned creatures cannot touch the target.

@strong{Components} V, S, M (diamond worth 500 gp), F (One 1,000 gp diamond per target. Each subject must carry the gem for the duration of the spell. If a subject loses the gem, the spell ceases to affect him.)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} up to one creature touched per four levels

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject gains a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities (but not against supernatural and extraordinary abilities).

Prying Eyes

@strong{Prying Eyes}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a handful of crystal marbles)

@strong{Range} 1 mile

@strong{Effect} 10 or more levitating eyes

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level; see text (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.

While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, [AC] 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus on Fly skill checks and a +16 bonus on Stealth skill checks. It has a Perception modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch.

When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.

In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.

If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.

The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. @emph{[Dispel magic]}can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

@strong{Prying Eyes, Greater}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions like @emph{[prying eyes],}except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had @emph{[true seeing]}with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at normal speed. Also, a @emph{greater prying eye}'s maximum Perception modifier is +25 instead of +15.

Purify Food and Drink

@strong{Target} 1 cu. ft./level of contaminated food and water

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by @emph{purify food and drink,}but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic potions. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

Pyrotechnics

@strong{Pyrotechnics}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (one fire source)

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube

@strong{Duration} 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave the smoke cloud; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates or [Fortitude] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes or no; see text

@emph{Pyrotechnics}turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

@emph{Fireworks}: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become [blinded] for 1d4+1 rounds ([Will] negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. [Spell resistance] can prevent blindness.

@emph{Smoke Cloud}: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even [darkvision], is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take --4 penalties to [Strength] and [Dexterity] ([Fortitude] negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. [Spell resistance] does not apply.

@strong{Keen Edge}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one weapon or 50 projectiles, all of which must be together at the time of casting

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19--20, a threat range of 19--20 becomes 17--20, and a threat range of 18--20 becomes 15--20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the @emph{keen edge}on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as the @emph{keen}special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

Knock

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Target} one door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq. ft./level

@strong{Duration} instantaneous; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

K@emph{nock}opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those subject to @emph{[hold portal]}or @emph{[arcane lock]}. When you complete the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, @emph{knock}opens up to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something shut). If used to open an @emph{[arcane lock]ed}door, the spell does not remove the @emph{[arcane lock]}but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own. @emph{Knock}does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of north from your current position. The spell is effective in any environment in which “north” exists, but it may not work in extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if you don't find some external reference point to help you keep track of direction.

@strong{Neutralize Poison}

@strong{Duration}instantaneous or 10 min./level; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}yes (harmless, object)

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster's option. If cast on a creature, the creature receives a [Will] save to negate the effect.

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.

The @emph{nightmare}prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The @emph{nightmare}leaves the subject [fatigued] and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours.

The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject and the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

Each level, your character gains a number of skill ranks dependent upon your class plus your [Intelligence] modifier. Investing a rank in a skill represents a measure of training in that skill. You can never have more ranks in a skill than your total number of Hit Dice. In addition, each class has a number of favored skills, called class skills. It is easier for your character to become more proficient in these skills, as they represent part of his professional training and constant practice. You gain a +3 bonus on all class skills that you put ranks into. If you have more than one class and both grant you a class skill bonus, these bonuses do not stack.

@section Skill Checks
@anchor{#skill-checks}
When your character uses a skill, he isn't guaranteed success. In order to determine success, whenever you attempt to use a skill, you must make a skill check.

Each skill rank grants a +1 bonus on checks made using that skill. When you make a skill check, you roll 1d20 and then add your ranks and the appropriate ability score modifier to the result of this check. If the skill you're using is a class skill (and you have invested ranks into that skill), you gain a +3 bonus on the check. If you are not trained in the skill (and if the skill may be used untrained), you may still attempt the skill, but you use only the bonus (or penalty) provided by the associated ability score modifier to modify the check. Skills can be further modified by a wide variety of sources---by your race, by a class ability, by equipment, by spell effects or magic items, and so on. See Table: Skill Check Bonuses for a summary of skill check bonuses.

* Armor check penalty applies to all [Strength]- and [Dexterity]-based skill checks.

If the result of your skill check is equal to or greater than the difficulty class (or DC) of the task you are attempting to accomplish, you succeed. If it is less than the DC, you fail. Some tasks have varying levels of success and failure depending on how much your check is above or below the required DC. Some skill checks are opposed by the target's skill check. When making an opposed skill check, the attempt is successful if your check result exceeds the result of the target.

@node Taking 10 and Taking 20
@section Taking 10 and Taking 20
@anchor{#taking-10-and-taking-20}
A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions, increasing the odds of success.

@strong{Taking 10}: When your character is not in immediate danger or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure---you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn't help.

@strong{Taking 20}: When you have plenty of time, you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, if you a d20 roll enough times, eventually you will get a 20. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.

Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes 20 times as long as making a single check would take (usually 2 minutes for a skill that takes 1 round or less to perform).

Since taking 20 assumes that your character will fail many times before succeeding, your character would automatically incur any penalties for failure before he or she could complete the task (hence why it is generally not allowed with skills that carry such penalties). Common “take 20” skills include Disable Device (when used to open locks), Escape Artist, and Perception (when attempting to find traps).

@strong{Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks}: The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to concentration checks or caster level checks.

@node Aid Another
@section Aid Another
@anchor{#aid-another-1}
You can help someone achieve success on a skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you're helping gets a +2 bonus on his or her check. (You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.

In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results, such as trying to open a lock using Disable Device, you can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn't achieve alone. The GM might impose further restrictions to aiding another on a case-by-case basis as well.

You can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also dive, flip, jump, and roll to avoid attacks and overcome obstacles.

@strong{Check}: You can use Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces---only one check is needed per round. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is then modified by the Acrobatics skill modifiers noted below. While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you are considered flat-footed and lose your [Dexterity] bonus to your [AC] (if any). If you take damage while using Acrobatics, you must immediately make another Acrobatics check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.

* No Acrobatics check is needed to move across these surfaces unless the modifiers to the surface (below) increase the DC to 10 or higher.

In addition, you can move through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy by using Acrobatics. When moving in this way, you move at half speed. You can move at full speed by increasing the DC of the check by 10. You cannot use Acrobatics to move past foes if your speed is reduced due to carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor. If an ability allows you to move at full speed under such conditions, you can use Acrobatics to move past foes. You can use Acrobatics in this way while prone, but doing so requires a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC is increased by 5. If you attempt to move though an enemy's space and fail the check, you lose the move action and provoke an attack of opportunity.

Finally, you can use the Acrobatics skill to make jumps or to soften a fall. The base DC to make a jump is equal to the distance to be crossed (if horizontal) or four times the height to be reached (if vertical). These DCs double if you do not have at least 10 feet of space to get a running start. The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from. If you fail this check by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 [Reflex] save to grab hold of the other side after having missed the jump. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to make the jump and fall (or land prone, in the case of a vertical jump). Creatures with a base land speed above 30 feet receive a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed above 30 feet. Creatures with a base land speed below 30 feet receive a --4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed below 30 feet. No jump can allow you to exceed your maximum movement for the round. For a running jump, the result of your Acrobatics check indicates the distance traveled in the jump (and if the check fails, the distance at which you actually land and fall prone). Halve this result for a standing long jump to determine where you land.

When you deliberately fall any distance, even as a result of a missed jump, a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall. See the [falling rules] for further details.

Many conditions can affect your chances of success with Acrobatics checks. The following modifiers to target DCs apply to all Acrobatics skill checks. The modifiers stack with one another, but only the most severe modifier for any one condition applies.

* This does not apply to checks made to jump.

@strong{Action}: None. An Acrobatics check is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

@strong{Special}: If you have 3 or more ranks in Acrobatics, you gain a +3 [dodge bonus] to [AC] when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2, and a +6 [dodge bonus] to [AC] when taking the total defense action instead of the usual +4.

If you have the @ref{#acrobatic,Acrobatic} feat, you get a bonus on Acrobatics checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You can evaluate the monetary value of an object.

@strong{Check}: A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item's abilities. If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items might increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.

You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.

@strong{Action}: Appraising an item takes 1 standard action. Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.

@strong{Try Again}: Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.

@strong{Special}: A spellcaster with a raven familiar gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.

You know how to tell a lie.

@strong{Check}: Bluff is an opposed skill check against your opponent's Sense Motive skill. If you use Bluff to fool someone, with a successful check you convince your opponent that what you are saying is true. Bluff checks are modified depending upon the believability of the lie. The following modifiers are applied to the roll of the creature attempting to tell the lie. Note that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince anyone that they are true (subject to GM discretion).

@emph{Feint}: You can use Bluff to feint in combat, causing your opponent to be denied his [Dexterity] bonus to his [AC] against your next attack. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent's base attack bonus + your opponent's [Wisdom] modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent's Sense Motive bonus, if higher. For more information on feinting in combat, see [Combat].

@emph{Secret Messages}: You can use Bluff to pass hidden messages along to another character without others understanding your true meaning by using innuendo to cloak your actual message. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for complex messages. If you are successful, the target automatically understands you, assuming you are communicating in a language that it understands. If your check fails by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures that receive the message can decipher it by succeeding at an opposed Sense Motive check against your Bluff result.

@strong{Action}: Attempting to deceive someone takes at least 1 round, but can possibly take longer if the lie is elaborate (as determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis).

Feinting in combat is a standard action.

Using Bluff to deliver a secret message takes twice as long as the message would otherwise take to relay.

@strong{Try Again}: If you fail to deceive someone, further attempts to deceive them are at a --10 penalty and may be impossible (GM discretion).

You can attempt to feint against someone again if you fail. Secret messages can be relayed again if the first attempt fails.

@strong{Special}: A spellcaster with a viper familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.

If you have the @ref{#deceitful,Deceitful} feat, you get a bonus on Bluff checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at scaling vertical surfaces, from smooth city walls to rocky cliffs.

@strong{Check}: With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, wall, or other steep incline (or even across a ceiling, provided it has handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.

A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.

Climb DC

Example Surface or Activity

0

A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against.

5

A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the @emph{rope trick}spell.

10

A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship's rigging.

15

Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands.

20

An uneven surface with narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon.

25

A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall.

30

An overhang or ceiling with handholds only.

---

A perfectly smooth, flat vertical (or inverted) surface cannot be climbed.

Climb DC Modifier*

Example Surface or Activity

--10

Climbing a chimney (artificial or natural) or other location where you can brace against two opposite walls.

--5

Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls.

+5

Surface is slippery.

* These modifiers are cumulative; use all that apply.

You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing. Anytime you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.

@emph{Accelerated Climbing}: You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a --5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).

@emph{Make Your Own Handholds and Footholds}: You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 5 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.

@emph{Catch Yourself When Falling}: It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling, yet if you wish to attempt such a difficult task, you can make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).

@emph{Catch a Falling Character While Climbing}: If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's fall and begin falling as well.

@strong{Action}: Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an action.

@strong{Special}: You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.

A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a --5 penalty. Such a creature retains its [Dexterity] bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

If you have the @ref{#athletic,Athletic} feat, you get a bonus on Climb checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

Craft

You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.

A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.

@strong{Check}: You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)

The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item's finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.

In some cases, the @emph{fabricate}spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the @emph{ironwood}spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.

When casting the spell @emph{minor creation}, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.

All crafts require artisan's tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a --2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan's tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.

​1. Find the item's price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).

​2. Find the item's DC from Table: Craft Skills.

​3. Pay 1/3 of the item's price for the raw material cost.

​4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week's worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you've completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn't equal the price, then it represents the progress you've made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.

If you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

@emph{Progress by the Day}: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.

@emph{Create Masterwork Items}: You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see [Equipment] for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.

@emph{Repair Items}: You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item's price.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes, but each time you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.

@strong{Special}: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you'll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.

To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist's lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.

A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of her choice.

You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem.

@strong{Check}: You can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters with a successful check. The DC of this check depends on the creature's starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its [Charisma] modifier. If you succeed, the character's attitude toward you is improved by one step. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character's attitude toward you increases by one additional step. A creature's attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the character's attitude toward you is unchanged. If you fail by 5 or more, the character's attitude toward you is decreased by one step.

You cannot use Diplomacy against a creature that does not understand you or has an [Intelligence] of 3 or less. Diplomacy is generally ineffective in combat and against creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future. Any attitude shift caused through Diplomacy generally lasts for 1d4 hours but can last much longer or shorter depending upon the situation (GM discretion).

If a creature's attitude toward you is at least indifferent, you can make requests of the creature. This is an additional Diplomacy check, using the creature's current attitude to determine the base DC, with one of the following modifiers. Once a creature's attitude has shifted to helpful, the creature gives in to most requests without a check, unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril. Some requests automatically fail if the request goes against the creature's values or its nature, subject to GM discretion.

@emph{Gather Information}: You can also use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual. To do this, you must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places. The DC of this check depends on the obscurity of the information sought, but for most commonly known facts or rumors it is 10. For obscure or secret knowledge, the DC might increase to 20 or higher. The GM might rule that some topics are simply unknown to common folk.

@strong{Action}: Using Diplomacy to influence a creature's attitude takes 1 minute of continuous interaction. Making a request of a creature takes 1 or more rounds of interaction, depending upon the complexity of the request. Using Diplomacy to gather information takes 1d4 hours of work searching for rumors and informants.

@strong{Try Again}: You cannot use Diplomacy to influence a given creature's attitude more than once in a 24-hour period. If a request is refused, the result does not change with additional checks, although other requests might be made. You can retry Diplomacy checks made to gather information.

@strong{Special}: If you have the @ref{#persuasive,Persuasive} feat, you gain a bonus on Diplomacy checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.

@strong{Check}: When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded.

The DC depends on how tricky the device is. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you trigger it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

* If you attempt to leave behind no trace of your tampering, add 5 to the DC.

@* Lock Quality Disable Device DC -------------- ------------------- Simple 20 Average 25 Good 30 Superior 40

@emph{Open Locks}: The DC for opening a lock depends on its quality. If you do not have a set of thieves' tools, these DCs increase by 10.

@strong{Action}: The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. A tricky or difficult device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a full-round action.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less. You can retry checks made to open locks.

@strong{Special}: If you have the @ref{#deft-hands,Deft Hands} feat, you get a bonus on Disable Device checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it without disarming it. A rogue can rig a trap so her allies can bypass it as well.

@strong{Restriction}: Characters with the trapfinding ability (like rogues) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

The spells @emph{fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol,}and @emph{teleportation circle}also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. @emph{Spike growth}and @emph{spike stones,}however, create magic hazards against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

You are skilled at changing your appearance.

@strong{Check}: Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Perception check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.

You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people make Perception checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is.

The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you're changing your appearance. Disguise can be used to make yourself appear like a creature that is one size category larger or smaller than your actual size. This does not change your actual size or reach, should you enter combat while wearing such a disguise.

@* Familiarity Viewer's Perception Check Bonus ----------------------- --------------------------------- Recognizes on sight +4 Friends or associates +6 Close friends +8 Intimate +10

If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Perception checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.

An individual makes a Perception check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and again every hour thereafter. If you casually meet a large number of different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Perception modifier for the group.

@strong{Action}: Creating a disguise requires 1d3 × 10 minutes of work. Using magic (such as the @emph{disguise self} spell) reduces this action to the time required to cast the spell or trigger the effect.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they'll be more suspicious.

@strong{Special}: Magic that alters your form, such as @emph{alter self, disguise self, polymorph}, or @emph{shapechange,}grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as @emph{true seeing}) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.

You must make a Disguise check when you cast a @emph{simulacrum}spell to determine how good the likeness is.

If you have the @ref{#deceitful,Deceitful} feat, you gain a bonus on Disguise checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

Your training allows you to slip out of bonds and escape from grapples.

@strong{Check}: The table below gives the DCs needed to escape various forms of restraints.

@emph{Ropes}: The DC of your Escape Artist check is equal to the binder's Combat Maneuver Bonus +20.

@emph{Manacles and Masterwork Manacles}: The DC for manacles is set by their construction (see the table below).

@emph{Tight Space}: The DC noted is for getting through a space through which your head fits but your shoulders don't. If the space is long, you may need to make multiple checks. You can't squeeze through a space that your head does not fit through.

@emph{Grappler}: You can make an Escape Artist check in place of a combat maneuver check to escape a grapple (see [Combat]) or a pin.

Escaping from a net or an @emph{animate rope, command plants, control plants,}or @emph{entangle}spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. You can make another check after a failed check if you're squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you're not being actively opposed. If the DC to escape from rope or bindings is higher than 20 + your Escape Artist skill bonus, you cannot escape from the bonds using Escape Artist.

@strong{Special}: If you have the @ref{#stealthy,Stealthy} feat, you gain a bonus on Escape Artist checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at flying, through either the use of wings or magic, and can perform daring or complex maneuvers while airborne. Note that this skill does not give you the ability to fly.

@strong{Check}: You generally need only make a Fly check when you are attempting a complex maneuver. Without making a check, a flying creature can remain flying at the end of its turn so long as it moves a distance greater than half its speed. It can also turn up to 45 degrees by sacrificing 5 feet of movement, can rise at half speed at an angle of 45 degrees, and can descend at any angle at normal speed. Note that these restrictions only apply to movement taken during your current turn. At the beginning of the next turn, you can move in a different direction than you did the previous turn without making a check. Taking any action that violates these rules requires a Fly check. The difficulty of these maneuvers varies depending upon the maneuver you are attempting, as noted on the following chart.

@emph{Attacked While Flying}: You are not considered flat-footed while flying. If you are flying using wings and you take damage while flying, you must make a DC 10 Fly check to avoid losing 10 feet of altitude. This descent does not provoke an attack of opportunity and does not count against a creature's movement.

@emph{Collision While Flying}: If you are using wings to fly and you collide with an object equal to your size or larger, you must immediately make a DC 25 Fly check to avoid plummeting to the ground, taking the appropriate falling damage.

@emph{Avoid Falling Damage}: If you are falling and have the ability to fly, you can make a DC 10 Fly check to negate the damage. You cannot make this check if you are falling due to a failed Fly check or a collision.

@emph{High Wind Speeds}: Flying in high winds adds penalties on your Fly checks as noted on Table: Wind Effects on Flight. “Checked” means that creatures of that size or smaller must succeed on a DC 20 Fly check to move at all so long as the wind persists. “Blown away” means that creatures of that size or smaller must make a DC 25 Fly check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. This check must be made every round the creature remains airborne. A creature that is blown away must still make a DC 20 Fly check to move due to also being checked.

@strong{Action}: None. A Fly check doesn't require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. You can attempt a Fly check to perform the same maneuver on subsequent rounds. If you are using wings and you fail a Fly check by 5 or more, you plummet to the ground, taking the appropriate falling damage (see [Environment]).

@strong{Special}: A spellcaster with a bat familiar gains a +3 bonus on Fly checks.

Creatures with a fly speed treat the Fly skill as a class skill. A creature with a natural fly speed receives a bonus (or penalty) on Fly skill checks depending on its maneuverability: Clumsy --8, Poor --4, Average +0, Good +4, Perfect +8. Creatures without a listed maneuverability rating are assumed to have average maneuverability.

A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Fly checks depending on its size category: Fine +8, Diminutive +6, Tiny +4, Small +2, Large --2, Huge --4, Gargantuan --6, Colossal --8.

You cannot take ranks in this skill without a natural means of flight or gliding. Creatures can also take ranks in Fly if they possess a reliable means of flying every day (either through a spell or other special ability).

If you have the @ref{#acrobatic,Acrobatic} feat, you get a bonus on Fly checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

* See the specific trick or purpose below.

@emph{Handle an Animal}: This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

“@emph{Push” an Animal}: To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn't know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.

@emph{Teach an Animal a Trick}: You can teach an animal a specific trick with 1 week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an [Intelligence] score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an [Intelligence] score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.

@itemize
@item
Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.
@item
Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.
@item
Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend another specific character.
@item
Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn't know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.
@item
Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object.
@item
Guard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.
@item
Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn't go.
@item
Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.
@item
Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.
@item
Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.
@item
Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability.)
@item
Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.
@end itemize

@emph{Train an Animal for a General Purpose}: Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal's purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an [Intelligence] score of 2 or higher.

An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.

@itemize
@item
Combat Training (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes 6 weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat by spending 3 weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal's previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Many horses and riding dogs are trained in this way.
@item
Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes 3 weeks.
@item
Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes 4 weeks.
@item
Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes 2 weeks.
@item
Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes 6 weeks.
@item
Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes 5 weeks.
@item
Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes 3 weeks.
@end itemize

@emph{Rear a Wild Animal}: To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.

A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it's being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.

@strong{Action}: Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while “pushing” an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle an animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes, except for rearing an animal.

@strong{Special}: You can use this skill on a creature with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.

A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving an animal companion.

In addition, a druid's or ranger's animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don't count against the normal limit on tricks known and don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.

If you have the @ref{#animal-affinity,Animal Affinity} feat, you get a bonus on Handle Animal checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

@strong{Untrained}: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a [Charisma] check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can't teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a [Charisma] check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can't teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.

@emph{First Aid}: You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed (see @ref{#conditions,Conditions} for rules on bleed damage).

@emph{Long-Term Care}: Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.

You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

@emph{Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones}: A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.

A creature wounded by a @emph{spike growth} or @emph{spike stones} spell must succeed on a [Reflex] save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.

@emph{Treat Deadly Wounds}: When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your [Wisdom] modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a healer's kit to perform this task. You take a --2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer's kit that you lack.

@emph{Treat Poison}: To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.

@emph{Treat Disease}: To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.

@strong{Action}: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a @emph{spike growth} or @emph{spike stones} spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.

@strong{Special}: A character with the @ref{#self-sufficient,Self-Sufficient} feat gets a bonus on Heal checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.

You can use this skill to frighten an opponent or to get them to act in a way that benefits you. This skill includes verbal threats and displays of prowess.

@strong{Check}: You can use Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward you for 1d6 × 10 minutes with a successful check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's [Wisdom] modifier. If successful, the target gives you the information you desire, takes actions that do not endanger it, or otherwise offers limited assistance. After the Intimidate expires, the target treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities.

@emph{Demoralize}: You can use this skill to cause an opponent to become shaken for a number of rounds. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's [Wisdom] modifier. If you are successful, the target is shaken for 1 round. This duration increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten an opponent in this way if they are within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. Using demoralize on the same creature only extends the duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition.

@strong{Action}: Using Intimidate to change an opponent's attitude requires 1 minute of conversation. Demoralizing an opponent is a standard action.

@strong{Try Again}: You can attempt to Intimidate an opponent again, but each additional check increases the DC by +5. This increase resets after 1 hour has passed.

@strong{Special}: You also gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks if you are larger than your target and a --4 penalty on Intimidate checks if you are smaller than your target.

If you have the @ref{#persuasive,Persuasive} feat, you get a bonus on Intimidate checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

A half-orc gets a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.

@strong{Check}: Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster's CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster's CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster's CR, or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information. Many of the Knowledge skills have specific uses as noted on Table: Knowledge Skill DCs.

@strong{Action}: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn't take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).

@strong{Try Again}: No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you never learned in the first place.

@strong{Untrained}: You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10. If you have access to an extensive library that covers a specific skill, this limit is removed. The time to make checks using a library, however, increases to 1d4 hours. Particularly complete libraries might even grant a bonus on Knowledge checks in the fields that they cover.

You are skilled at working with language, in both its spoken and written forms. You can speak multiple languages, and can decipher nearly any tongue given enough time. Your skill in writing allows you to create and detect forgeries as well.

@strong{Check}: You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 [Wisdom] check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)

Both the Linguistics check and (if necessary) the [Wisdom] check are made secretly by the GM, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.

@emph{Create or Detect Forgeries}: Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed.

The Linguistics check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don't make a check until someone examines the work. Your Linguistics check is opposed by the Linguistics check of the person who examines the document to verify its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers if any of the conditions are listed on the table above.

@emph{Learn a Language}: Whenever you put a rank into this skill, you learn to speak and read a new language. Common languages (and their typical speakers) include the following.

@strong{Action}: Varies. Deciphering a page of ordinary text takes 1 minute (10 consecutive rounds). Creating a forgery can take anywhere from 1 minute to 1d4 minutes per page. Detecting a forgery using Linguistics takes 1 round of examination per page.

Your senses allow you to notice fine details and alert you to danger. Perception covers all five senses, including sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.

@strong{Check}: Perception has a number of uses, the most common of which is an opposed check versus an opponent's Stealth check to notice the opponent and avoid being surprised. If you are successful, you notice the opponent and can react accordingly. If you fail, your opponent can take a variety of actions, including sneaking past you and attacking you.

Perception is also used to notice fine details in the environment. The DC to notice such details varies depending upon distance, the environment, and how noticeable the detail is. The following table gives a number of guidelines.

1 Favorable and unfavorable conditions depend upon the sense being used to make the check. For example, bright light might decrease the DC of checks involving sight, while torchlight or moonlight might increase the DC. Background noise might increase a DC involving hearing, while competing odors might increase the DC of a check involving scent.

2 As for unfavorable conditions, but more extreme. For example, candlelight for DCs involving sight, a roaring dragon for DCs involving hearing, and an overpowering stench covering the area for DCs involving scent.

@strong{Action}: Most Perception checks are reactive, made in response to observable stimulus. Intentionally searching for stimulus is a move action.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes. You can try to sense something you missed the first time, so long as the stimulus is still present.

@strong{Special}: Elves, half-elves, gnomes, and halflings receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Creatures with the scent special quality have a +8 bonus on Perception checks made to detect a scent. Creatures with the tremorsense special quality have a +8 bonus on Perception checks against creatures touching the ground and automatically make any such checks within their range. For more on special qualities, see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities}.

A spellcaster with a hawk or owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Perception checks. If you have the @ref{#alertness,Alertness} feat, you get a bonus on Perception checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

@strong{Try Again}: Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)

While a Craft skill represents ability in creating an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge. The most common Profession skills are architect, baker, barrister, brewer, butcher, clerk, cook, courtesan, driver, engineer, farmer, fisherman, gambler, gardener, herbalist, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, midwife, miller, miner, porter, sailor, scribe, shepherd, stable master, soldier, tanner, trapper, and woodcutter.

@strong{Check}: You can earn half your Profession check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the profession's daily tasks, how to supervise helpers, and how to handle common problems. You can also answer questions about your Profession. Basic questions are DC 10, while more complex questions are DC 15 or higher.

@strong{Action}: Not applicable. A single check generally represents a week of work.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. An attempt to use a Profession skill to earn income cannot be retried. You are stuck with whatever weekly wage your check result brought you. Another check may be made after a week to determine a new income for the next period of time. An attempt to accomplish some specific task can usually be retried.

@emph{Guide with Knees}: You can guide your mount with your knees so you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount. This does not take an action.

@emph{Stay in Saddle}: You can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage. This usage does not take an action.

@emph{Fight with a Combat-Trained Mount}: If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle, you can still make your own attack or attacks normally. This usage is a free action.

@emph{Cover}: You can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can't attack or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you fail your Ride check, you don't get the cover benefit. Using this option is an immediate action, but recovering from this position is a move action (no check required).

@emph{Soft Fall}: You negate damage when you fall off a mount. If you fail the Ride check, you take 1d6 points of damage and are prone. This usage does not take an action.

@emph{Leap}: You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. If the Ride check to make the leap succeeds, make a check using your Ride modifier or the mount's jump modifier, which is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action but is part of the mount's movement.

@emph{Spur Mount}: You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount's speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1d3 points of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but the mount becomes fatigued after a number of rounds equal to its [Constitution] score. This ability cannot be used on a fatigued mount.

@emph{Control Mount in Battle}: As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for horses or ponies trained for combat.

@emph{Fast Mount or Dismount}: You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can't use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.

@strong{Action}: Varies. Mounting or dismounting normally is a move action. Other checks are a move action, a free action, or no action at all, as noted above.

@strong{Special}: If you are riding bareback, you take a --5 penalty on Ride checks.

If you have the @ref{#animal-affinity,Animal Affinity} feat, you get a bonus on Ride checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

If you use a military saddle you get a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle.

Ride is a prerequisite for [Mounted Archery], @ref{#mounted-combat,Mounted Combat}, [Ride-By Attack], [Spirited Charge], and [Trample].

You are skilled at detecting falsehoods and true intentions.

@strong{Check}: A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). You can also use this skill to determine when “something is up” (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness.

@emph{Hunch}: This use of the skill involves making a gut assessment of the social situation. You can get the feeling from another's behavior that something is wrong, such as when you're talking to an impostor. Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

@emph{Sense Enchantment}: You can tell that someone's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect even if that person isn't aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see @emph{dominate person}), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target's activities.

@emph{Discern Secret Message}: You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a --2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can't learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you might infer false information.

@strong{Action}: Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.

@strong{Try Again}: No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.

@strong{Special}: A ranger gains a bonus on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.

If you have the @ref{#alertness,Alertness} feat, you get a bonus on Sense Motive checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

Your training allows you to pick pockets, draw hidden weapons, and take a variety of actions without being noticed.

@strong{Check}: A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went.

When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's Perception check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.

You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone observing you or of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Perception check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.

Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

If you try to take something from a creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. The opponent makes a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item. You cannot use this skill to take an object from another creature during combat if the creature is aware of your presence.

@strong{Action}: Any Sleight of Hand check is normally a standard action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a move action by taking a --20 penalty on the check.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes, but after an initial failure, a second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for the task by 10.

@strong{Untrained}: An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a [Dexterity] check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.

@strong{Special}: If you have the @ref{#deft-hands,Deft Hands} feat, you get a bonus on Sleight of Hand checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at the art of casting spells, identifying magic items, crafting magic items, and identifying spells as they are being cast.

@strong{Check}: Spellcraft is used whenever your knowledge and skill of the technical art of casting a spell or crafting a magic item comes into question. This skill is also used to identify the properties of magic items in your possession through the use of spells such as @emph{detect magic} and @emph{identify.}The DC of this check varies depending upon the task at hand.

@strong{Action}: Identifying a spell as it is being cast requires no action, but you must be able to clearly see the spell as it is being cast, and this incurs the same penalties as a Perception skill check due to distance, poor conditions, and other factors. Learning a spell from a spellbook takes 1 hour per level of the spell (0-level spells take 30 minutes). Preparing a spell from a borrowed spellbook does not add any time to your spell preparation. Making a Spellcraft check to craft a magic item is made as part of the creation process. Attempting to ascertain the properties of a magic item takes 3 rounds per item to be identified and you must be able to thoroughly examine the object.

@strong{Retry}: You cannot retry checks made to identify a spell. If you fail to learn a spell from a spellbook or scroll, you must wait at least 1 week before you can try again. If you fail to prepare a spell from a borrowed spellbook, you cannot try again until the next day. When using @emph{detect magic}or @emph{identify} to learn the properties of magic items, you can only attempt to ascertain the properties of an individual item once per day. Additional attempts reveal the same results.

@strong{Special}: If you are a specialist wizard, you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify, learn, and prepare spells from your chosen school. Similarly, you take a --5 penalty on similar checks made concerning spells from your opposition schools.

An elf gets a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify the properties of magic items.

If you have the @ref{#magical-aptitude,Magical Aptitude} feat, you gain a bonus on Spellcraft checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at avoiding detection, allowing you to slip past foes or strike from an unseen position. This skill covers hiding and moving silently.

@strong{Check}: Your Stealth check is opposed by the Perception check of anyone who might notice you. You can move up to half your normal speed and use Stealth at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than half but less than your normal speed, you take a --5 penalty. It's impossible to use Stealth while attacking, running, or charging.

A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Stealth checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large --4, Huge --8, Gargantuan --12, Colossal --16.

If people are observing you using any of their senses (but typically sight), you can't use Stealth. Against most creatures, finding cover or concealment allows you to use Stealth. If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check), you can attempt to use Stealth. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Stealth check if you can get to an unobserved place of some kind. This check, however, is made at a --10 penalty because you have to move fast.

@emph{Sniping}: If you've already successfully used Stealth at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack and then immediately use Stealth again. You take a --20 penalty on your Stealth check to maintain your obscured location.

@emph{Creating a Diversion to Hide}: You can use Bluff to allow you to use Stealth. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.

@strong{Action}: Usually none. Normally, you make a Stealth check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, using Stealth immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.

@strong{Special}: If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Stealth checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if you're moving.

If you have the @ref{#stealthy,Stealthy} feat, you get a bonus on Stealth checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

@end multitable

@emph{Follow Tracks}: To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow. If you are not trained in this skill, you can make untrained checks to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the Perception skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage using the same DCs, but you can't use Perception to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.

You move at half your normal speed while following tracks (or at your normal speed with a --5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a --20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table.

@emph{Soft Ground}: Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.

@emph{Firm Ground}: Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.

@emph{Hard Ground}: Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).

2 Apply only the largest modifier from this category.

Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table above.

@strong{Action}: Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.

@strong{Try Again}: Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the [Fortitude] save bonus noted in the first table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

@strong{Special}: If you are trained in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.

A ranger gains a bonus on Survival checks when using this skill to find or follow the tracks of a favored enemy.

You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.

@strong{Check}: Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.

If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your [Constitution] score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the [Constitution] check, you begin to drown. The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.

* You can't take 10 on a Swim check in stormy water, even if you aren't otherwise being threatened or distracted.

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

@strong{Action}: A successful Swim check allows you to swim a quarter of your speed as a move action or half your speed as a full-round action.

@strong{Special}: A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.

If you have the @ref{#athletic,Athletic} feat, you get a bonus on Swim checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

You are skilled at activating magic items, even if you are not otherwise trained in their use.

@strong{Check}: You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.

You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.

You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.

@emph{Activate Blindly}: Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but doesn't do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally risk when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.

@emph{Decipher a Written Spell}: This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.

@emph{Emulate an Ability Score}: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability ([Intelligence] for wizard spells, [Wisdom] for divine spells, or [Charisma] for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make this check.

@emph{Emulate an Alignment}: Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.

@emph{Emulate a Class Feature}: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).

@emph{Emulate a Race}: Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a member of a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.

@emph{Use a Scroll}: Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check.

This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.

@emph{Use a Wand, Staff, or Other Spell Trigger Item}: Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. Failing the roll does not expend a charge.

@strong{Action}: None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.

@strong{Try Again}: Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate that item again for 24 hours.

@strong{Special}: You cannot take 10 with this skill. You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.

If you have the @ref{#magical-aptitude,Magical Aptitude} feat, you gain a bonus on Use Magic Device checks (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

@strong{Vampiric touch}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous/1 hour; see text

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's [Constitution] score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later.

@strong{Targets} one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} concentration + 1 hour/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes; see text

You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check.

Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making [Will] saves or with [spell resistance]. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt [Will] disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but [spell resistance] doesn't help.

Ventriloquism

@strong{Ventriloquism}

@strong{School} illusion (figment); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, F (parchment rolled into cone)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} intelligible sound, usually speech

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from someplace else. You can speak in any language you know. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone who hears the sound and rolls a successful save recognizes it as illusory (but still hears it).

Virtue

@strong{Virtue}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min.

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

With a touch, you infuse a creature with a tiny surge of life, granting the subject 1 temporary hit point.

Vision

@strong{Vision}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

This spell functions like @emph{[legend lore],}except that it works more quickly and produces some strain on you. You pose a question about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level; maximum +25) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete. If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information gained is vague. After this spell is complete, you are [fatigued].

@strong{Jump}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a grasshopper's hind leg)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The subject gets a +10 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics checks made to attempt high jumps or long jumps. The enhancement bonus increases to +20 at caster level 5th, and to +30 (the maximum) at caster level 9th.

For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional warriors---they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

@strong{Role}: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.

@strong{Alignment}: Any nonlawful.

@node Barbarian Class Features
@subsection Barbarian Class Features
@anchor{#barbarian-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: A barbarian is proficient with all [simple] and [martial] weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

@strong{Fast Movement}: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.

@strong{Rage}: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her [Constitution] modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds. Temporary increases to [Constitution], such as those gained from rage and spells like @emph{[bear's endurance],} do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her [Strength] and [Constitution], as well as a +2 morale bonus on [Will saves]. In addition, she takes a --2 penalty to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}. The increase to [Constitution] grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like [temporary hit points]. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any [Charisma]-, [Dexterity]-, or [Intelligence]-based skills , @ref{#fly,Fly}, @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}, and @ref{#ride,Ride}) or any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is [fatigued] after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while [fatigued] or [exhausted] but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls [unconscious], her rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.

@strong{Rage Powers}: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

@emph{Animal Fury}: While raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus --5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 points of damage if Small) plus half the barbarian's [Strength] modifier. A barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.

@emph{Clear Mind: A barbarian may reroll a failed [Will save].}This power is used as an immediate action after the first save @emph{is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The}barbarian must take the second result, even if it is worse. A @emph{barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this}power. This power can only be used once per rage.

@emph{Fearless Rage}: While raging, the barbarian is immune to the [shaken] and [frightened] conditions. A barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this rage power.

@emph{Guarded Stance: The barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus] to}her @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against melee attacks for a number of rounds @emph{equal to the barbarian's current [Constitution] modifier . This}bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has @emph{attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not}provoke an [attack of opportunity].

@emph{Increased Damage Reduction: The barbarian's [damage *reduction] increases by 1/---. This increase is always active}while the barbarian is raging. A barbarian can select this rage @emph{power up to three times. Its effects stack. A barbarian must be}at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

@emph{Internal Fortitude}: While raging, the barbarian is immune to the [sickened] and [nauseated] conditions. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

@emph{Intimidating Glare: The barbarian can make an @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}}check against one adjacent foe as a move action. If the @emph{barbarian successfully demoralizes her opponent, the foe is}[shaken] for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which *the barbarian's check exceeds the DC.

@emph{Knockback: Once per round, the barbarian can make a [bull *rush] attempt against one target in place of a melee attack. If}successful, the target takes damage equal to the barbarian's @emph{[Strength] modifier and is moved back as normal. The barbarian}does not need to move with the target if successful. This does *not provoke an [attack of opportunity].

@emph{Low-Light Vision: The barbarian's senses sharpen and she}gains [low-light vision] while raging.

@emph{Mighty Swing: The barbarian automatically confirms a}[critical hit]. This power is used as an immediate action once a @emph{critical threat has been determined. A barbarian must be at}least 12th level before selecting this power. This power can *only be used once per rage.

@emph{Moment of Clarity: The barbarian does not gain any benefits}or take any of the penalties from rage for 1 round. Activating @emph{this power is a swift action. This includes the penalty to}@ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} and the restriction on what actions can be @emph{performed. This round still counts against her total number of}rounds of rage per day. This power can only be used once per *rage.

@emph{Night Vision: The barbarian's senses grow incredibly sharp}while raging and she gains [darkvision] 60 feet. A barbarian @emph{must have [low-light vision] as a rage power or a racial trait}to select this rage power.

@emph{No Escape}: The barbarian can move up to double her normal speed as an immediate action but she can only use this ability when an adjacent foe uses a [withdraw action] to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used the [withdraw action]. The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during this movement. This power can only be used once per rage.

@emph{Powerful Blow}: The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on a single damage roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be used once per rage.

@emph{Quick Reflexes}: While raging, the barbarian can make one additional [attack of opportunity] per round.

@emph{Raging Climber}: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all [Climb][skill checks].

@emph{Raging Leaper}: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all [Acrobatics][skill checks] made to jump. When making a jump in this way, the barbarian is always considered to have a running start.

@emph{Raging Swimmer}: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all [Swim][skill checks].

@emph{Renewed Vigor: As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8}points of damage + her [Constitution] modifier. For every four @emph{levels the barbarian has attained above 4th, this amount of}damage healed increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 20th @emph{level. A barbarian must be at least 4th level before selecting}this power. This power can be used only once per day and only *while raging.

@emph{Rolling Dodge}: The barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus] to her @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against ranged attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's current [Constitution] modifier . This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not provoke an [attack of opportunity].

@emph{Roused Anger: The barbarian may enter a rage even if}[fatigued]. While raging after using this ability, the barbarian @emph{is immune to the [fatigued] condition. Once this rage ends, the}barbarian is [exhausted] for 10 minutes per round spent raging.

@emph{Scent} @emph{[}: The barbarian gains the [scent] ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes (see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities} for rules on the [scent] ability).

@emph{Strength Surge: The barbarian adds her barbarian level on}one [Strength] check or [combat maneuver check], or to her @emph{[Combat Maneuver Defense] when an opponent attempts a maneuver}against her. This power is used as an immediate action. This *power can only be used once per rage.

@emph{Superstition}: The barbarian gains a +2 morale bonus on [saving throws] made to resist spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. While raging, the barbarian cannot be a willing target of any spell and must make [saving throws] to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.

@emph{Surprise Accuracy: The barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on}one attack roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels @emph{the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift}action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be *used once per rage.

@emph{Swift Foot: The barbarian gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus}to her speed. This increase is always active while the barbarian @emph{is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three}times. Its effects stack.

@emph{Terrifying Howl: The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl}as a standard action. All [shaken] enemies within 30 feet must @emph{make a [Will save] (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level +}the barbarian's [Strength] modifier) or be [panicked] for 1d4+1 @emph{rounds. Once an enemy has made a save versus terrifying howl ,}it is immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must have @emph{the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power. A}barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this *power.

@emph{Unexpected Strike}: The barbarian can make an [attack of opportunity] against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an [attack of opportunity]. This power can only be used once per rage. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.

@strong{Uncanny Dodge}: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught [flat-footed], even if the attacker is [invisible]. She still loses her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

@strong{Trap Sense}: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on [Reflex saves] made to avoid traps and a +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC] against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter . Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

@strong{Improved Uncanny Dodge}: At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

@strong{Damage Reduction}: At 7th level, a barbarian gains [damage reduction]. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter , this [damage reduction] rises by 1 point. [Damage reduction] can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

@strong{Greater Rage}: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her [Strength] and [Constitution] increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves] increases to +3.

@strong{Indomitable Will}: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on [Will saves] to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on [Will saves] she also receives during her rage.

@strong{Tireless Rage}: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes [fatigued] at the end of her rage.

@strong{Mighty Rage}: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her [Strength] and [Constitution] increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves] increases to +4.

Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they claim the treasures of each.

@strong{Role}: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies outside melee, where they can support their companions and undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their performances.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@node Bard Class Features
@subsection Bard Class Features
@anchor{#bard-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the bard.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: A bard is proficient with all [simple] weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are also proficient with light armor and shields . A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor and use a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

@strong{Spells}: A bard casts arcane spells drawn from the [bard spell list] presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a [verbal component] (song, recitation, or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a [Charisma] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's [Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on [Table: Bard]. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high [Charisma] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the bard's choice. At each new bard level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on [Table: Bard Spells Known]. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his [Charisma] score. The numbers on [Table: Bard Spells Known] are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that , a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

A bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

@strong{Bardic Knowledge}: A bard adds half his class level to all [Knowledge][skill checks] and may make all [Knowledge][skill
checks] untrained.

@strong{Bardic Performance}: A bard is trained to use the @ref{#perform,Perform} skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his [Charisma] modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.

Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, [paralyzed], [stunned], knocked [unconscious], or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.

Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.

If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.

If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.

@emph{Countersong}: At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound . Each round of the countersong he makes a @ref{#perform,Perform} (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's @ref{#perform,Perform} check result in place of its [saving throw] if, after the [saving throw] is rolled, the @ref{#perform,Perform} check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another [saving throw] against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's @ref{#perform,Perform} skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don't allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.

@emph{Distraction}: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the distraction, he makes a @ref{#perform,Perform} (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard that is affected by an [illusion ] or [illusion ] magical attack may use the bard's @ref{#perform,Perform} check result in place of its [saving throw] if, after the [saving throw] is rolled, the @ref{#perform,Perform} skill check proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the distraction is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous [illusion ] or [illusion ] magical attack, it gains another [saving throw] against the effect each round it sees the distraction, but it must use the bard's @ref{#perform,Perform} skill check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don't allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.

@emph{Fascinate}: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become [fascinated] with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from working. For every three levels the bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.

Each creature within range receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's [saving throw] succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its [saving throw] fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a --4 penalty on all [skill checks] made as reactions, such as @ref{#perception,Perception} checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new [saving throw] against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.

Fascinate is an [enchantment ], mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.

@emph{Inspire Courage}: A 1st-level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies , bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard's performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on [saving throws] against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.

@emph{Inspire Competence}: A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. That ally must be within 30 feet and be able to hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on [skill checks] with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard's performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th). Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as @ref{#stealth,Stealth}, and may be disallowed at the GM's discretion. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.

@emph{Suggestion}: A bard of 6th level or higher can use his performance to make a @emph{[suggestion]} (as per the spell) to a creature he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). A bard can use this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance.

Making a @emph{suggestion} does not count against a bard's daily use of bardic performance. A [Will saving throw] (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. @emph{Suggestion}is an [enchantment ], mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.

@emph{Dirge of Doom}: A bard of 8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become [shaken]. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard's performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues his performance. This performance cannot cause a creature to become [frightened] or [panicked], even if the targets are already [shaken] from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components.

@emph{Inspire Greatness}: A bard of 9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels the bard attains beyond 9th, he can target an additional ally while using this performance . To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of [temporary hit points] (apply the target's [Constitution] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on [Fortitude saves]. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.

@emph{Soothing Performance: A bard of 12th level or higher can use}his performance to create an effect equivalent to a @emph{[mass cure *serious wounds],}using the bard's level as the caster level. In @emph{addition, this performance removes the [fatigued], [sickened],}and [shaken] conditions from all those affected. Using this @emph{ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the}targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the @emph{performance. Soothing performance affects all targets that}remain within 30 feet throughout the performance. Soothing *performance relies on audible and visual components.

@emph{Frightening Tune}: A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to cause fear in his enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes [frightened] and flees for as long as the target can hear the bard's performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components.

@emph{Inspire Heroics: A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire}tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30 @emph{feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond}15th, he can inspire heroics in an additional creature. To @emph{inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear}the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on [saving *throws] and a +4 [dodge bonus] to [AC]. This effect lasts for as @emph{long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire}heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and *visual components.

@emph{Mass Suggestion}: This ability functions just like @emph{suggestion,}but allows a bard of 18th level or higher to make a @emph{suggestion} simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated. @emph{Mass suggestion} is an [enchantment ], mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible components.

@emph{Deadly Performance}: A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet. The target receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature's [saving throw] succeeds, the target is [staggered] for 1d4 rounds, and the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24 hours. If a creature's [saving throw] fails, it dies. Deadly performance is a mind-affecting death effect that relies on audible and visual components.

@strong{Cantrips}: Bards learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on [Table: Bard Spells Known] under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.

@strong{Versatile Performance}: At 2nd level, a bard can choose one type of @ref{#perform,Perform} skill. He can use his bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total @ref{#perform,Perform} skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill's bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can select an additional type of @ref{#perform,Perform} to substitute.

The types of @ref{#perform,Perform} and their associated skills are: Act (@ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#disguise,Disguise}), Comedy (@ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}), Dance (@ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics}, @ref{#fly,Fly}), Keyboard Instruments (@ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}, @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}), Oratory (@ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}, @ref{#sense-motive,Sense Motive}), Percussion (@ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal}, @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate}), Sing (@ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#sense-motive,Sense Motive}), String (@ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}), and Wind (@ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}, @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal}).

@strong{Well-Versed}: At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4 bonus on [saving throws] made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.

@strong{Lore Master}: At 5th level, the bard becomes a master of lore and can take 10 on any @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} skill check that he has ranks in. A bard can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, the bard can take 20 on any @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} skill check as a standard action. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.

@strong{Jack-of-All-Trades}: At 10th level, the bard can use any skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained. At 16th level, the bard considers all skills to be class skills. At 19th level, the bard can take 10 on any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed.

@node Cleric
@section Cleric
@anchor{#cleric}
In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.

@strong{Role}: More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need.

As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion---such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge---free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)

@strong{Alignment}: A cleric's [alignment] must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@node Cleric Class Features
@subsection Cleric Class Features
@anchor{#cleric-class-features}
The following are class features of the cleric.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Clerics are proficient with all [simple] weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deity.

@strong{Aura}: A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's [alignment] (see the @emph{[detect evil]} spell for details).

@strong{Spells}: A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the [cleric spell list] presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. Her [alignment], however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see [chaotic, evil, good, and lawful spells]. A cleric must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a [Wisdom] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on [Table: Cleric]. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

@strong{Channel Energy}: Regardless of [alignment], any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.

A good cleric channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric casts spontaneous cure or inflict spells .

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st . Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a [Will save] to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's [Charisma] modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total---all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her [Charisma] modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an [attack of opportunity]. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.

@strong{Domains}: A cleric's deity influences her [alignment], what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an [alignment] domain only if her [alignment] matches that domain. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities . The restriction on [alignment] domains still applies.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.

In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, using a domain power is a standard action. Cleric domains are listed at the end of this class entry.

@strong{Orisons}: Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on [Table: Cleric] under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

@strong{Spontaneous Casting}: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).

An evil cleric can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells . Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric channels positive or negative energy (see [Channel Energy]).

@strong{Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells}: A cleric can't cast spells of an [alignment] opposed to her own or her deity's . Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.

@strong{Bonus Languages}: A cleric's bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

@node Ex-Clerics
@subsection Ex-Clerics
@anchor{#ex-clerics}
A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by her god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with [simple] weapons. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until she atones for her deeds (see the @emph{[atonement]} spell description).

@node Domains
@subsection Domains
@anchor{#domains}
Clerics may select any two of the domains granted by their deity. Clerics without a deity may select any two domains (choice are subject to GM approval).

@anchor{#air-domain}
@strong{Granted Powers}: You can manipulate lightning, mist, and wind, traffic with air creatures, and are resistant to electricity damage.

@emph{Lightning Arc}: As a standard action, you can unleash an arc of electricity targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This arc of electricity deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

@emph{Electricity Resistance}: At 6th level, you gain resist electricity 10. This resistance increases to 20 at 12th level. At 20th level, you gain immunity to electricity.

@emph{Speak with Animals}: You can @emph{speak with animals}, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your cleric level.

@emph{Animal Companion}: At 4th level, you gain the service of an animal companion. Your effective druid level for this animal companion is equal to your cleric level -- 3. (Druids who take this ability through their nature bond class feature use their druid level -- 3 to determine the abilities of their animal companions).

@strong{Domain Spells}: 1st---@emph{[calm animals],}2nd---@emph{[hold animal],}3rd---@emph{[dominate animal],}4th---@emph{[summon nature's ally IV]} , 5th---@emph{[beast shape III]}(animals only)@emph{,}6th---@emph{[antilife shell],}7th---@emph{[animal shapes],}8th---@emph{[summon nature's ally VIII]}(animals only), 9th---@emph{[shapechange].}

@node Artifice Domain
@subsection Artifice Domain
@anchor{#artifice-domain}
@strong{Granted Powers}: You can repair damage to objects, animate objects with life, and create objects from nothing.

@emph{Artificer's Touch}: You can cast @emph{mending}at will, using your cleric level as the caster level to repair damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to objects and construct creatures by striking them with a melee touch attack. Objects and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two cleric levels you possess. This attack bypasses an amount of [damage reduction] and hardness equal to your cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

@emph{Dancing Weapons}: At 8th level, you can give a weapon touched the @emph{dancing}special weapon quality for 4 rounds. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th.

@strong{Domain Spells}: 1st---@emph{[animate rope],}2nd---@emph{[wood shape],}3rd---@emph{[stone shape],}4th---@emph{[minor creation],}5th---@emph{[fabricate],}6th---@emph{[major creation],}7th---@emph{[wall of iron],}8th---@emph{[instant summons],}9th---@emph{[prismatic sphere].}

@node Chaos Domain
@subsection Chaos Domain
@anchor{#chaos-domain}
@strong{Granted Powers}: Your touch infuses life and weapons with chaos, and you revel in all things anarchic.

@emph{Touch of Chaos}: You can imbue a target with chaos as a melee touch attack. For the next round, anytime the target rolls a d20, he must roll twice and take the less favorable result. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

@emph{Chaos Blade}: At 8th level, you can give a weapon touched the@emph{anarchic}special weapon quality for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and an additional time per day for every four levels beyond 8th.

@strong{Domain Spells}: 1st---@emph{[protection from law],}2nd---@emph{[align weapon]}, 3rd---@emph{[magic circle against law],}4th---@emph{[chaos hammer],}5th---@emph{[dispel law],}6th---@emph{[animate objects],}7th---@emph{[word of chaos],}8th---@emph{[cloak of chaos],}9th---@emph{[summon monster IX]} .

@node Charm Domain
@subsection Charm Domain
@anchor{#charm-domain}
@strong{Granted Powers}: You can baffle and befuddle foes with a touch or a smile, and your beauty and grace are divine.

@emph{Dazing Touch}: You can cause a living creature to become [dazed] for 1 round as a melee touch attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your cleric level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

@emph{Charming Smile}: At 8th level, you can cast @emph{[charm person]} as a swift action, with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your [Wisdom] modifier. You can only have one creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number of rounds of this effect per day is equal to your cleric level. The rounds do not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss the charm at any time as a free action. Each attempt to use this ability consumes 1 round of its duration, whether or not the creature succeeds on its save to resist the effect.

@strong{Domain Spells}: 1st---@emph{[charm person],}2nd---@emph{[calm emotions],}3rd---*[suggestion], @emph{4th---}[heroism], @emph{5th---}[charm monster], @strong{6th---*[geas/quest], @emph{7th---}[insanity], @emph{8th---}[demand],}9th---@emph{[dominate monster]}.

@node Community Domain
@subsection Community Domain
@anchor{#community-domain}
@strong{Granted Powers}: Your touch can heal wounds, and your presence instills unity and strengthens emotional bonds.

@emph{Calming Touch}: You can touch a creature as a standard action to heal it of 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 point per cleric level. This touch also removes the [fatigued], [shaken], and [sickened] conditions (but has no effect on more severe conditions). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

@emph{Unity}: At 8th level, whenever a spell or effect targets you and one or more allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your allies to use your [saving throw] against the effect in place of their own. Each ally must decide individually before the rolls are made. Using this ability is an immediate action. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every four cleric levels beyond 8th.

@strong{Domain Spells}: 1st---@emph{[bless],}2nd---@emph{[shield other],}3rd---@emph{[prayer]}, 4th---@emph{[imbue with spell ability],}5th---@emph{[telepathic bond],}6th---@emph{[heroes' feast],}7th---@emph{[refuge],}8th---@emph{[mass cure critical wounds],}9th---@emph{[miracle]}.

@node Darkness Domain
@subsection Darkness Domain
@anchor{#darkness-domain}

@node Druid
@section Druid
@anchor{#druid}
Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

@strong{Role}: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.

@strong{Alignment}: Any neutral.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@node Druid Class Features
@subsection Druid Class Features
@anchor{#druid-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the druid.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks of any form they assume with wild shape .

Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the @emph{ironwood} spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields but must use only those crafted from wood.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

@strong{Spells}: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the druid spell list presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. Her [alignment] may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a [Wisdom] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

@strong{Spontaneous Casting}: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any @emph{summon nature's ally} spell of the same level or lower.

@strong{Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells}: A druid can't cast spells of an [alignment] opposed to her own or her deity's . Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

@strong{Orisons}: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Druid under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

@strong{Bonus Languages}: A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.

Druidic has its own alphabet.

@strong{Nature Bond}: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.

The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in [Animal Choices]. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.

Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

@strong{Nature Sense}: A druid gains a +2 bonus on @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} and @ref{#survival,Survival} checks.

@strong{Wild Empathy}: A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a @ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy} check made to improve the attitude of a person (see [Using Skills]). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her [Charisma] modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2, but she takes a --4 penalty on the check.

@strong{Woodland Stride}: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.

@strong{Trackless Step}: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

@strong{Resist Nature's Lure}: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on [saving throws] against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as @emph{[blight], [entangle], [spike growth],}and @emph{[warp wood].}

@strong{Wild Shape}: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the @emph{[beast shape I]} spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form is a standard action and doesn't provoke an [attack of opportunity]. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.

At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[beast shape II]}. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as @emph{[elemental body I]}.

At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[beast shape III]}. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[elemental body II]}. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as @emph{[plant shape I]}.

At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[elemental body III]}. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[plant shape II]}.

At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[elemental body IV]}. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as @emph{[plant shape III]}.

@strong{Venom Immunity}: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

@strong{A Thousand Faces}: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the @emph{[alter self]} spell, but only while in her normal form.

@strong{Timeless Body}: After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

@node Ex-Druids
@subsection Ex-Druids
@anchor{#ex-druids}
A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited [alignment], or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the @emph{[atonement]} spell description).

@node Animal Companions
@subsection Animal Companions
@anchor{#animal-companions}
An animal companion's abilities are determined by the druid's level and its animal racial traits. Table: Animal Companion Base Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the animal companion. They remain creatures of the animal type for purposes of determining which spells can affect them.

@caption{Table: Animal Companion Base Statistics}
@end float
@strong{Class Level}: This is the character's druid level. The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's statistics.

@strong{HD}: This is the total number of eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice the animal companion possesses, each of which gains a [Constitution] modifier, as normal.

@strong{BAB}: This is the animal companion's base attack bonus. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. Animal companions do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.

@strong{Fort/[Ref]/Will}: These are the animal companion's base [saving throw] bonuses. An animal companion has good [Fortitude] and [Reflex saves].

@strong{Skills}: This lists the animal's total skill ranks. Animal companions can assign skill ranks to any skill listed under Animal Skills. If an animal companion increases its [Intelligence] to 10 or higher, it gains bonus skill ranks as normal. Animal companions with an [Intelligence] of 3 or higher can purchase ranks in any skill. An animal companion cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.

@strong{Feats}: This is the total number of feats possessed by an animal companion. Animal companions should select their feats from those listed under Animal Feats. Animal companions can select other feats, although they are unable to utilize some feats . Note that animal companions cannot select a feat with a requirement of base attack bonus +1 until they gain their second feat at 3 Hit Dice.

@strong{Natural Armor Bonus}: The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.

@strong{Str/Dex Bonus}: Add this modifier to the animal companion's [Strength] and [Dexterity] scores.

@strong{Bonus Tricks}: The value given in this column is the total number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal} skill for more details on how to teach an animal tricks). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal} checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.

@strong{Special}: This includes a number of abilities gained by animal companions as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.

@emph{Link [:} A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal} skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and @ref{#handle-animal,Handle Animal} checks made regarding an animal companion.

@emph{Share Spells [:} The druid may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion instead of on herself. A druid may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type . Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.

@emph{Evasion [:} If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a [Reflex] save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving throw].

@emph{Ability Score Increase [:} The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.

@emph{Devotion [:} An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on [Will saves] against enchantment spells and effects.

@emph{Multiattack:}An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a --5 penalty.

@emph{Improved Evasion [:} When subjected to an attack that allows a [Reflex][saving throw] for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving throw] and only half damage if the [saving throw] fails.

Animal companions can have ranks in any of the following skills: @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics}* ([Dex]), @ref{#climb,Climb}* ([Str]), @ref{#escape-artist,Escape Artist} ([Dex]), @ref{#fly,Fly}* ([Dex]), @ref{#intimidate,Intimidate} ([Cha]), @ref{#perception,Perception}* ([Wis]), @ref{#stealth,Stealth}* ([Dex]), @ref{#survival,Survival} ([Wis]), and @ref{#swim,Swim}* ([Str]). All of the skills marked with an (*) are class skills for animal companions. Animal companions with an [Intelligence] of 3 or higher can put ranks into any skill.

@node Animal Feats
@subsection Animal Feats
@anchor{#animal-feats}
Animal companions can select from the following feats: @ref{#acrobatic,Acrobatic}, [Agile Maneuvers], [Armor Proficiency] (light, medium, and heavy), @ref{#athletic,Athletic}, [Blind-Fight], [Combat Reflexes], @ref{#diehard,Diehard}, [Dodge], @ref{#endurance,Endurance}, @ref{#great-fortitude,Great Fortitude}, [Improved Bull Rush], [Improved Initiative], Improved Natural Armor, Improved Natural Attack, [Improved Overrun], [Intimidating Prowess], @ref{#iron-will,Iron Will}, @ref{#lightning-reflexes,Lightning Reflexes}, [Mobility], [Power Attack], @ref{#run,Run}, @ref{#skill-focus,Skill Focus}, [Spring Attack], @ref{#stealthy,Stealthy}, @ref{#toughness,Toughness}, [Weapon Finesse], and [Weapon Focus]. Animal companions with an [Intelligence] of 3 or higher can select any feat they are physically capable of using. GMs might expand this list to include feats from other sources.

@node Druid Animal Choices
@subsection Druid Animal Choices
@anchor{#druid-animal-choices}
Each animal companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All animal attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Animal attacks add the animal's [Strength] modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 its [Strength] modifier. Some have special abilities, such as [scent]. See @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities} for more information on these abilities. As you gain levels, your animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or 7th level, in addition to the standard bonuses noted on Table: Animal Companion Base Statistics. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's [Dexterity] and [Constitution] by 2.

@node Fighter

@anchor{#fighter}
Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot, training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to those who dare stand against them.

@strong{Role}: Fighters excel at combat---defeating their enemies, controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle prowess.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@node Fighter Class Features
@subsection Fighter Class Features
@anchor{#fighter-class-features}
The following are class features of the fighter.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: A fighter is proficient with all [simple] and [martial] weapons and with all armor and shields .

@strong{Bonus Feats}: At 1st level, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as [combat feats], sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”

Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the level.

@strong{Bravery}: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on [Will saves] against fear. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.

@strong{Armor Training}: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 and increases the maximum [Dexterity] bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum --4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum [Dexterity] bonus allowed.

In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

@strong{Weapon Training}: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Every four levels thereafter , a fighter becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.

A fighter also adds this bonus to any [combat maneuver checks] made with weapons from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's [Combat Maneuver Defense] when defending against [disarm] and [sunder] attempts made against weapons from this group.

Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons to these groups, or add entirely new groups):

@emph{Axes}: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, heavy pick, light pick, orc double axe, and throwing axe.

@emph{Blades, Heavy}: bastard sword, elven curve blade, falchion, greatsword, longsword, scimitar, scythe, and two-bladed sword.

@emph{Blades, Light}: dagger, kama, kukri, rapier, sickle, starknife, and short sword.

@emph{Bows}: composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, and shortbow.

@emph{Close}: gauntlet, heavy shield, light shield, punching dagger, sap, spiked armor, spiked gauntlet, spiked shield, and unarmed strike.

@emph{Crossbows}: hand crossbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, heavy repeating crossbow, and light repeating crossbow.

@emph{Double}: dire flail, dwarven urgrosh, gnome hooked hammer, orc double axe, quarterstaff, and two-bladed sword.

@emph{Flails}: dire flail, flail, heavy flail, morningstar, nunchaku, spiked chain, and whip.

@emph{Hammers}: club, greatclub, heavy mace, light hammer, light mace, and warhammer.

@emph{Monk}: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and unarmed strike.

@emph{Natural}: unarmed strike and all natural weapons, such as bite, claw, gore, tail, and wing.

@emph{Pole Arms}: glaive, guisarme, halberd, and ranseur.

@emph{Spears}: javelin, lance, longspear, shortspear, spear, and trident.

@emph{Thrown}: blowgun, bolas, club, dagger, dart, halfling sling staff, javelin, light hammer, net, shortspear, shuriken, sling, spear, starknife, throwing axe, and trident.

@strong{Armor Mastery}: At 19th level, a fighter gains [DR] 5/--- whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

@strong{Weapon Mastery}: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 . In addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.

@node Monk
@section Monk
@anchor{#monk}
For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield---it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

@strong{Role}: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.

@strong{Alignment}: Any lawful.

@node Monk Class Features
@subsection Monk Class Features
@anchor{#monk-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the monk.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow , dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shortspear, short sword, shuriken, siangham, sling, and spear.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.

When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his [AC] bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

@strong{AC Bonus}: When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his [Wisdom] bonus (if any) to his [AC] and his [CMD]. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to [AC] and [CMD] at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

These bonuses to [AC] apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is [flat-footed]. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or [helpless], when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.

@strong{Flurry of Blows}: Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When doing so he may make one additional attack using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with a special monk weapon (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham) as if using the @ref{#two-weapon-fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting} feat (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat). For the purpose of these attacks, the monk's base attack bonus from his monk class levels is equal to his monk level. For all other purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal base attack bonus.

At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he uses flurry of blows, as if using [Improved Two-Weapon Fighting] (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using flurry of blows, as if using [Greater Two-Weapon Fighting] (even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

A monk applies his full [Strength] bonus to his damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his flurry of blows attacks.

@strong{Unarmed Strike}: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full [Strength] bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.

Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.

A monk's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed damage values listed on Table: Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage on the table given below.

@end float
@strong{Bonus Feat:} At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk may select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list: [Catch Off-Guard], [Combat Reflexes], [Deflect Arrows], [Dodge], [Improved Grapple], [Scorpion Style], and [Throw Anything]. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: [Gorgon's Fist], [Improved Bull Rush], [Improved Disarm], [Improved Feint], [Improved Trip], and [Mobility]. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: [Improved Critical], [Medusa's Wrath], [Snatch Arrows], and [Spring Attack]. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

@strong{Stunning Fist}: At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful [saving throw] still negates the effect. At 4th level, he can choose to make the target [fatigued]. At 8th level, he can make the target [sickened] for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target [staggered] for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature [sickened] by Stunning Fist cannot become [nauseated] if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.

@strong{Evasion}: At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful [Reflex][saving throw] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A [helpless] monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

@strong{Fast Movement}: At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table: Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

@strong{Maneuver Training}: At 3rd level, a monk uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus when calculating his [Combat Maneuver Bonus]. Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are unaffected and are added normally.

@strong{Still Mind}: A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on [saving throws] against enchantment spells and effects.

@strong{@emph{Ki} Pool}: At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of @emph{ki}points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's @emph{ki} pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his [Wisdom] modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his @emph{ki} pool, he can make a @emph{ki} strike. At 4th level, @emph{ki} strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction]. @emph{Ki} strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction]. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction] and bypassing hardness.

By spending 1 point from his @emph{ki} pool, a monk can make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a monk can spend 1 point from his @emph{ki} pool to give himself a +4 [dodge bonus] to [AC] for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his @emph{ki} pool as he gains levels.

The @emph{ki} pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.

@strong{Slow Fall}: At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent. When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.

@strong{High Jump}: At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics} checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics}. By spending 1 point from his @emph{ki} pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20 bonus on @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics} checks made to jump for 1 round.

@strong{Purity of Body}: At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

@strong{Wholeness of Body}: At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a standard action. He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his @emph{ki} pool.

@strong{Improved Evasion}: At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex][saving throw] against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A [helpless] monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

@strong{Diamond Body}: At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.

@strong{Abundant Step}: At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell @emph{[dimension door]}. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from his @emph{ki} pool. His caster level for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.

@strong{Diamond Soul}: At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.

@strong{Quivering Palm}: Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die , and unless the target makes a [Fortitude][saving throw] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's [Wis] modifier), it dies. If the [saving throw] is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.

@strong{Timeless Body}: At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.

@strong{Tongue of the Sun and Moon}: A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.

@strong{Empty Body}: At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell @emph{[etherealness].} Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from his @emph{ki} pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.

@strong{Perfect Self}: At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains [damage reduction] 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar [damage reduction]. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type.

Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

@strong{Role}: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the chaos of battle. While deadly opponents of evil, they can also empower goodly souls to aid in their crusades. Their magic and martial skills also make them well suited to defending others and blessing the fallen with the strength to continue fighting.

@strong{Alignment}: Lawful good.

@strong{Hit Die}: d10.

@node Paladin Class Features
@subsection Paladin Class Features
@anchor{#paladin-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the paladin.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Paladins are proficient with all [simple] and [martial] weapons, with all types of armor , and with shields .

@strong{Aura of Good}: The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the @emph{[detect good]} spell) is equal to her paladin level.

@strong{Detect Evil: At will, a paladin can use @emph{[detect evil],}}as the spell. A paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a @strong{single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is}evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it @strong{for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the}paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual **within range.

@strong{Smite Evil}: Once per day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the paladin adds her [Charisma] bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass any [DR] the creature might possess.

In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a deflection bonus equal to her [Charisma] modifier (if any) to her [AC] against attacks made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.

The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

@strong{Divine Grace}: At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her [Charisma] bonus (if any) on all [saving throws].

@strong{Lay On Hands}: Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her [Charisma] modifier. With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.

Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an [attack of opportunity]. Undead do not receive a [saving throw] against this damage.

@strong{Aura of Courage}: At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear . Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on [saving throws] against fear effects. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is [unconscious] or dead.

@strong{Divine Health}: At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, including mummy rot.

@strong{Mercy}: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin can select one mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin's lay on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.

At 3rd level, the paladin can select from the following initial mercies.

@emph{• Fatigued}: The target is no longer [fatigued].

@emph{• Shaken}: The target is no longer [shaken].

@emph{• Sickened}: The target is no longer [sickened].

At 6th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.

@emph{• Dazed}: The target is no longer [dazed].

@emph{• Diseased}: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as @emph{remove disease}, using the paladin's level as the caster level.

@emph{• Staggered}: The target is no longer [staggered], unless the target is at exactly 0 hit points.

At 9th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.

@emph{• Cursed}: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as @emph{[remove curse],} using the paladin's level as the caster level.

@emph{• Exhausted}: The target is no longer [exhausted]. The paladin must have the fatigue mercy before selecting this mercy.

@emph{• Frightened}: The target is no longer [frightened]. The paladin must have the [shaken] mercy before selecting this mercy.

@emph{• Nauseated}: The target is no longer [nauseated]. The paladin must have the [sickened] mercy before selecting this mercy.

@emph{• Poisoned}: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as @emph{neutralize poison}, using the paladin's level as the caster *level.

At 12th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of those that can be selected.

@emph{• Blinded}: The target is no longer [blinded].

@emph{• Deafened}: The target is no longer [deafened].

@emph{• Paralyzed}: The target is no longer [paralyzed].

@emph{• Stunned}: The target is no longer [stunned].

These abilities are cumulative. For example, a 12th-level paladin's lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and might also cure [fatigued] and [exhausted] conditions as well as removing diseases and neutralizing poisons@emph{.}Once a condition or spell effect is chosen, it can't be changed.

@strong{Channel Positive Energy}: When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to channel positive energy like a cleric. Using this ability consumes two uses of her lay on hands ability. A paladin uses her level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive energy. This is a [Charisma]-based ability.

@strong{Spells}: Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the paladin spell list presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a [Charisma] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a paladin's spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin's [Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Charisma] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]). When Table: Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her [Charisma] score for that spell level.

A paladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is equal to her paladin level -- 3.

@strong{Divine Bond}: Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her god. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.

The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: @emph{[axiomatic]}, @emph{[brilliant energy], [defending], [disruption], [flaming], [flaming burst], [holy], [keen], [merciful]}, and @emph{[speed]}. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost . These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a --1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse or a pony , although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also suitable. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the paladin's level as her effective druid level. Bonded mounts have an [Intelligence] of at least 6.

Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 17th level.

At 11th level, the mount gains the celestial template and becomes a magical beast for the purposes of determining which spells affect it. At 15th level, a paladin's mount gains spell resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.

Should the paladin's mount die, the paladin may not summon another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin takes a --1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

@strong{Aura of Resolve}: At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on [saving throws] against charm effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is [unconscious] or dead.

@strong{Aura of Justice}: At 11th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability.

@strong{Aura of Faith}: At 14th level, a paladin's weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming [damage reduction]. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming [damage reduction].

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is [unconscious] or dead.

@strong{Aura of Righteousness}: At 17th level, a paladin gains [DR] 5/evil and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on [saving throws] against compulsion effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is [unconscious] or dead.

@strong{Holy Champion}: At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her [DR] increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to a @emph{[banishment],} using her paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the @emph{[banishment]} effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately ends. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.

@strong{Code of Conduct}: A paladin must be of lawful good [alignment] and loses all class features except proficiencies if she ever willingly commits an evil act.

Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.

@strong{Associates}: While she may adventure with good or neutral allies, a paladin avoids working with evil characters or with anyone who consistently offends her moral code. Under exceptional circumstances, a paladin can ally with evil associates, but only to defeat what she believes to be a greater evil. A paladin should seek an @emph{[atonement]} spell periodically during such an unusual alliance, and should end the alliance immediately should she feel it is doing more harm than good. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.

@node Ex-Paladins
@subsection Ex-Paladins
@anchor{#ex-paladins}
A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and class features (including the service of the paladin's mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any further in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the @emph{[atonement]} spell description in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}), as appropriate.

@node Ranger
@section Ranger
@anchor{#ranger}
For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters, rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator, skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game---even fugitives among their own people.

@strong{Role}: Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of enemies.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@strong{Hit Die}: d10.

@caption{Ranger Favored Enemies}
@end float
@strong{Favored Enemy}: At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on @ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge}, @ref{#perception,Perception}, @ref{#sense-motive,Sense Motive}, and @ref{#survival,Survival} checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make [Knowledge][skill checks] untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy increases by +2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from---those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

@strong{Track}: A ranger adds half his level to [Survival][skill
checks] made to follow or identify tracks.

@strong{Wild Empathy}: A ranger can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a @ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy} check to improve the attitude of a person (see [Using Skills]). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his [Charisma] bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2, but he takes a --4 penalty on the check.

@strong{Combat Style Feat}: At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites.

If the ranger selects archery, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Far Shot], [Point Blank Shot], [Precise Shot], and [Rapid Shot]. At 6th level, he adds [Improved Precise Shot] and [Manyshot] to the list. At 10th level, he adds [Pinpoint Targeting] and [Shot on the Run] to the list.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he can choose from the following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Double Slice], [Improved Shield Bash], [Quick Draw], and @ref{#two-weapon-fighting,Two-Weapon Fighting}. At 6th level, he adds [Improved Two-Weapon Fighting] and [Two-Weapon Defense] to the list. At 10th level, he adds [Greater Two-Weapon Fighting] and [Two-Weapon Rend] to the list.

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

@strong{Endurance}: A ranger gains @ref{#endurance,Endurance} as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

@caption{Favored Terrains}
@end float
@strong{Favored Terrain}: At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} , @ref{#perception,Perception}, @ref{#stealth,Stealth}, and [Survival][skill checks] when he is in this terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).

At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain , increases by +2.

If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

@strong{Hunter's Bond}: At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's [Wisdom] modifier . This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.

The second option is to form a close bond with an [animal companion]. A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat , dire rat, dog, horse, pony, snake , or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses.

This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability , except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level -- 3.

@strong{Spells}: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a [Wisdom] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high [Wisdom] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]). When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his [Wisdom] score for that spell level.

A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level -- 3.

@strong{Woodland Stride}: Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect him.

@strong{Swift Tracker}: Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using @ref{#survival,Survival} to follow tracks without taking the normal --5 penalty. He takes only a --10 penalty when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

@strong{Evasion}: When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful [Reflex][saving throw] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A [helpless] ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

@strong{Quarry}: At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his [Survival][skill checks] while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.

@strong{Camouflage}: A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the @ref{#stealth,Stealth} skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.

@strong{Improved Evasion}: At 16th level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex][saving
throw] against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A [helpless] ranger does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

@strong{Hide in Plain Sight}: While in any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the @ref{#stealth,Stealth} skill even while being observed.

@strong{Improved Quarry}: At 19th level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using @ref{#survival,Survival} to track his quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.

@strong{Master Hunter}: A ranger of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full speed while using @ref{#survival,Survival} to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action, make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must make a [Fortitude] save or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's [Wisdom] modifier. A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.

@node Rogue
@section Rogue
@anchor{#rogue}
Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess, or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road, journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms might come to be called rogues.

@strong{Role}: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with great variations in expertise existing between different rogues. Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards and conning dull-witted opponents.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@strong{Hit Die}: d8.

@node Rogue Class Features
@subsection Rogue Class Features
@anchor{#rogue-class-features}
The following are class features of the rogue.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Rogues are proficient with all [simple] weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. They are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

@strong{Sneak Attack}: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The rogue's attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be denied a [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (whether the target actually has a [Dexterity] bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a [critical hit] with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual --4 penalty.

The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.

@strong{Trapfinding}: A rogue adds 1/2 her level to [Perception][skill checks] made to locate traps and to [Disable Device][skill checks] . A rogue can use @ref{#disable-device,Disable Device} to disarm magic traps.

@strong{Evasion}: At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful [Reflex][saving throw] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A [helpless] rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

@strong{Rogue Talents}: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.

@emph{Bleeding Attack*}: A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of [bleed]). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 @ref{#heal,Heal} check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any [damage reduction] the creature might possess.

@emph{Combat Trick}: A rogue that selects this talent gains a bonus [combat feat] (see @ref{#feats,Feats}).

@emph{Fast Stealth}: This ability allows a rogue to move at full speed using the @ref{#stealth,Stealth} skill without penalty.

@emph{Finesse Rogue}: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon Finesse] as a bonus feat.

@emph{Ledge Walker}: This ability allows a rogue to move along narrow surfaces at full speed using the @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics} skill without penalty. In addition, a rogue with this talent is not [flat-footed] when using @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics} to move along narrow surfaces.

@emph{Major Magic: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to}cast a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list two @emph{times a day as a [spell-like ability]. The caster level for this}ability is equal to the rogue's level. The save DC for this @emph{spell is 11 + the rogue's [Intelligence] modifier. The rogue}must have an [Intelligence] of at least 11 to select this @emph{talent. A rogue must have the minor magic rogue talent before}choosing this talent.

@emph{Minor Magic: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to}cast a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. This @emph{spell can be cast three times a day as a [spell-like *ability]. The caster level for this ability is equal to the}rogue's level. The save DC for this spell is 10 + the rogue's @emph{[Intelligence] modifier. The rogue must have an [Intelligence]}of at least 10 to select this talent.

@emph{Quick Disable}: It takes a rogue with this ability half the normal amount of time to disable a trap using the @ref{#disable-device,Disable Device} skill .

@emph{Resiliency}: Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of [temporary hit points] equal to the rogue's level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can only be performed when she is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent her from [dying]. These [temporary hit points] last for 1 minute. If the rogue's hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these [temporary hit points], she falls [unconscious] and is [dying] as normal.

@emph{Rogue Crawl}: While [prone], a rogue with this ability can move at half speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A rogue with this talent can take a 5-foot step while crawling.

@emph{Slow Reactions*}: Opponents damaged by the rogue's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.

@emph{Stand Up}: A rogue with this ability can stand up from a [prone] position as a free action. This still provokes attacks of opportunity for standing up while threatened by a foe.

@emph{Surprise Attack}: During the surprise round, opponents are always considered [flat-footed] to a rogue with this ability, even if they have already acted.

@emph{Trap Spotter}: Whenever a rogue with this talent comes within 10 feet of a trap, she receives an immediate @ref{#perception,Perception} skill check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM.

@emph{Weapon Training}: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon Focus] as a bonus feat.

@strong{Trap Sense}: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on [Reflex saves] made to avoid traps and a +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC] against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

@strong{Uncanny Dodge}: Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught [flat-footed], nor does she lose her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is [invisible]. She still loses her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. A rogue with this ability can still lose her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

@strong{Improved Uncanny Dodge}: A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.

This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

@strong{Advanced Talents}: At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced talents in place of a rogue talent.

@emph{Crippling Strike*: A rogue with this ability can sneak}attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and @emph{hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks}also takes 2 points of [Strength] damage.

@emph{Defensive Roll: With this advanced talent, the rogue can}roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it @emph{than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be}reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a @emph{weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue}can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the @emph{rogue must attempt a [Reflex][saving throw] . If the save}succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, @emph{she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able}to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll---if she is @emph{denied her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], she can't use this}ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character @emph{to make a [Reflex] save for half damage, the rogue's evasion}ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

@emph{Dispelling Attack*}: Opponents that are dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability are affected by a targeted @emph{[dispel magic]}, targeting the lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have the major magic rogue talent before choosing dispelling attack.

@emph{Improved Evasion: This works like evasion, except that while}the rogue still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex] saving @emph{throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on}a failed save. A [helpless] rogue does not gain the benefit of *improved evasion.

@emph{Opportunist: Once per round, the rogue can make an [attack *of opportunity] against an opponent who has just been struck for}damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an @emph{[attack of opportunity] for that round. Even a rogue with the}Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than *once per round.

@emph{Skill Mastery}: The rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her [Intelligence] modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.

@emph{Slippery Mind: This ability represents the rogue's ability}to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise @emph{control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected}by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her [saving throw], @emph{she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets}only this one extra chance to succeed on her [saving throw].

@emph{Feat}: A rogue may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place of a rogue talent.

@strong{Master Strike}@emph{[}: Upon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, [paralyzed] for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a [Fortitude] save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's [Intelligence] modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that rogue's master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.

@node Sorcerer
@section Sorcerer
@anchor{#sorcerer}
Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.

@strong{Role}: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@strong{Hit Die}: d6.

@node Sorcerer Class Features
@subsection Sorcerer Class Features
@anchor{#sorcerer-class-features}
All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Sorcerers are proficient with all [simple] weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see @ref{#arcane-spells-and-armor,Arcane Spells and Armor}).

@strong{Spells}: A sorcerer casts arcane spells drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a [Charisma] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's [Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Sorcerer. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Charisma] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by her [Charisma] score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of through study.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that , a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the sorcerer loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.

@strong{Bloodline}: Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.

At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.

@strong{Cantrips}: Sorcerers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known under “Spells Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.

@strong{Eschew Materials}: A sorcerer gains @ref{#eschew-materials,Eschew Materials} as a bonus feat at 1st level.

@node Sorcerer Bloodlines

@node Aberrant
@subsubsection Aberrant
@anchor{#aberrant}
There is a taint in your blood, one that is alien and bizarre. You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle that most would not expect. Over time, this taint manifests itself in your physical form.

@strong{Class Skill}: @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} .

@strong{Bonus Spells}: @emph{[enlarge person]} (3rd), @emph{[see invisibility]} , @emph{[tongues]} , @emph{[black tentacles]} , @emph{[feeblemind]} , @emph{[veil]}, @emph{[plane shift]} , @emph{[mind blank]} , @emph{[shapechange]}.

@strong{Bonus Feats}: @ref{#combat-casting,Combat Casting}, [Improved Disarm], [Improved Grapple], [Improved Initiative], [Improved Unarmed Strike], @ref{#iron-will,Iron Will}, [Silent Spell], @ref{#skill-focus,Skill Focus} ([Knowledge][dungeoneering]).

@strong{Bloodline Arcana}: Whenever you cast a spell of the [polymorph] subschool, increase the duration of the spell by 50% . This bonus does not stack with the increase granted by the [Extend Spell] feat.

@strong{Bloodline Powers}: Aberrant sorcerers show increasing signs of their tainted heritage as they increase in level, although they are only visible when used.

@emph{Acidic Ray}: Starting at 1st level, you can fire an acidic ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

@emph{Long Limbs}: At 3rd level, your reach increases by 5 feet whenever you are making a melee touch attack. This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 15 feet.

@emph{Unusual Anatomy}: At 9th level, your anatomy changes, giving you a 25% chance to ignore any [critical hit] or sneak attack scored against you. This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.

@emph{Alien Resistance}: At 15th level, you gain spell resistance equal to your sorcerer level + 10.

@emph{Aberrant Form}: At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and [damage reduction] 5/---.

@node Abyssal
@subsubsection Abyssal
@anchor{#abyssal}
Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and [alignment]) is up to you.

@strong{Class Skill}: @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} .

@strong{Bonus Spells}: @emph{[cause fear]} (3rd), @emph{[bull's strength]} , @emph{[rage]} , @emph{[stoneskin]} , @emph{[dismissal]} , @emph{[transformation]} , @emph{[greater teleport]} , @emph{[unholy aura]} , @emph{[summon monster IX]} .

@strong{Bonus Feats}: @ref{#augment-summoning,Augment Summoning}, [Cleave], [Empower Spell], @ref{#great-fortitude,Great Fortitude}, [Improved Bull Rush], [Improved Sunder], [Power Attack], @ref{#skill-focus,Skill Focus} ([Knowledge][planes]).

@strong{Bloodline Arcana}: Whenever you cast a spell of the [summoning] subschool, the creatures summoned gain [DR]/good equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level . This does not stack with any [DR] the creature might have.

@strong{Bloodline Powers}: While some would say that you are possessed, you know better. The demonic influence in your blood grows as you gain power.

@emph{Claws}: At 1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d4 points of damage each plus your [Strength] modifier. At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [DR]. At 7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of damage . At 11th level, these claws become @emph{flaming} @emph{weapons}, each dealing an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

@emph{Demon Resistances}: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity 5 and a +2 bonus on [saving throws] made against poison. At 9th level, your resistance to electricity increases to 10 and your bonus on poison [saving throws] increases to +4.

@emph{Strength of the Abyss}: At 9th level, you gain a +2 inherent bonus to your [Strength]. This bonus increases to +4 at 13th level, and to +6 at 17th level.

@emph{Added Summonings}: At 15th level, whenever you summon a creature with the demon subtype or the fiendish template using a @emph{[summon monster]} spell, you summon one additional creature of the same kind.

@emph{Demonic Might: At 20th level, the power of the Abyss flows}through you. You gain immunity to electricity and poison. You @emph{also gain resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and gain}telepathy with a range of 60 feet (allowing you to communicate *with any creature that can speak a language).

@node Arcane

Your family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic. While many of your relatives were accomplished wizards, your powers developed without the need for study and practice.

@strong{Class Skill}: @ref{#knowledge,Knowledge} (any one).

@strong{Bonus Spells}: @emph{[identify]} (3rd), @emph{[invisibility]} , @emph{[dispel magic]} , @emph{[dimension door]}, @emph{[overland flight]}, @emph{[true seeing]} , @emph{[greater teleport]} , @emph{[power word stun]} , @emph{[wish]} .

@strong{Bloodline Arcana}: Whenever you apply a [metamagic feat] to a spell that increases the slot used by at least one level, increase the spell's DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells modified by the [Heighten Spell] feat.

@strong{Bloodline Powers}: Magic comes naturally to you, but as you gain levels you must take care to prevent the power from overwhelming you.

@emph{Arcane Bond: At 1st level, you gain an [arcane bond], as a}wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels stack @emph{with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers}of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow @emph{you to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day,}your bond item allows you to cast any one of our spells known @emph{(unlike a wizard's bonded item, which allows him to cast any one}spell in his spellbook).

@emph{Metamagic Adept}: At 3rd level, you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell. You can use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 19th level. At 20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane apotheosis.

@emph{New Arcana}: At 9th level, you can add any one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to your list of spells known. This spell must be of a level that you are capable of casting. You can also add one additional spell at 13th level and 17th level.

@emph{School Power}: At 15th level, pick one school of magic. The DC for any spells you cast from that school increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by @ref{#spell-focus,Spell Focus}.

@emph{Arcane Apotheosis}: At 20th level, your body surges with arcane power. You can add any [metamagic feats] that you know to your spells without increasing their casting time, although you must still expend higher-level spell slots. Whenever you use magic items that require charges, you can instead expend spell slots to power the item. For every three levels of spell slots that you expend, you consume one less charge when using a magic item that expends charges.

@node Celestial
@subsubsection Celestial
@anchor{#celestial}

@emph{Heavenly Fire}: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. Against evil creatures, this ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. This damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. This ray heals good creatures of 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. A good creature cannot benefit from your heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are neither harmed nor healed by this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

@emph{Celestial Resistances}: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and resist cold 5. At 9th level, your resistances increase to 10.

@emph{Wings of Heaven}: At 9th level, you can sprout feathery wings and fly for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level, with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.

@emph{Conviction}: At 15th level, you can reroll any one ability check, attack roll, skill check, or [saving throw] you just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.

@strong{Bloodline Powers}: You are destined for great things, and the powers that you gain serve to protect you.

@emph{Touch of Destiny: At 1st level, you can touch a creature as}a standard action, giving it an insight bonus on attack rolls, @emph{[skill checks], ability checks, and [saving throws] equal to 1/2}your sorcerer level for 1 round.

@emph{It Was Meant To Be: At 9th level, you may reroll any one}attack roll, [critical hit] confirmation roll, or level check @emph{made to overcome spell resistance.

At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. *At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

@emph{Within Reach: At 15th level, your ultimate destiny is}drawing near. Once per day, when an attack or spell that causes @emph{damage would result in your death, you may attempt a DC 20 [Will *save]. If successful, you are instead reduced to --1 hit points}and are automatically stabilized. The bonus from your fated *ability applies to this save.

@emph{Destiny Realized: At 20th level, your moment of destiny is}at hand. Any critical threats made against you only confirm if @emph{the second roll results in a natural 20 on the die. Any critical}threats you score with a spell are automatically confirmed. Once @emph{per day, you can automatically succeed at one caster level check}made to overcome spell resistance. You must use this ability *before making the roll.

Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible---such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.

@strong{Role}: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.

@strong{Alignment}: Any.

@node Wizard Class Features
@subsubsection Wizard Class Features
@anchor{#wizard-class-features}
The following are the class features of the wizard.

@strong{Weapon and Armor Proficiency}: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a wizard's movements, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

@strong{Spells}: A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in @ref{#spell-lists,Spell Lists}. A wizard must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an [Intelligence] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a wizard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's [Intelligence] modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Wizard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high [Intelligence] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

@strong{Bonus Languages}: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

**Arcane Bond **: At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a [familiar] or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizard's skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed. Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for [familiars] are at the end of this section.

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a [concentration check] or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizard's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard's opposition schools .

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required [item creation feats] and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in @ref{#feats,Feats}). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object's owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

@strong{Arcane School}: A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a @emph{fireball}. In addition, a specialist takes a --4 penalty on any [skill checks] made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizard's spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the universalist school do not receive a school slot.

@strong{Cantrips:} Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of his available slots .

@strong{Scribe Scroll}: At 1st level, a wizard gains [Scribe Scroll] as a bonus feat.

@strong{Bonus Feats}: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a [metamagic feat], an [item creation feat], or @ref{#spell-mastery,Spell Mastery}. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.

@strong{Spellbooks}: A wizard must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for @emph{[read magic]}, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his [Intelligence] modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to his own.

@node Arcane Schools
@subsubsection Arcane Schools
@anchor{#arcane-schools}
The following descriptions detail each arcane school and its corresponding powers.

@node Abjuration School
@subsubsection Abjuration School
@anchor{#abjuration-school}
The abjurer uses magic against itself, and masters the art of defensive and warding magics.

@emph{Resistance}: You gain resistance 5 to an energy type of your choice, chosen when you prepare spells. This resistance can be changed each day. At 11th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, this resistance changes to immunity to the chosen energy type.

@emph{Protective Ward}: As a standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your [Intelligence] modifier. All allies in this area receive a +1 deflection bonus to their [AC]. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Energy Absorption}: At 6th level, you gain an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times your wizard level per day. Whenever you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount. Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.

@node Conjuration School
@subsubsection Conjuration School
@anchor{#conjuration-school}
The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic alike to bend to his will.

@emph{Summoner's Charm}: Whenever you cast a conjuration ([summoning]) spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level . At 20th level, you can change the duration of all @emph{summon monster} spells to permanent. You can have no more than one @emph{summon monster} spell made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another @emph{[summon monster]}spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.

@emph{Acid Dart}: As a standard action you can unleash an acid dart targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acid dart deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier. This attack ignores spell resistance.

@emph{Dimensional Steps}: At 8th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per wizard level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an [attack of opportunity]. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you.

@node Divination School
@subsubsection Divination School
@anchor{#divination-school}
Diviners are masters of remote viewing, prophecies, and using magic to explore the world.

@emph{Forewarned}: You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a @ref{#perception,Perception} roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered [flat-footed] until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 your wizard level . At 20th level, anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

@emph{Diviner's Fortune}: When you activate this school power, you can touch any creature as a standard action to give it an insight bonus on all of its attack rolls, [skill checks], ability checks, and [saving throws] equal to 1/2 your wizard level for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Scrying Adept}: At 8th level, you are always aware when you are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent @emph{[detect scrying]}. In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more familiar to you. Very familiar subjects get a --10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.

@node Enchantment School
@subsubsection Enchantment School
@anchor{#enchantment-school}
The enchanter uses magic to control and manipulate the minds of his victims.

@emph{Enchanting Smile}: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on @ref{#bluff,Bluff}, @ref{#diplomacy,Diplomacy}, and [Intimidate][skill checks]. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, up to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. At 20th level, whenever you succeed at a [saving throw] against a spell of the enchantment school, that spell is reflected back at its caster, as per @emph{[spell turning]}.

@emph{Dazing Touch}: You can cause a living creature to become [dazed] for 1 round as a melee touch attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Aura of Despair}: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of despair for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Enemies within this aura take a --2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, [saving throws], and [skill checks]. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting effect.

@node Evocation School
@subsubsection Evocation School
@anchor{#evocation-school}
Evokers revel in the raw power of magic, and can use it to create and destroy with shocking ease.

@emph{Intense Spells}: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add 1/2 your wizard level to the damage . This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is not increased by [Empower Spell] or similar effects. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At 20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll twice to penetrate a creature's spell resistance and take the better result.

@emph{Force Missile: As a standard action you can unleash a force}missile that automatically strikes a foe, as @emph{[magic *missile]}. The force missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the @emph{damage from your intense spells evocation power. This is a force}effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal *to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Elemental Wall}: At 8th level, you can create a wall of energy that lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This wall deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, determined when you create it. The elemental wall otherwise functions like @emph{[wall of fire]}.

@node Illusion School
@subsubsection Illusion School
@anchor{#illusion-school}
Illusionists use magic to weave confounding images, figments, and phantoms to baffle and vex their foes.

@emph{Extended Illusions}: Any illusion spell you cast with a duration of “concentration” lasts a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level after you stop maintaining concentration . At 20th level, you can make one illusion spell with a duration of “concentration” become permanent. You can have no more than one illusion made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another illusion as permanent, the previous permanent illusion ends.

@emph{Blinding Ray}: As a standard action you can fire a shimmering ray at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray causes creatures to be [blinded] for 1 round. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are [dazzled] for 1 round instead. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Invisibility Field}: At 8th level, you can make yourself [invisible] as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This otherwise functions as @emph{[greater invisibility].}

@node Necromancy School
@subsubsection Necromancy School
@anchor{#necromancy-school}
The dread and feared necromancer commands undead and uses the foul power of unlife against his enemies.

@emph{Power over Undead}: You receive @ref{#command-undead,Command Undead} or @ref{#turn-undead,Turn Undead} as a bonus feat. You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier, but only to use the selected feat. You can take other feats to add to this ability, such as @ref{#extra-channel,Extra Channel} and @ref{#improved-channel,Improved Channel}, but not feats that alter this ability, such as @ref{#elemental-channel,Elemental Channel} and Alignment[Channel]. The DC to save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your [Charisma] modifier. At 20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the save against this ability.

@emph{Grave Touch}: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that causes a living creature to become [shaken] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level . If you touch a [shaken] creature with this ability, it becomes [frightened] for 1 round if it has fewer Hit Dice than your wizard level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Life Sight}: At 8th level, you gain blindsight to a range of 10 feet for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. This ability only allows you to detect living creatures and undead creatures. This sight also tells you whether a creature is living or undead. Constructs and other creatures that are neither living nor undead cannot be seen with this ability. The range of this ability increases by 10 feet at 12th level, and by an additional 10 feet for every four levels beyond 12th. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

@node Transmutation School
@subsubsection Transmutation School
@anchor{#transmutation-school}
Transmuters use magic to change the world around them.

@emph{Physical Enhancement}: You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to one physical ability score ([Strength], [Dexterity], or [Constitution]). This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. You can change this bonus to a new ability score when you prepare spells. At 20th level, this bonus applies to two physical ability scores of your choice.

@emph{Telekinetic Fist}: As a standard action you can strike with a telekinetic fist, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The telekinetic fist deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Change Shape}: At 8th level, you can change your shape for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like @emph{[beast shape II]} or @emph{[elemental body I].} At 12th level, this ability functions like @emph{[beast shape III]} or @emph{[elemental body II]}.

@node Universalist School
@subsubsection Universalist School
@anchor{#universalist-school}
Wizards who do not specialize have the most diversity of all arcane spellcasters.

@emph{Hand of the Apprentice}: You cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe before instantly returning to you. As a standard action, you can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your [Intelligence] modifier on the attack roll instead of your [Dexterity] modifier (damage still relies on [Strength]). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

@emph{Metamagic Mastery}: At 8th level, you can apply any one [metamagic feat] that you know to a spell you are about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting time. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every two wizard levels you possess beyond 8th. Any time you use this ability to apply a metamagic feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you must use an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the feat adds to the spell. Even though this ability does not modify the spell's actual level, you cannot use this ability to cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level of the highest-level spell that you are capable of casting.

@node Familiars
@subsubsection Familiars
@anchor{#familiars}
A familiar is an animal chosen by a spellcaster to aid him in his study of magic. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but is now a magical beast for the purpose of effects that depend on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar grants special abilities to its master, as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master's level.

If a familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

Familiar

Special Ability

Bat

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#fly,Fly} checks

Cat

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#stealth,Stealth} checks

Hawk

Master gains a +3 bonus on sight-based and opposed @ref{#perception,Perception} checks in bright light

Lizard

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#climb,Climb} checks

Monkey

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics} checks

Owl

Master gains a +3 bonus on sight-based and opposed @ref{#perception,Perception} checks in shadows or darkness

Rat

Master gains a +2 bonus on [Fortitude saves]

Raven*

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#appraise,Appraise} checks

Viper

Master gains a +3 bonus on @ref{#bluff,Bluff} checks

Toad

Master gains +3 hit points

Weasel

Master gains a +2 bonus on [Reflex saves]

*A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice as a supernatural ability.

@strong{Familiar Basics}: Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar's kind, but with the following changes.

@emph{Hit Dice}: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher.

@emph{Hit Points}: The familiar has half the master's total hit points (not including [temporary hit points]), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

@emph{Attacks}: Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar's [Dexterity] or [Strength] modifier, whichever is greater, to calculate the familiar's melee attack bonus with natural weapons.

Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

@emph{Saving Throws}: For each [saving throw], use either the familiar's base save bonus ([Fortitude] +2, [Reflex] +2, [Will] +0) or the master's , whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

@emph{Skills}: For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever is better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use. Familiars treat @ref{#acrobatics,Acrobatics}, @ref{#climb,Climb}, @ref{#fly,Fly}, @ref{#perception,Perception}, @ref{#stealth,Stealth}, and @ref{#swim,Swim} as class skills.

@strong{Familiar Ability Descriptions}: All familiars have special abilities depending on the master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities are cumulative.

@emph{Natural Armor Adj.}: The number noted here is in addition to the familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

@emph{Int}: The familiar's [Intelligence] score.

@emph{Alertness}: While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the @ref{#alertness,Alertness} feat.

@emph{Improved Evasion}: When subjected to an attack that normally allows a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving throw] and half damage even if the [saving throw] fails.

@emph{Share Spells}: The wizard may cast a spell with a target of “You” on his familiar instead of on himself. A wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the familiar's type .

@emph{Empathic Link}: The master has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate empathically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link's limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

@emph{Deliver Touch Spells}: If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

@emph{Speak with Master}: If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

@emph{Speak with Animals of Its Kind}: If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by the [Intelligence] of the conversing creatures.

@emph{Spell Resistance}: If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level +5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check that equals or exceeds the familiar's spell resistance.

@emph{Scry on Familiar}: If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the @emph{scrying}spell) once per day.

@node Arcane Spells and Armor
@subsubsection Arcane Spells and Armor
@anchor{#arcane-spells-and-armor}
Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting any spell that has a somatic component. The [armor and shield descriptions] list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks still apply normally). The metamagic feat [Still Spell] allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell without the somatic component at one spell level higher than normal. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.

@strong{Dancing Lights}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} Up to four lights, all within a 10-ft.-radius area

@strong{Duration} 1 minute (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The @emph{dancing lights}must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

You can only have one @emph{dancing lights} spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit.

@emph{Dancing lights}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Darkness

@strong{Darkness}

@strong{School}evocation [darkness]; @strong{Level}bard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, M/DF (bat fur and a piece of coal)

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}object touched

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell causes an object to radiate darkness out to a 20-foot radius. This darkness causes the illumination level in the area to drop one step, from bright light to normal light, from normal light to dim light, or from dim light to darkness. This spell has no effect in an area that is already dark. Creatures with light vulnerability or sensitivity take no penalties in normal light. All creatures gain concealment (20% miss chance) in dim light. All creatures gain total concealment (50% miss chance) in darkness. Creatures with [darkvision] can see in an area of dim light or darkness without penalty. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in an area of darkness. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area if they are of a higher spell level than@emph{darkness}.

If @emph{darkness} is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.

This spell does not stack with itself. @emph{Darkness} can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

Darkvision

@strong{Darkvision}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject gains the ability to see 60 feet even in total darkness. @ref{#darkvision,Darkvision} is black and white only but otherwise like normal sight.

@emph{Darkvision}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

Daylight

@strong{Daylight}

@strong{School} evocation [light]; @strong{Level} bard 3, cleric 3, druid 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} object touched

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You touch an object when you cast this spell, causing the object to shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This illumination increases the light level for an additional 60 feet by one step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). Creatures that take penalties in bright light take them while within the 60-foot radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by such light.

If @emph{daylight}is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell's effects are blocked until the covering is removed.

@emph{Daylight}brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

@emph{Daylight}counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as @emph{darkness.}

Daze

@strong{Daze}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a pinch of wool or similar substance)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature of 4 HD or less

@strong{Duration} 1 round

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A [dazed] subject is not [stunned], so attackers get no special advantage against it. After a creature has been [dazed] by this spell, it is immune to the effects of this spell for 1 minute.

Daze Monster

@strong{Daze Monster}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target}one living creature of 6 HD or less

This spell functions like @emph{[daze],}but it can affect any one living creature of any type. Creatures of 7 or more HD are not affected.

Death Knell

@strong{Death Knell}

@strong{School} necromancy [death, evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous/10 minutes per HD of subject; see text

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has --1 or fewer hit points. If the subject fails its saving throw, it dies, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to [Strength]. Additionally, your effective caster level goes up by +1, improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level does not grant you access to more spells. These effects last for 10 minutes per HD of the subject creature.

Death Ward

@strong{Death Ward}

@strong{School}necromancy; @strong{Level}cleric 4, druid 5, paladin 4

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, DF

@strong{Range}touch

@strong{Target}living creature touched

@strong{Duration}1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to [energy drain] and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.

This spell does not remove [negative levels] that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from [negative levels] for the duration of its effect.

@emph{Death ward}does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.

Deathwatch

@strong{Deathwatch}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 30 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Using the powers of necromancy, you can determine the condition of creatures near death within the spell's range. You instantly know whether each creature within the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded, with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct). @emph{Deathwatch}sees through any spell or ability that allows creatures to feign death.

Deeper Darkness

@strong{Deeper Darkness}

@strong{School}evocation [darkness]; @strong{Level}cleric 3

@strong{Duration}10 min./level (D)

This spell functions as @emph{[darkness]}, except that objects radiate darkness in a 60-foot radius and the light level is lowered by two steps. Bright light becomes dim light and normal light becomes darkness. Areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark. This functions like darkness, but even creatures with [darkvision] cannot see within the spell's confines.

This spell does not stack with itself. @emph{Deeper darkness} can be used to counter or dispel any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

Deep Slumber

@strong{Deep Slumber}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

This spell functions like @emph{[sleep],}except that it affects 10 HD of targets.

Delayed Blast Fireball

@strong{Delayed Blast Fireball}

@strong{School} evocation [fire]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Duration} 5 rounds or less; see text

This spell functions like @emph{[fireball],}except that it is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The glowing bead created by @emph{delayed blast fireball}can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for as many as 5 rounds. You select the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and that time cannot change once it has been set unless someone touches the bead. If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while being handled.

Delay Poison

@strong{Delay Poison}

@strong{School} conjuration (healing); @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 hour/level

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. @emph{Delay poison}does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.

Demand

@strong{Demand}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell functions like @emph{[sending],}but the message can also contain a @emph{[suggestion]}(see the @emph{[suggestion]}spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful [Will] save negates the @emph{[suggestion]}effect but not the contact itself. The @emph{demand,}if received, is understood even if the subject's [Intelligence] score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the @emph{demand}is issued, the message is understood but the @emph{[suggestion]}is ineffective.

The @emph{demand}'s message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the @emph{[suggestion].}The creature can also give a short reply immediately.

Desecrate

@strong{Desecrate}

@strong{School} evocation [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Component} V, S, M (a vial of unholy water and 25 gp worth (5 pounds) of silver dust, all of which must be sprinkled around the area), DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation

@strong{Duration} 2 hours/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell imbues an area with negative energy. The DC to resist negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus. Every undead creature entering a @emph{desecrated}area gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. An undead creature created within or summoned into such an area gains +1 hit points per HD.

If the @emph{desecrated}area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your deity or aligned higher power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 profane bonus to negative channeled energy DCs, +2 profane bonus and +2 hit points per HD for undead created in the area).

Furthermore, anyone who casts @emph{[animate dead]}within this area may create as many as double the normal amount of undead (that is, 4 HD per caster level rather than 2 HD per caster level).

If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture of a deity, pantheon, or higher power other than your patron, the @emph{desecrate}spell instead curses the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

@emph{Desecrate}counters and dispels @emph{[consecrate]}.

Destruction

@strong{Destruction}

@strong{School}necromancy [death]; @strong{Level} cleric 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (holy or unholy symbol costing 500 gp)

@strong{Range}close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level. If the spell slays the target, it consumes the remains utterly in holy (or unholy) fire (but not its equipment or possessions). If the target's [Fortitude] saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore life to a character who has failed to save against this spell (and was slain) is to use @emph{[true resurrection]}, a carefully worded @emph{[wish]} spell followed by @emph{[resurrection]}, or @emph{[miracle]}.

Detect Animals or Plants

@strong{Detect Animals or Plants}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can detect a particular kind of animal or plant in a cone emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a kind of animal or plant when using the spell, but you can change the animal or plant kind each round. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific kind of animal or plant.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of that kind of animal or plant in the area.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of individuals of the specified kind in the area and the condition of the healthiest specimen.

@emph{3rd Round}: The condition (see below) and location of each individual present. If an animal or a plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

@emph{Conditions}: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:

Normal: Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of disease.

Fair: 30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining.

Poor: Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.

Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or crippled.

If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two.

Each round you can turn to detect a kind of animal or plant in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Chaos

@strong{Detect Chaos}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 1

This spell functions like @emph{[detect evil]}, except that it detects the auras of chaotic creatures, clerics of chaotic deities, chaotic spells, and chaotic magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming chaotic aura if you are lawful.

Detect Evil

@strong{Detect Evil}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Component} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 10 min./ level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of evil.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present.

If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura's power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura's source is at least twice your character level, you are [stunned] for 1 round and the spell ends.

@emph{3rd Round}: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

@emph{Aura Power}: An evil aura's power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level; see the table below. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.

@emph{Lingering Aura}: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If @emph{[detect evil]}is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Creatures with actively evil intents count as evil creatures for the purpose of this spell.

Each round, you can turn to [detect evil] in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Good

@strong{Detect Good}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 1

This spell functions like @emph{[detect evil]}, except that it detects the auras of good creatures, clerics or paladins of good deities, good spells, and good magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming good aura if you are evil.

Detect Law

@strong{Detect Law}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 1

This spell functions like @emph{[detect evil]}, except that it detects the auras of lawful creatures, clerics of lawful deities, lawful spells, and lawful magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming lawful aura if you are chaotic.

Detect Magic

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of magical auras.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

@emph{3rd Round}: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura eminates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

@emph{Aura Strength}: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, @emph{detect magic}indicates the stronger of the two.

@emph{Lingering Aura}: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If @emph{detect magic}is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura).

Detect Poison

@strong{Detect Poison}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target or Area} one creature, one object, or a 5-ft. cube

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 [Wisdom] check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the [Wisdom] check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the [Wisdom] check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Scrying

@strong{Detect Scrying}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (a piece of mirror and a miniature brass hearing trumpet)

@strong{Range} 40 ft.

@strong{Area} 40-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

@strong{Duration} 24 hours

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You immediately become aware of any attempt to observe you by means of a divination (scrying) spell or effect. The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the location of every magical sensor within the spell's area.

If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level). If you at least match the scrier's result, you get a visual image of the scrier and an accurate sense of his direction and distance from you.

Detect Secret Doors

@strong{Detect Secret Doors}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of secret doors.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

@emph{Each Additional Round}: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Snares and Pits

@strong{Detect Snares and Pits}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} druid 1, ranger 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

@emph{Detect snares and pits}does detect certain natural hazards---quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). It does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not [detect magic] traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell @emph{[snare]}), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of hazards.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

@emph{Each Additional Round}: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to examine a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Thoughts

@strong{Detect Thoughts}

@strong{School} divination [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F/DF (a copper piece)

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with [Intelligence] scores of 1 or higher).

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of thinking minds and the [Intelligence] score of each. If the highest [Intelligence] is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own [Intelligence] score), you are [stunned] for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.

@emph{3rd Round}: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's [Will] save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast @emph{detect thoughts}again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence ([Int] 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.

Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect Undead

@strong{Detect Undead}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (earth from a grave)

@strong{Range} 60 ft.

@strong{Area} cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 minute/ level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can detect the aura that surrounds undead creatures. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

@emph{1st Round}: Presence or absence of undead auras.

@emph{2nd Round}: Number of undead auras in the area and the strength of the strongest undead aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest undead aura's strength is overwhelming (see below), and the creature has HD of at least twice your character level, you are [stunned] for 1 round and the spell ends.

@emph{3rd Round}: The strength and location of each undead aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

@emph{Aura Strength}: The strength of an undead aura is determined by the HD of the undead creature, as given on the table below.

@emph{Lingering Aura}: An undead aura lingers after its original source is destroyed. If @emph{detect undead}is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power, as given on the table below.

@multitable {11 or higher} {Overwhelming} {Lingering Aura Duration}

Each round, you can turn to detect undead in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Dictum

@strong{Dictum}

@strong{School} evocation [lawful, sonic]; @strong{Level} cleric 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} 40 ft.

@strong{Area} nonlawful creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none or [Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Any nonlawful creature within the area of a @emph{dictum}spell suffers the following ill effects.

@multitable {Up to caster level --10} {Killed, [paralyzed], [staggered], [deafened]} 
@headitem 
HD

 @tab [Paralyzed], [staggered], [deafened]
@item 
Up to caster level --10
 @tab Killed, [paralyzed], [staggered], [deafened]
@end multitable

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

@emph{Deafened}: The creature is [deafened] for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.

@emph{Staggered}: The creature is [staggered] for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces the [staggered] effect to 1d4 rounds.

@emph{[Paralyzed]}: The creature is [paralyzed] and [helpless] for 1d10 minutes. Save reduces the [paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

@emph{Killed}: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the @emph{dictum}or not@emph{.}The banishment effect allows a [Will] save (at a --4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by @emph{dictum.}

Dimensional Anchor

@strong{Dimensional Anchor}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (object)

A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a @emph{dimensional anchor}include @emph{[astral projection], blink, [dimension door], [ethereal jaunt], [etherealness], [gate], [maze], [plane shift], [shadow walk], [teleport],}and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a @emph{gate}or @emph{[teleportation circle]}for the duration of the spell.

A @emph{dimensional anchor}does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, @emph{dimensional anchor}does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Dimensional Lock

@strong{Dimensional Lock}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred include @emph{[astral projection], blink, [dimension door], [ethereal jaunt], [etherealness], [gate], [maze], [plane shift], [shadow walk], [teleport],}and similar spell-like abilities. Once @emph{dimensional lock}is in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the area is not possible.

A @emph{dimensional lock}does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Dimension Door

@strong{Dimension Door}

@strong{School} conjuration (teleportation); @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Target} you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none and [Will] negates (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no and yes (object)

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired---whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.

Diminish Plants

@strong{Diminish Plants}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 3, ranger 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target or Area} see text

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell has two versions.

@emph{Prune Growth}: This version of the spell causes normal vegetation within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed. This version of @emph{diminish plants} automatically dispels any spells or effects that enhance plants, such as @emph{[entangle], [plant growth],}and @emph{[wall of thorns]}.

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle. You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.

@emph{Stunt Growth}: This version of the spell targets all normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to half normal.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

Discern Lies

@strong{Discern Lies}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 4, paladin 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Targets} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} concentration, up to 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

Each round, you concentrate on one target, who must be within range. You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions.

Each round, you may concentrate on a different target.

Discern Location

@strong{Discern Location}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} unlimited

@strong{Target} one creature or object

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

A @emph{discern location}spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a @emph{[mind blank]}spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. @emph{Discern location}circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.

To find a creature with the spell, you must have seen the creature or have some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have touched it at least once.

Disguise Self

@strong{Disguise Self}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

You make yourself---including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment---look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type (although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person or gender.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a [Will] save to recognize it as an illusion.

Disintegrate

@strong{Disintegrate}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial (object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.

When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as @emph{[forceful hand]}or a @emph{[wall of force]}, but not magical effects such as a @emph{[globe of invulnerability]}or an @emph{[antimagic field].}

A creature or object that makes a successful [Fortitude] save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.

Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

Dismissal

@strong{Dismissal}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one extraplanar creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a [Will] save. If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.

Dispel Chaos

@strong{Dispel Chaos}

@strong{School} abjuration [lawful]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, paladin 4

This spell functions like @emph{[dispel evil]}, except that you are surrounded by constant, blue lawful energy, and the spell affects chaotic creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Evil

@strong{Dispel Evil}

@strong{School} abjuration [good]; @strong{Level} cleric 5, paladin 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target or Targets} you and a touched evil creature from another plane, or you and an enchantment or evil spell on a touched creature or object

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level or until discharged, whichever comes first

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} see text

Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects.

First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful [Will] save ([spell resistance] applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by @emph{[dispel magic]}also can't be dispelled by @emph{dispel evil}. Saving throws and [spell resistance] do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.

Dispel Good

@strong{Dispel Good}

@strong{School} abjuration [evil]; @strong{Level} cleric 5

This spell functions like @emph{[dispel evil]}, except that you are surrounded by dark, wavering unholy energy, and the spell affects good creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Law

@strong{Dispel Law}

@strong{School} abjuration [chaotic]; @strong{Level} cleric 5

This spell functions like @emph{[dispel evil]}, except that you are surrounded by flickering, yellow chaotic energy, and the spell affects lawful creatures and spells rather than evil ones.

Dispel Magic

@strong{Dispel Magic}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 3, cleric 3, druid 4, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target or Area} one spellcaster, creature, or object

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You can use @emph{dispel magic}to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by @emph{dispel magic}. @emph{Dispel magic}can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the @emph{dispel magic}can take effect.

You choose to use @emph{dispel magic}in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.

@emph{Targeted Dispel}: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the @emph{dispel magic}spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.

For example, a 7th-level caster casts @emph{dispel magic}, targeting a creature affected by @emph{[stoneskin]}(caster level 12th) and @emph{fly} (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the @emph{[stoneskin]} (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the @emph{fly} (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the @emph{[stoneskin]} would have been dispelled, leaving the @emph{fly}intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.

You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a @emph{[wall of fire]}). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by @emph{summon monster}), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a @emph{bag of holding}) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.

@emph{Counterspell}: When @emph{dispel magic}is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, @emph{dispel magic}may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

@strong{Dispel Magic, Greater}

@strong{School} abjuration; @strong{Level} bard 5, cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Target or Area} one spellcaster, creature, or object; or a 20-ft.-radius burst

This spell functions like @emph{[dispel magic]}, except that it can end more than one spell on a target and it can be used to target multiple creatures.

You choose to use @emph{greater dispel magic}in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, area dispel, or a counterspell:

@emph{Targeted Dispel}: This functions as a targeted @emph{[dispel magic]}, but it can dispel one spell for every four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells.

Additionally, @emph{greater dispel magic}has a chance to dispel any effect that @emph{[remove curse]}can remove, even if @emph{[dispel magic]}can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.

@emph{Area Dispel}: When @emph{greater dispel magic}is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by @emph{[dispel magic]}. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the @emph{greater dispel magic}spell, apply the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the @emph{greater dispel magic}spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by @emph{summon monster}) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.

@emph{Counterspell}: This functions as @emph{[dispel magic],}but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Displacement

@strong{Displacement}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, M (a small loop of leather)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, @emph{displacement}does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. @emph{[True seeing]}reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.

Disrupting Weapon

@strong{Disrupting Weapon}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Targets} one melee weapon

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless, object); see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless, object)

This spell makes a melee weapon deadly to undead. Any undead creature with HD equal to or less than your caster level must succeed on a [Will] save or be destroyed utterly if struck in combat with this weapon. [Spell resistance] does not apply against the destruction effect.

Disrupt Undead

@strong{Disrupt Undead}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 0

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Effect} ray

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You direct a ray of positive energy. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit, and if the ray hits an undead creature, it deals 1d6 points of damage to it.

Divination

@strong{Divination}

@strong{School} divination; @strong{Level} cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 10 minutes

@strong{Components} V, S, M (incense and an appropriate offering worth 25 gp)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

Similar to @emph{[augury]}but more powerful, a @emph{divination}spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct @emph{divination}is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

As with @emph{[augury]}, multiple @emph{divinations}about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first @emph{divination}spell and yield the same answer each time.

Divine Favor

@strong{Divine Favor}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level} cleric 1, paladin 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 minute

Calling upon the strength and wisdom of a deity, you gain a +1 luck bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). The bonus doesn't apply to spell damage.

Divine Power

@strong{Divine Power}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level}cleric 4

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

Calling upon the divine power of your patron, you imbue yourself with strength and skill in combat. You gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, [Strength] checks, and [Strength]-based skill checks for every three caster levels you have (maximum +6). You also gain 1 temporary hit point per caster level. Whenever you make a full-attack action, you can make an additional attack at your full base attack bonus, plus any appropriate modifiers. This additional attack is not cumulative with similar effects, such as @emph{[haste]} or weapons with the @emph{speed} special ability.

Dominate Animal

@strong{Dominate Animal}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} druid 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one animal

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell allows you to enchant the targeted animal and direct it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature two or more size categories larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.

@emph{Dominate animal}establishes a mental link between you and the subject creature. The animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains in range. You need not see the creature to control it. You do not receive direct sensory input from the creature, but you know what it is experiencing. Because you are directing the animal with your own intelligence, it may be able to undertake actions normally beyond its own comprehension. You need not concentrate exclusively on controlling the creature unless you are trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't do. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.

Dominate Monster

@strong{Dominate Monster}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Target} one creature

This spell functions like @emph{[dominate person],}except that the spell is not restricted by creature type.

Dominate Person

@strong{Dominate Person}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one humanoid

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.

If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “Come here,” “Go there,” “Fight,” and “Stand still.” You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically.

Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).

Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action.

By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.

Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the subject to control it.

If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the domination.

@emph{[Protection from evil]}or a similar spell can prevent you from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so warded, but such an effect does not automatically dispel it.

Doom

@strong{Doom}

@strong{School} necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell fills a single subject with a feeling of horrible dread that causes it to become [shaken].

You, or a messenger you touch, send a message to others in the form of a dream. At the beginning of the spell, you must name the recipient or identify him or her by some title that leaves no doubt as to identity. The messenger then enters a trance, appears in the intended recipient's dream, and delivers the message. The message can be of any length, and the recipient remembers it perfectly upon waking. The communication is one-way. The recipient cannot ask questions or offer information, nor can the messenger gain any information by observing the dreams of the recipient.

Once the message is delivered, the messenger's mind returns instantly to its body. The duration of the spell is the time required for the messenger to enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message.

If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, the messenger can choose to wake up (ending the spell) or remain in the trance. The messenger can remain in the trance until the recipient goes to sleep, then enter the recipient's dream and deliver the message as normal. A messenger that is disturbed during the trance comes awake, ending the spell.

Creatures who don't sleep or don't dream cannot be contacted by this spell.

The messenger is unaware of its own surroundings or of the activities around it while in the trance. It is defenseless both physically and mentally (always failing any saving throw) while in the trance.

@node Special Abilities
@chapter Special Abilities
@anchor{#special-abilities-1}
The following special abilities include rules commonly used by a number of creatures, spells, and traps.

@strong{Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)}: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that suppress or negate magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.

@strong{Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)}: Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and @emph{dispel magic}. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an @emph{antimagic field}). Spell-like abilities can be dispelled but they cannot be counterspelled or used to counterspell.

@strong{Supernatural Abilities (Su)}: Supernatural abilities are magical but not spell-like. Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an @emph{antimagic field}). A supernatural ability's effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See Table: Special Ability Types for a summary of the types of special abilities.

@emph{Attack of Opportunity}: Does using the ability provoke attacks of opportunity the way that casting a spell does?

@* ## Ability Score Bonuses

Some spells and abilities increase your ability scores. Ability score increases with a duration of 1 day or less give only temporary bonuses. For every two points of increase to a single ability, apply a +1 bonus to the skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability.

@strong{[Strength]}: Temporary increases to your [Strength] score give you a bonus on [Strength]-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on [Strength]). The bonus also applies to your [Combat Maneuver Bonus] (if you are Small or larger) and to your [Combat Maneuver Defense].

@strong{[Dexterity]}: Temporary increases to your [Dexterity] score give you a bonus on [Dexterity]-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and [Reflex] saving throws. The bonus also applies to your @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, your [Combat Maneuver Bonus] (if you are Tiny or smaller), and your [Combat Maneuver Defense].

@strong{[Constitution]}: Temporary increases to your [Constitution] score give you a bonus on your [Fortitude] saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this bonus and add that amount to your current and total [hit points]. When the bonus ends, remove this total from your current and total [hit points].

@strong{[Intelligence]}: Temporary increases to your [Intelligence] score give you a bonus on [Intelligence]-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on [Intelligence].

@strong{[Wisdom]}: Temporary increases to your [Wisdom] score give you a bonus on [Wisdom]-based skill checks and [Will] saving throws. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on [Wisdom].

@strong{[Charisma]}: Temporary increases to your [Charisma] score give you a bonus on [Charisma]-based skill checks. This bonus also applies to any spell DCs based on [Charisma] and the DC to resist your channeled energy.

@strong{Permanent Bonuses}: Ability bonuses with a duration greater than 1 day actually increase the relevant ability score after 24 hours. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to gain skill points, [hit points], and other bonuses. These bonuses should be noted separately in case they are removed.

@node Ability Score Damage Penalty and Drain
@section Ability Score Damage, Penalty, and Drain
@anchor{#ability-score-damage-penalty-and-drain}
Diseases, poisons, spells, and other abilities can all deal damage directly to your ability scores. This damage does not actually reduce an ability, but it does apply a penalty to the skills and statistics that are based on that ability.

For every 2 points of damage you take to a single ability, apply a --1 penalty to skills and statistics listed with the relevant ability. If the amount of ability damage you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall unconscious until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your [Constitution] score. If the damage to your [Constitution] is equal to or greater than your [Constitution] score, you die. Unless otherwise noted, damage to your ability scores is healed at the rate of 1 per day to each ability score that has been damaged. Ability damage can be healed through the use of spells, such as @emph{[lesser restoration]}.

Some spells and abilities cause you to take an ability penalty for a limited amount of time. While in effect, these penalties function just like ability damage, but they cannot cause you to fall unconscious or die. In essence, penalties cannot decrease your ability score to less than 1.

@strong{[Strength]}: Damage to your [Strength] score causes you to take penalties on [Strength]-based skill checks, melee attack rolls, and weapon damage rolls (if they rely on [Strength]). The penalty also applies to your [Combat Maneuver Bonus] (if you are Small or larger) and your [Combat Maneuver Defense].

@strong{[Dexterity]}: Damage to your [Dexterity] score causes you to take penalties on [Dexterity]-based skill checks, ranged attack rolls, initiative checks, and [Reflex] saving throws. The penalty also applies to your @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, your [Combat Maneuver Bonus] (if you are Tiny or smaller), and to your [Combat Maneuver Defense].

@strong{[Constitution]}: Damage to your [Constitution] score causes you to take penalties on your [Fortitude] saving throws. In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total [hit points]. Lost [hit points] are restored when the damage to your [Constitution] is healed.

@strong{[Intelligence]}: Damage to your [Intelligence] score causes you to take penalties on [Intelligence]-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on [Intelligence].

@strong{[Wisdom]}: Damage to your [Wisdom] score causes you to take penalties on [Wisdom]-based skill checks and [Will] saving throws. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on [Wisdom].

@strong{[Charisma]}: Damage to your [Charisma] score causes you to take penalties on [Charisma]-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based off [Charisma] and the DC to resist your channeled energy.

@strong{Ability Drain}: Ability drain actually reduces the relevant ability score. Modify all skills and statistics related to that ability. This might cause you to lose skill points, [hit points], and other bonuses. Ability drain can be healed through the use of spells such as @emph{[restoration].}

@node Afflictions
@section Afflictions
@anchor{#afflictions}
From curses to poisons to diseases, there are a number of afflictions that can affect a creature. While each of these afflictions has a different effect, they all function using the same basic system. All afflictions grant a saving throw when they are contracted. If successful, the creature does not suffer from the affliction and does not need to make any further rolls. If the saving throw is a failure, the creature falls victim to the affliction and must deal with its effects.

Afflictions require a creature to make a saving throw after a period of time to avoid taking certain penalties. With most afflictions, if a number of saving throws are made consecutively, the affliction is removed and no further saves are necessary. Some afflictions, usually supernatural ones, cannot be cured through saving throws alone and require the aid of powerful magic to remove. Each affliction is presented as a short block of information to help you better adjudicate its results.

@strong{Name}: This is the name of the affliction.

@strong{Type}: This is the type of the affliction, such as curse, disease, or poison. It might also include the means by which it is contracted, such as contact, ingestion, inhalation, injury, spell, or trap.

@strong{Save}: This gives the type of save necessary to avoid contracting the affliction, as well as the DC of that save. Unless otherwise noted, this is also the save to avoid the affliction's effects once it is contracted, as well as the DC of any caster level checks needed to end the affliction through magic, such as @emph{[remove curse]} or @emph{[neutralize poison]}.

@strong{Onset}: Some afflictions have a variable amount of time before they set in. Creatures that come in contact with an affliction with an onset time must make a saving throw immediately. Success means that the affliction is avoided and no further saving throws must be made. Failure means that the creature has contracted the affliction and must begin making additional saves after the onset period has elapsed. The affliction's effect does not occur until after the onset period has elapsed and then only if further saving throws are failed.

@strong{Frequency}: This is how often the periodic saving throw must be attempted after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of “1/day” lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of “1/round for 6 rounds” ends after 6 rounds have passed.

Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time if one is listed).

@strong{Effect}: This is the effect that the character suffers each time if he fails his saving throw against the affliction. Most afflictions cause ability damage or hit point damage. These effects are cumulative, but they can be cured normally. Other afflictions cause the creature to take penalties or other effects. These effects are sometimes cumulative, with the rest only affecting the creature if it failed its most recent save. Some afflictions have different effects after the first save is failed. These afflictions have an initial effect, which occurs when the first save is failed, and a secondary effect, when additional saves are failed, as noted in the text. Hit point and ability score damage caused by an affliction cannot be healed naturally while the affliction persists.

@strong{Cure}: This tells you how the affliction is cured. Commonly, this is a number of saving throws that must be made consecutively. Even if the affliction has a limited frequency, it might be cured prematurely if enough saving throws are made. Hit point damage and ability score damage is not removed when an affliction is cured. Such damage must be healed normally. Afflictions without a cure entry can only be cured through powerful spells, such as @emph{[neutralize poison]} and @emph{[remove curse]}. No matter how many saving throws are made, these afflictions continue to affect the target.

He failed a DC 15 [Fortitude] save to avoid contracting it, so after the onset period of 1d3 days has passed, he must make another DC 15 [Fortitude] save to avoid taking 1d6 points of [Strength] damage. From this point onward, he must make a DC 15 [Fortitude] save each day (according to the disease's frequency) to avoid further [Strength] damage. If, on two consecutive days, he makes his [Fortitude] saves, he is cured of the disease and any damage it caused begins to heal as normal.

@node Curses
@section Curses
@anchor{#curses}
Careless rogues plundering a tomb, drunken heroes insulting a powerful wizard, and foolhardy adventurers who pick up ancient swords all might suffer from curses. These magic afflictions can have a wide variety of effects, from a simple penalty to certain checks to transforming the victim into a toad. Some even cause the afflicted to slowly rot away, leaving nothing behind but dust. Unlike other afflictions, most curses cannot be cured through a number of successful saving throws. Curses can be cured through magic, however, usually via spells such as @emph{[remove curse]} and @emph{break enchantment}. While some curses cause a progressive deterioration, others inflict a static penalty from the moment they are contracted, neither fading over time nor growing worse. In addition, there are a number of magic items that act like curses. See [Magic Items] for a description of these cursed items.

The following samples present just some of the possibilities when creating curses.

@strong{Baleful Polymorph Spell}

@node Diseases
@section Diseases
@anchor{#diseases}
From a widespread plague to the bite of a dire rat, disease is a serious threat to common folk and adventurers alike. Diseases rarely have a limited frequency, but most have a lengthy onset time. This onset time can also be variable. Most diseases can be cured by a number of consecutive saving throws or by spells such as @emph{[remove disease]}.

@node Poison
@section Poison
@anchor{#poison}
No other affliction is so prevalent as poison. From the fangs of a viper to the ichor-stained assassin's blade, poison is a constant threat. Poisons can be cured by successful saving throws and spells such as @emph{[neutralize poison]}.

Contact poisons are contracted the moment someone touches the poison with his bare skin. Such poisons can be used as injury poisons. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 minute and a frequency of 1 minute. Ingested poisons are contracted when a creature eats or drinks the poison. Ingested poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes and a frequency of 1 minute. Injury poisons are primarily contracted through the attacks of certain creatures and through weapons coated in the toxin. Injury poisons do not usually have an onset time and have a frequency of 1 round. Inhaled poisons are contracted the moment a creature enters an area containing such poisons. Most inhaled poisons fill a volume equal to a 10-foot cube per dose. Creatures can attempt to hold their breaths while inside to avoid inhaling the toxin. Creatures holding their breaths receive a 50% chance of not having to make a [Fortitude] save each round. See the rules for holding your breath and suffocation in [Environment]. Note that a character that would normally suffocate while attempting to hold its breath instead begins to breathe normally again.

Unlike other afflictions, multiple doses of the same poison stack. Poisons delivered by injury and contact cannot inflict more than one dose of poison at a time, but inhaled and ingested poisons can inflict multiple doses at once. Each additional dose extends the total duration of the poison (as noted under frequency) by half its total duration. In addition, each dose of poison increases the DC to resist the poison by +2. This increase is cumulative. Multiple doses do not alter the cure conditions of the poison, and meeting these conditions ends the affliction for all the doses. For example, a character is bit three times in the same round by a trio of Medium monstrous spiders, injecting him with three doses of Medium spider venom. The unfortunate character must make a DC 18 [Fortitude] save for the next 8 rounds. Fortunately, just one successful save cures the character of all three doses of the poison.

Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action. Whenever a character applies or readies a poison for use there is a 5% chance that he exposes himself to the poison and must save against the poison as normal. This does not consume the dose of poison. Whenever a character attacks with a poisoned weapon, if the attack roll results in a natural 1, he exposes himself to the poison. This consumes the poison on the weapon. Characters with the poison use class feature do not risk accidentally poisoning themselves.

Poisons can be made using @ref{#craft,Craft} (alchemy). The DC to make a poison is equal to its [Fortitude] save DC. Rolling a natural 1 on a @ref{#craft,Craft} skill check while making a poison exposes the crafter to the poison. Crafters with the poison use class feature do not risk poisoning themselves when using @ref{#craft,Craft} to make poison.

The following samples represent just some of the possibilities when creating poisons.

@node Blindsight and Blindsense
@section Blindsight and Blindsense
@anchor{#blindsight-and-blindsense}
Some creatures possess blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a nonvisual sense (or a combination senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such senses may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This makes invisibility and concealment (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can't see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description.

@itemize
@item
Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.
@item
Blindsight does not subject a creature to gaze attacks (even though darkvision does).
@item
Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures that use blindsight.
@item
Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.
@item
Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.
@item
Blindsight negates displacement and blur effects.
@end itemize

@strong{Blindsense}: Other creatures have blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make @ref{#perception,Perception} checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent that cannot be seen has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its [Dexterity] bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

@node Channel Resistance
@section Channel Resistance
@anchor{#channel-resistance}
Creatures with channel resistance gain a bonus on [Will] saves made against channeled energy. They add their bonus to any [Will] saves made to halve the damage and resist the effect.

@node Charm and Compulsion
@section Charm and Compulsion
@anchor{#charm-and-compulsion}
Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend from foe---or worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.

Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the various @emph{[charm]}spells and some monster abilities. Essentially, a @emph{charmed}character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.

@itemize
@item
A charmed creature doesn't gain any magical ability to understand his new friend's language.
@item
A charmed character retains his original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the charming creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.
@item
A charmed character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a fight with an actual friend).
@item
A charmed character is entitled to an opposed [Charisma] check against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn't normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains charmed@emph{.}
@item
A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to him. - If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the influenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the influence altogether.
@item
A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who charmed him or by that creature's apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.
@end itemize

Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject's free will in some way or simply changes the way the subject's mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the caster.

Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he does not volunteer information or tactics that his master doesn't ask for.

@node Damage Reduction
@section Damage Reduction
@anchor{#damage-reduction}
Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.

The numerical part of a creature's damage reduction (or DR) is the amount of damage the creature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction (see Overcoming DR). This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/magic means that a creature takes 5 less points of damage from all weapons that are not magic. If a dash follows the slash, then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction.

Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury poison, a monk's stunning, and injury-based disease. Damage reduction does not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.

Attacks that deal no damage because of the target's damage reduction do not disrupt spells.

Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage reduction.

Sometimes damage reduction represents instant healing. Sometimes it represents the creature's tough hide or body. In either case, other characters can see that conventional attacks won't work.

If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.

@strong{Overcoming DR}: Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).

Weapons with an enhancement bonus of +3 or greater can ignore some types of damage reduction, regardless of their actual material or alignment. The following table shows what type of enhancement bonus is needed to overcome some common types of damage reduction.

DR Type

Weapon Enhancement Bonus Equivalent

cold iron/silver

+3

adamantine*

+4

alignment-based

+5

* Note that this does not give the ability to ignore hardness, like an actual adamantine weapon does

@node Darkvision
@section Darkvision
@anchor{#darkvision}
Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black-and-white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise---invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.

@node Death Attacks
@section Death Attacks
@anchor{#death-attacks}
In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a [Fortitude] save to avoid the effect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.

@itemize
@item
@emph{[Raise dead]}doesn't work on someone killed by a death attack or effect.
@item
Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made stable and thereby kept alive.
@item
In case it matters, a dead character, no matter how he died, has [hit points] equal to or less than his negative [Constitution] score.
@item
The spell @emph{[death ward]}protects against these attacks.
@end itemize

@node Energy Drain and Negative Levels
@section Energy Drain and Negative Levels
@anchor{#energy-drain-and-negative-levels}
Some spells and a number of undead creatures have the ability to drain away life and energy; this dreadful attack results in “negative levels.” These cause a character to take a number of penalties.

For each negative level a creature has, it takes a cumulative --1 penalty on all ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, [Combat Maneuver Defense], saving throws, and skill checks. In addition, the creature reduces its current and total [hit points] by 5 for each negative level it possesses. The creature is also treated as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent variables (such as spellcasting) for each negative level possessed. Spellcasters do not lose any prepared spells or slots as a result of negative levels. If a creature's negative levels equal or exceed its total Hit Dice, it dies.

A creature with temporary negative levels receives a new saving throw to remove the negative level each day. The DC of this save is the same as the effect that caused the negative levels.

Some abilities and spells (such as @emph{[raise dead]}) bestow permanent level drain on a creature. These are treated just like temporary negative levels, but they do not allow a new save each day to remove them. Level drain can be removed through spells like @emph{restoration}. Permanent negative levels remain after a dead creature is restored to life. A creature whose permanent negative levels equal its Hit Dice cannot be brought back to life through spells like @emph{[raise dead]} and @emph{[resurrection]} without also receiving a @emph{[restoration]}spell, cast the round after it is restored to life.

@node Energy Immunity and Vulnerability
@section Energy Immunity and Vulnerability
@anchor{#energy-immunity-and-vulnerability}
A creature with energy immunity never takes damage from that energy type. Vulnerability means the creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from that energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed or if the save is a success or failure.

@node Energy Resistance
@section Energy Resistance
@anchor{#energy-resistance}
A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type per attack, but it does not have total immunity.

Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are resisted. It doesn't matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.

When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spell might provide.

@node Fear
@section Fear
@anchor{#fear}
Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. In most cases, the character makes a [Will] saving throw to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened, or panicked.

@strong{Shaken}: Characters who are shaken take a --2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

@strong{Frightened}: Characters who are frightened are shaken, and in addition they flee from the source of their fear as quickly as they can. They can choose the paths of their flight. Other than that stipulation, once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the source of their fear, they can act as they want. If the duration of their fear continues, however, characters can be forced to flee if the source of their fear presents itself again. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they are still shaken).

@strong{Panicked}: Characters who are panicked are shaken, and they run away from the source of their fear as quickly as they can, dropping whatever they are holding. Other than running away from the source, their paths are random. They flee from all other dangers that confront them rather than facing those dangers. Once they are out of sight (or hearing) of any source of danger, they can act as they want. Panicked characters cower if they are prevented from fleeing.

@strong{Becoming Even More Fearful}: Fear effects are cumulative. A shaken character who is made shaken again becomes frightened, and a shaken character who is made frightened becomes panicked instead. A frightened character who is made shaken or frightened becomes panicked instead.

@node Invisibility
@section Invisibility
@anchor{#invisibility}
The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can't be seen, invisible creatures can be heard, smelled, or felt.

Invisibility makes a creature undetectable by vision, including darkvision.

Invisibility does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune to extra damage from being a ranger's favored enemy and from sneak attacks.

A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 @ref{#perception,Perception} check. The observer gains a hunch that “something's there” but can't see it or target it accurately with an attack. It's practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature's location with a @ref{#perception,Perception} check. Even once a character has pinpointed the square that contains an invisible creature, the creature still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance). There are a number of modifiers that can be applied to this DC if the invisible creature is moving or engaged in a noisy activity.

A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature's current location. If the invisible creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.

If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck knows the location of the creature that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.

If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and slow invisible creature might get a smaller miss chance.

If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If the enemy's not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there and tell him that the character has missed, regardless of the result. That way the player doesn't know whether the attack missed because the enemy's not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.

If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. An invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. One could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour falls off or blows away).

Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature's location.

An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however, is still hard to see and benefits from concealment.

A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.

A creature with the [Blind-Fight] feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)

A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of invisibility.

An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a @emph{[light]} or similar spell cast upon it.

Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, @ref{#perception,Perception} checks, scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don't help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don't help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but @ref{#perception,Perception} checks can help.

Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.

Invisibility does not thwart divination spells.

Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even when invisible.

@node Low-Light Vision
@section Low-Light Vision
@anchor{#low-light-vision}
Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to him as a source of light.

Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

@node Paralysis
@section Paralysis
@anchor{#paralysis}
Some monsters and spells have the supernatural or spell-like ability to paralyze their victims, immobilizing them through magical means. Paralysis from poison is discussed in the [Afflictions section].

A paralyzed character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no components.

A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.

@node Scent
@section Scent
@anchor{#scent}
This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

A creature with the scent ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at three times these ranges.

The creature detects another creature's presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a move action. If the creature moves within 5 feet (1 square) of the scent's source, the creature can pinpoint the area that the source occupies, even if it cannot be seen.

A creature with the @ref{#survival,Survival} skill and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a @ref{#survival,Survival} check to find or follow a track. A creature with the scent ability can attempt to follow tracks using @ref{#survival,Survival} untrained. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the @ref{#survival,Survival} skill in regards to tracking. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the scent ability, however, can use it in the water easily.

False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base Survival DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.

@node Spell Resistance
@section Spell Resistance
@anchor{#spell-resistance-1}
Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. Some spells also grant spell resistance.

To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the creature's spell resistance. The defender's spell resistance is like an @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against magical attacks. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't affect the creature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell resistance to operate.

Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell Resistance Applies, below.

A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature's next turn. At the beginning of the creature's next turn, the creature's spell resistance automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).

A creature's spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.

A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another.

Spell resistance does not stack, but rather overlaps.

@node When Spell Resistance Applies
@section When Spell Resistance Applies
@anchor{#when-spell-resistance-applies}
Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell. In general, whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does.

@strong{Targeted Spells}: Spell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature's spell resistance applies only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.

@strong{Area Spells}: Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell's area. It protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.

@strong{Effect Spells}: Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as @emph{web.}

Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that's already been cast. Check spell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell.

Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance is back up.

Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant creature's mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is required. Spell-resistant creatures can be harmed by a spell when they are not being directly affected.

Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature's senses or reveals something about the creature.

Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations but lasting results aren't subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast.

@node Successful Spell Resistance
@section Successful Spell Resistance
@anchor{#successful-spell-resistance}
Spell resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from affecting or harming the resistant creature, but it never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell's effect on another creature. Spell resistance prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.

Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against spell resistance allows the resistant creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others normally.

@node Conditions
@chapter Conditions
@anchor{#conditions}
If more than one condition affects a character, apply them all. If effects can't combine, apply the most severe effect.

@strong{Bleed}: A creature that is taking bleed damage takes the listed amount of damage at the beginning of its turn. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Some bleed effects cause ability damage or even ability drain. Bleed effects do not stack with each other unless they deal different kinds of damage. When two or more bleed effects deal the same kind of damage, take the worse effect. In this case, ability drain is worse than ability damage.

@strong{Blinded}: The creature cannot see. It takes a --2 penalty to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}, loses its [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any), and takes a --4 penalty on most [Strength]- and [Dexterity]-based skill checks and on opposed @ref{#perception,Perception} skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and @ref{#perception,Perception} checks based on sight) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

@strong{Broken}: Items that have taken damage in excess of half their total [hit points] gain the broken condition, meaning they are less effective at their designated task. The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.

@itemize
@item
If the item is a weapon, any attacks made with the item suffer a --2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Such weapons only score a critical hit on a natural 20 and only deal ×2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.
@item
If the item is a suit of armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to [AC] is halved, rounding down. Broken armor doubles its armor check penalty on skills.
@item
If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item takes a --2 penalty.
@item
If the item is a wand or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.
@item
If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 75% of their normal value. If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with a @emph{[mending]} or @emph{[make whole]}spell cast by a character with a caster level equal to or higher than the item's. Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original [hit points] or higher@emph{.}Non-magical items can be repaired in a similar fashion, or through the Craft skill used to create it. Generally speaking, this requires a DC 20 Craft check and 1 hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Most craftsmen charge one-tenth the item's total cost to repair such damage (more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).
@end itemize

@strong{Confused}: A confused creature is mentally befuddled and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot tell the difference between ally and foe, treating all creatures as enemies. Allies wishing to cast a beneficial spell that requires a touch on a confused creature must succeed on a melee touch attack. If a confused creature is attacked, it attacks the creature that last attacked it until that creature is dead or out of sight.

Roll on the following table at the beginning of each confused subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.

@multitable {76--100} {Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self).} 
@headitem

@item 
76--100
 @tab Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self).
@end multitable

A confused creature who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against anything that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

@strong{Cowering}: The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a --2 penalty to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} and loses his [Dexterity] bonus (if any).

@strong{Dazed}: The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to [AC].

A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.

@strong{Dazzled}: The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a --1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based @ref{#perception,Perception} checks.

@strong{Dead}: The character's [hit points] are reduced to a negative amount equal to his [Constitution] score, his [Constitution] drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character's soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.

@strong{Deafened}: A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a --4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails @ref{#perception,Perception} checks based on sound, takes a --4 penalty on opposed @ref{#perception,Perception} checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

@strong{Disabled}: A character with 0 [hit points], or one who has negative [hit points] but has become stable and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single [move action] or [standard action] each round (but not both, nor can he take [full-round actions], but he can still take [swift], [immediate], and [free actions]). He moves at half speed. Taking [move action]s doesn't risk further injury, but performing any [standard action] (or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character's [hit points], he is now in negative [hit points] and dying.

A disabled character with negative [hit points] recovers [hit points] naturally if he is being helped. Otherwise, each day he can attempt a DC 10 [Constitution] check after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering [hit points] naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing [hit points] naturally.

@strong{Dying}: A dying creature is unconscious and near death. Creatures that have negative [hit points] and have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions. On the character's next turn, after being reduced to negative [hit points] (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution] check to become stable. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is stable does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature has an amount of negative [hit points] equal to its [Constitution] score, it dies.

@strong{Energy Drained}: The character gains one or more negative levels, which might become permanent. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as [Hit Dice], he dies. See [Energy Drain and Negative levels] for more information.

@strong{Entangled}: The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a --2 penalty on all attack rolls and a --4 penalty to [Dexterity]. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a [concentration check] (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.

@strong{Exhausted}: An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a --6 penalty to [Strength] and [Dexterity]. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.

@strong{Fascinated}: A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a --4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as @ref{#perception,Perception} checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.

@strong{Fatigued}: A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a --2 penalty to [Strength] and [Dexterity]. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.

@strong{Flat-Footed}: A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, unable to react normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.

@strong{Frightened}: A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a --2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.

@strong{Grappled}: A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a --4 penalty to [Dexterity]. A grappled creature takes a --2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a [concentration check] (DC 10 + grappler's [CMB] + spell level), or lose the spell. Grappled creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity.

A grappled creature cannot use @ref{#stealth,Stealth} to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so. If a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its [CMD] to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.

@strong{Helpless}: A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent's mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a [Dexterity] of 0 (--5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.

As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A rogue also gets his sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a [Fortitude] save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.

Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make [Fortitude] saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.

@strong{Incorporeal}: Creatures with the incorporeal condition do not have a physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Incorporeal creatures take half damage (50%) from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Incorporeal creatures take full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as all force effects.

@strong{Invisible}: Invisible creatures are visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents' [Dexterity] bonuses to [AC] (if any). See Invisibility, under Special Abilities.

@strong{Nauseated}: Creatures with the nauseated condition experience stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single [move action]s per turn.

@strong{Panicked}: A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can't take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a --2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.

@strong{Paralyzed}: A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective [Dexterity] and [Strength] scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can't swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature---ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares to move through.

@strong{Petrified}: A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character's petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.

@strong{Pinned}: A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus.. A pinned character also takes an additional --4 penalty to his @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a [concentration check] (DC 10 + grappler's [CMB] + spell level) or lose the spell. Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.

@strong{Prone}: The character is lying on the ground. A prone attacker has a --4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} against ranged attacks, but takes a --4 penalty to [AC] against melee attacks.

Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.

@strong{Shaken}: A shaken character takes a --2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.

@strong{Sickened}: The character takes a --2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

@strong{Stable}: A character who was dying but who has stopped losing [hit points] each round and still has negative [hit points] is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses [hit points]. The character can make a DC 10 [Constitution] check each hour to become conscious and disabled (even though his [hit points] are still negative). The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total.

If a character has become stable on his own and hasn't had help, he is still at risk of losing [hit points]. Each hour he can make a [Constitution] check to become stable (as a character that has received aid), but each failed check causes him to lose 1 hit point.

@strong{Staggered}: A staggered creature may take a single [move action] or [standard action] each round (but not both, nor can he take [full-round actions]). A staggered creature can still take free, swift and immediate actions. A creature with nonlethal damage exactly equal to its current [hit points] gains the staggered condition.

@strong{Stunned}: A stunned creature drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a --2 penalty to [AC], and loses its [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (if any).

@strong{Unconscious}: Unconscious creatures are knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having negative [hit points] (but not more than the creature's [Constitution] score), or from nonlethal damage in excess of current [hit points].

Prestige classes allow characters to become truly exceptional, gaining powers beyond the ken of their peers. Unlike the core classes@emph{,}characters must meet specific requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. If a character does not meet the requirements for a prestige class before gaining any benefits of that level, that character cannot take that prestige class. Characters that take levels in prestige classes do not gain any favored class bonuses for those levels.

@strong{@ref{#arcane-archer,Arcane Archer}}: An arcane spellcaster who draws upon ancient elven traditions to infuse his arrows with potent magical power.

@strong{@ref{#arcane-trickster,Arcane Trickster}}: A troublemaker and a scoundrel who uses arcane magic to enhance her thievery and trickery.

@strong{@ref{#assassin,Assassin}}: A remorseless murderer who kills for money and the sheer thrill of death-dealing.

@strong{@ref{#dragon-disciple,Dragon Disciple}}: An arcane spellcaster who has embraced his latent draconic heritage and, over the course of training and devotion, undergoes a partial transformation into a dragon.

@strong{@ref{#duelist,Duelist}}: A swashbuckling swordfighter who relies upon grace, poise, and acrobatics to win the day.

@strong{@ref{#eldritch-knight,Eldritch Knight}}: An arcane spellcaster who augments his magical skills with combat to create a deadly combination of weapons and magic.

@strong{@ref{#loremaster,Loremaster}}: A spellcaster who devotes his life to research and rumination upon the mysteries of the world.

@chapter Creating NPCs
@anchor{#creating-npcs}
The world that the player characters inhabit should be full of rich and vibrant characters with whom they can interact. While most need little more than names and general descriptions, some require complete statistics, such as town guards, local clerics, and wizened sages. The PCs might find themselves in combat with these characters, either against them or as allies. Alternatively the PCs might find themselves relying on the skills and abilities of the NPCs. In either case, the process for creating these NPCs can be performed in seven simple steps.

@node Step 1 The Basics
@section Step 1: The Basics
@anchor{#step-1-the-basics}
The first step in making an NPC is to determine its basic role in your campaign. This includes its race, class, and basic concept.

@node Step 2 Determine Ability Scores
@section Step 2: Determine Ability Scores
@anchor{#step-2-determine-ability-scores}
Once the character's basic concept has been determined, its ability scores must be assigned. Apply the NPC's racial modifiers after the scores have been assigned. For every four levels the NPC has attained, increase one of its scores by 1. If the NPC possesses levels in a PC class, it is considered a heroic NPC and receives better ability scores. These scores can be assigned in any order.

@strong{Basic NPCs}: The ability scores for a basic NPC are: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 8.

@strong{Heroic NPCs}: The ability scores for a heroic NPC are: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.

@strong{Preset Ability Scores}: Instead of assigning the scores, you can use Table: NPC Ability Scores to determine the NPC's ability scores, adjusting them as necessary to fit. Use the Melee NPC ability scores for characters whose primary role involves melee combat, such as barbarians, fighters, monks, paladins, rangers, and warriors. The Ranged NPC ability scores are for characters that fight with ranged weapons or use their [Dexterity] to hit, such as fighters, rangers, and rogues. Use the Divine NPC ability scores for characters with divine spellcasting capabilities, such as adepts, clerics, and druids. The Arcane NPC ability scores should be used by characters with arcane spellcasting capabilities, such as bards, sorcerers, and wizards. Finally, the Skill NPC ability scores should be used for characters that focus on skill use, such as aristocrats, bards, commoners, experts, and rogues. Some NPCs might not fit into one of these categories and should have custom ability scores.

@node Step 3 Skills
@section Step 3: Skills
@anchor{#step-3-skills}
To assign skills precisely, total up the number of skill ranks possessed by the character and assign them normally. Remember that the number of ranks in an individual skill that a character can possess is limited by his total HD.

For simpler skill generation, refer to Table: NPC Skill Selections to determine the total number of skill selections the NPC possesses. After selecting that number of skills, mostly from the class skills lists of the NPC's class, the NPC receives a number of ranks in each skill equal to his level.

If the NPC has two classes, start by selecting skills for the class with the fewest number of skill selections. The NPC receives a number of ranks in those skills equal to his total character level. Next, find the difference in the number of selections between the first class and the other class possessed by the NPC. Select that number of new skills and give the NPC a number of ranks in those skills equal to his level in the second class. For example, a human fighter 3/monk 4 with a +1 [Intelligence] modifier can select four skills for his fighter class (since it receives fewer selections). These four skills each have seven ranks (equal to his total level). Next, he selects a number of skills equal to the difference between the fighter and the monk classes, in this case two skills. These two skills each have four ranks (his monk level).

If the NPC has three or more classes, you must use the precise method for determining his skills.

Once all of the NPC's ranks have been determined, assign class skill bonuses and apply the bonus or penalty from the NPC's relevant ability score.

@node Step 4 Feats
@section Step 4: Feats
@anchor{#step-4-feats}
After skills have been determined, the next step is to assign the NPC's feats. Start by assigning all of the feats granted through class abilities. Next, assign the feats garnered from the NPC's total character level (one feat for every two levels beyond 1st). Remember that humans receive an additional feat at 1st level.

@node Step 5 Class Features
@section Step 5: Class Features
@anchor{#step-5-class-features}
After determining feats, the next step is to fill in all the class features possessed by the NPC. This is the time to make decisions about the NPC's spell selection, rage powers, rogue talents, and other class-based abilities.

When it comes to spells, determine how many spell selections you need to make for each level. Choose a variety of spells for the highest two levels of spells possessed by the NPC. For all other levels, stick to a few basic spells, prepared multiple times (if possible). If this NPC is slated to appear in only one encounter (such as a combat), leaving off lower-level spells entirely is an acceptable way to speed up generation, especially if the NPC is unlikely to cast those spells. You can always choose a few during play if they are needed.

@node Step 6 Gear
@section Step 6: Gear
@anchor{#step-6-gear}
After recording all of the NPC's class features, the next step is to outfit the character with gear appropriate to his level. Note that NPCs receive less gear than PCs of an equal level. If an NPC is a recurring character, his gear should be selected carefully. Use the total gp value found on Table: NPC Gear to determine how much gear he should carry. NPCs that are only scheduled to appear once can have a simpler gear selection. Table: NPC Gear includes a number of categories to make it easier to select an NPC's gear. When outfitting the character, spend the listed amount on each category by purchasing as few items as possible. Leftover gold from any category can be spent on any other category. Funds left over at the end represent coins and jewelry carried by the character.

Note that these values are approximate and based on the values for a campaign using the medium experience progression and a normal treasure allotment. If your campaign is using the fast experience progression, treat your NPCs as one level higher when determining their gear. If your campaign is using the slow experience progression, treat the NPCs as one level lower when determining their gear. If your campaign is high fantasy, double these values. Reduce them by half if your campaign is low fantasy. If the final value of an NPC's gear is a little over or under these amounts, that's okay.

@strong{Weapons}: This includes normal, masterwork, and magic weapons, as well as magic staves and wands used by spellcasters to harm their enemies. For example, a @emph{wand of scorching ray} would count as a weapon, but a @emph{staff of life} would count as a piece of magic gear.

@strong{Protection}: This category includes armor and shields, as well as any magic item that augments a character's @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} or saving throws.

@strong{Magic}: This category includes all other permanent magic items. Most rings, rods, and wondrous items fit into this category.

@strong{Limited Use}: Items that fall into this category include alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands with few charges. Charged wondrous items fall into this grouping as well.

@strong{Gear}: Use the amount in this category to purchase standard nonmagical gear for the character. In most cases, this equipment can be omitted during creation and filled in as needed during play. You can assume that the character has whatever gear is needed for him to properly use his skills and class abilities. This category can also include jewelry, gems, or loose coins that the NPC might have on his person.

@node Step 7 Details
@section Step 7: Details
@anchor{#step-7-details}
Once you have assigned all of the NPC's gear, all that remains is to fill out the details. Determine the character's attack and damage bonuses, CMB, CMD, initiative modifier, and @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class}. If the character's magic items affect his skills or ability scores, make sure to take those changes into account. Determine the character's total hit points by assuming the average result. Finally, fill out any other important details, such as name, alignment, religion, and a few personality traits to round him out.

C = Class Skill; * Armor check penalty applies

Skill descriptions adhere to the following guidelines.

@strong{Skill Name}: The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.

@emph{Key Ability}: The abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check.

@emph{Trained Only}: If this notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1 rank in the skill to use it. If this notation is omitted, the skill can be used untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).

@emph{Armor Check Penalty}: If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check penalty applies (see [Equipment]) to checks using this skill. If this entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.

@strong{Description}: The skill name line is followed by a general description of what using the skill represents.

@strong{Check}: What a character (“you” in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check's Difficulty Class (DC).

@strong{Action}: The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.

@strong{Try Again}: Any conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill successfully. If the skill doesn't allow you to attempt the same task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as with the Climb skill), you can't take 20. If this paragraph is omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty other than the additional time required.

@strong{Special}: Any extra facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class, feat choices, or race.

@strong{Restriction}: The full utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain classes. This entry indicates whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.

@strong{Untrained}: This entry indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do with it. If this entry doesn't appear, it means that the skill functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used untrained) or that an untrained character can't attempt checks with this skill (for skills that are designated “Trained Only”).

@strong{Eagle's Splendor}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2, paladin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an eagle)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Charisma], adding the usual benefits to [Charisma]-based skill checks and other uses of the [Charisma] modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on [Charisma]) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Charisma], but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase.

@strong{Eagle's Splendor, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[eagle's splendor]}, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Earthquake

@strong{Earthquake}

@strong{School} evocation [earth]; @strong{Level} cleric 8, druid 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Area} 80-ft.-radius spread (S)

@strong{Duration} 1 round

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

When you cast @emph{earthquake,}an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an @emph{earthquake}spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.

@emph{Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel}: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in ([Reflex] DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An @emph{earthquake}cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.

@emph{Cliffs}:@emph{Earthquake}causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage ([Reflex] DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).

@emph{Open Ground}: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 [Reflex] save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one ([Reflex] DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see [Environment] for more details).

@emph{Structure}: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage ([Reflex] DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).

@emph{River, Lake, or Marsh}: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 [Reflex] save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.

@emph{Pinned Beneath Rubble}: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls [unconscious], he or she must make a DC 15 [Constitution] check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

Elemental Body

@strong{Elemental Body I}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Casting Time}1 standard action

@strong{Components}V, S, M (the element you plan to assume)

@strong{Range}personal

@strong{Target}you

@strong{Duration}1 min/level (D)

When you cast this spell, you can assume the form of a Small air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the type of elemental into which you change. Elemental abilities based on size, such as burn, vortex, and whirlwind, use the size of the elemental you transform into to determine their effect.

@emph{Air elemental}: If the form you take is that of a Small air elemental, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Dexterity] and a +2 natural armor bonus. You also gain fly 60 feet (perfect), [darkvision] 60 feet, and the ability to create a whirlwind.

@emph{Earth elemental}: If the form you take is that of a Small earth elemental, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Strength] and a +4 natural armor bonus. You also gain [darkvision] 60 feet, and the ability to earth glide.

@emph{Fire elemental}: If the form you take is that of a Small fire elemental, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Dexterity] and a +2 natural armor bonus. You gain [darkvision] 60 feet, resist fire 20, vulnerability to cold, and the burn ability.

@emph{Water elemental}: If the form you take is that of a Small water elemental, you gain a +2 size bonus to your [Constitution] and a +4 natural armor bonus. You also gain swim 60 feet, [darkvision] 60 feet, the ability to create a vortex, and the ability to breathe water.

@strong{Elemental Body II}

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 5

This spell functions as @emph{[elemental body I],}except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Medium air, earth, fire, or water elemental. The abilities you gain depend upon the elemental.

@emph{Air elemental}: As @emph{[elemental body I]} except that you gain a +4 size bonus to your [Dexterity] and a +3 natural armor bonus.

@strong{School}transmutation (polymorph); @strong{Level}sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as @emph{[elemental body II],}except that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large air, earth, fire, or water elemental.

Elemental Swarm

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} two or more summoned creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} 10 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. A druid can choose any plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water); a cleric opens a portal to the plane matching his domain.

When the spell is complete, 2d4 Large elementals appear. Ten minutes later, 1d4 Huge elementals appear. Ten minutes after that, one greater elemental appears. Each elemental has maximum hit points per HD. Once these creatures appear, they serve you for the duration of the spell.

The elementals obey you explicitly and never attack you, even if someone else manages to gain control over them. You do not need to concentrate to maintain control over the elementals. You can dismiss them singly or in groups at any time.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, earth, fire, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

Endure Elements

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} 24 hours

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

A creature protected by @emph{endure elements}suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between --50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make [Fortitude] saves. The creature's equipment is likewise protected.

@emph{Endure elements}doesn't provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.

Energy Drain

@strong{Energy Drain}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] partial; see text for @emph{[enervation]}

This spell functions like @emph{[enervation],}except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary [negative levels]. Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a [Fortitude] saving throw (DC = @emph{energy drain}spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that [negative level]is removed. If it fails, that [negative level]becomes permanent.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4 × 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

@strong{Effect} ray of negative energy

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You point your finger and fire a black ray of negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If you hit, the subject gains 1d4 temporary [negative levels] (see @ref{#special-abilities,Special Abilities}). [Negative levels] stack.

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, [negative levels] have a chance of becoming permanent, but the [negative levels] from @emph{enervation}don't last long enough to do so.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4 × 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

Enlarge Person

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, M (powdered iron)

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one humanoid creature

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature's size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to [Strength], a --2 size penalty to [Dexterity] (to a minimum of 1), and a --1 penalty on attack rolls and [AC] due to its increased size.

A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target's speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a [Strength] check (using its increased [Strength]) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it---the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see [Table: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage]). Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any @emph{enlarged}item that leaves an enlarged creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage. Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

@emph{Enlarge person}counters and dispels @emph{[reduce person]}.

@emph{Enlarge person}can be made permanent with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Enlarge Person, Mass}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Area}plants in a 40-ft.-radius spread

@strong{Duration}1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Reflex] partial; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: no

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their save gain the [entangled] condition. Creatures that make their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of your turn. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately. Those that fail must end their movement and gain the [entangled] condition. [Entangled] creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a [Strength] or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

If the plants in the area are covered in thorns, those in the area take 1 point of damage each time they fail a save against the @emph{entangle} or fail a check made to break free. Other effects, depending on the local plants, might be possible at GM discretion.

Enthrall

@strong{Enthrall}

@strong{School} enchantment (charm) [language dependent, mind-affecting, sonic]; @strong{Level} bard 2, cleric 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} any number of creatures

@strong{Duration} 1 hour or less

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them enthralled. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw.

A target with 4 or more HD or with a [Wisdom] score of 16 or higher remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent. It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes.

The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.

If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a [Charisma] check to try to end the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the [Charisma] bonus of the creature with the highest [Charisma] in the group; others may make [Charisma] checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this check result beats your [Charisma] check result. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.

If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously enthralled members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4 or more HD or with a [Wisdom] score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.

Erase

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one scroll or two pages

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Erase}removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove @emph{[explosive runes],}a @emph{[glyph of warding],}a @emph{[sepia snake sigil],}or an @emph{[arcane mark]}, but not @emph{[illusory script]}or a @emph{symbol}spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase @emph{[explosive runes]}, a @emph{[glyph of warding]}, or a @emph{[sepia snake sigil]}, you accidentally activate that writing instead.

Ethereal Jaunt

@strong{Ethereal Jaunt}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

You become ethereal, along with your equipment. For the duration of the spell, you are in the Ethereal Plane, which overlaps the Material Plane. When the spell expires, you return to material existence.

An ethereal creature is [invisible], insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. As an insubstantial creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane.

Treat other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.

If you end the spell and become material while inside a material object (such as a solid wall), you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet that you so travel.

Etherealness

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

@strong{Range} touch; see text

@strong{Targets} you and one other touched creature per three levels

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell functions like @emph{[ethereal jaunt],}except that you and other willing creatures joined by linked hands (along with their equipment) become ethereal. Besides yourself, you can bring one creature per three caster levels to the Ethereal Plane. Once ethereal, the subjects need not stay together.

When the spell expires, all affected creatures on the Ethereal Plane return to material existence.

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

Explosive Runes

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The @emph{explosive runes}detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the @emph{explosive runes}(close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the @emph{explosive runes}is entitled to a [Reflex] save for half damage. The object on which the @emph{explosive runes}were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the @emph{explosive runes.}Likewise, you can remove the @emph{explosive runes}whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}or @emph{erase}spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the @emph{explosive runes}and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

Magic traps such as @emph{explosive runes}are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart @emph{explosive runes}. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for @emph{explosive runes}.

@strong{Target}one living creature

@strong{Duration}1 round/level

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: yes

Each round, you can target a single living creature, striking it with waves of power. Depending on the target's HD, this attack has as many as three effects.

 @tab [Panicked], [sickened]
@item

 @tab Comatose, [panicked], [sickened]
@end multitable

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

@emph{Sickened}: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A creature affected by this spell remains [sickened] for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a @emph{[remove disease]}or @emph{[heal]}spell, but a @emph{[remove curse]}is effective.

@emph{Panicked}: The subject becomes [panicked] for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains [shaken] for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes [panicked] again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

@emph{Comatose}: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a @emph{[sleep]}effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.

@strong{Ice Storm}

@strong{Area} cylinder (20-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Great magical hailstones pound down upon casting this spell, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. This damage only occurs once, when the spell is cast. For the remaining duration of the spell, heavy snow and sleet rains down in the area. Creatures inside this area take a --4 penalty on Perception skill checks and the entire area is treated as difficult terrain. At the end of the duration, the snow and hail disappear, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

@strong{Area}cone-shaped emanation

@strong{Duration}3 rounds/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}: none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: no

This spell functions as @emph{[detect magic]}, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This spell does not allow you to identify artifacts.

Illusory Script

@strong{Illusory Script}

@strong{School} illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute per page

@strong{Components} V, S, M (lead-based ink worth 50 gp)

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.

@strong{Duration} one day/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The @emph{illusory script}appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character@emph{.}

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a @emph{[suggestion]} implanted in the script by you at the time the @emph{illusory script} spell was cast. The @emph{[suggestion]} lasts only 30 minutes. Typical @emph{suggestions} include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of this note,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by @emph{[dispel magic],}the @emph{illusory script}and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the @emph{[true seeing]}spell with the @emph{[read magic]}or @emph{[comprehend languages]}spell.

@strong{Effect} image 1 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft.

@strong{Duration} permanent

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Although the caster can see through his @emph{illusory wall}, other creatures cannot, even if they succeed at their will save (but they do learn that it is not real).

Imbue with Spell Ability

@strong{Target} creature touched; see text

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless)

You transfer some of your currently prepared spells, and the ability to cast them, to another creature. Only a creature with an [Intelligence] score of at least 5 and a [Wisdom] score of at least 9 can receive this boon. Only cleric spells from the schools of abjuration, divination, and conjuration (healing) can be transferred. The number and level of spells that the subject can be granted depends on its Hit Dice; even multiple castings of @emph{imbue with spell ability}can't exceed this limit.

@multitable {HD of Recipient} {One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell} 
@headitem 
HD of Recipient
 @tab Spells Imbued

@item

 @tab One or two 1st-level spells
@item 
5 or higher
 @tab One or two 1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell
@end multitable

The transferred spell's variable characteristics (range, duration, area, and the like) function according to your level, not the level of the recipient.

Once you cast @emph{imbue with spell ability,}you cannot prepare a new 4th-level spell to replace it until the recipient uses the imbued spells or is slain, or until you dismiss the @emph{imbue with spell ability}spell. In the meantime, you remain responsible to your deity or your principles for the use to which the spell is put. If the number of 4th-level spells you can cast decreases, and that number drops below your current number of active @emph{imbue with spell ability}spells, the more recently cast imbued spells are dispelled.

To cast a spell with a verbal component, the subject must be able to speak. To cast a spell with a somatic component, it must be able to move freely. To cast a spell with a material component or focus, it must have the materials or focus.

Implosion

@strong{Target} one corporeal creature/round

@strong{Duration} concentration (up to 1 round per 2 levels)

@strong{Saving Throw} [Fortitude] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature's body. Each round you concentrate (including the first), you can cause one creature to collapse in on itself, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If you break concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions that have already happened remain in effect. You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on creatures in [gaseous form] or on [incorporeal] creatures.

Imprisonment

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

When you cast @emph{imprisonment}and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the @emph{[temporal stasis]}spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a @emph{freedom}spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a @emph{crystal ball,}a @emph{[locate object]}spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but @emph{[discern location]}does. A @emph{[wish]}or @emph{[miracle]}spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a --4 penalty on its save.

Incendiary Cloud

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Area}cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

@strong{Duration}1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}: [Reflex] half, see text; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}}: no

An @emph{incendiary cloud}spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a @emph{[fog cloud]}does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 6d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make [Reflex] saves each round to take half damage.

As with a @emph{[cloudkill]}spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter.

As with @emph{[fog cloud]}, wind disperses the smoke, and the spell can't be cast underwater.

This spell functions like @emph{[inflict light wounds]}, except that you deal 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

@strong{Inflict Critical Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 8

Inflict Light Wounds

@strong{Inflict Light Wounds}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 1

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} creature touched

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

When laying your hand upon a creature, you channel negative energy that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell cures such a creature of a like amount of damage, rather than harming it.

@strong{Inflict Light Wounds, Mass}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

@strong{Target} one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] half; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

Negative energy spreads out in all directions from the point of origin, dealing 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25) to nearby living enemies.

Like other @emph{inflict}spells, @emph{mass [inflict light wounds]}cures undead in its area rather than damaging them. A cleric capable of spontaneously casting @emph{inflict}spells can also spontaneously cast @emph{mass inflict}spells.

Inflict Moderate Wounds

@strong{Inflict Moderate Wounds}

@strong{School} necromancy; @strong{Level} cleric 2

Insanity

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Target} one living creature

@strong{Duration} instantaneous

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The affected creature suffers from a continuous @emph{confusion}effect, as the spell.

@emph{[Remove curse]} does not remove@emph{insanity. Greater restoration, [heal], [limited wish], [miracle],} or @emph{[wish]} can restore the creature.

Insect Plague

@strong{Insect Plague}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} cleric 5, druid 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 round

@strong{Components} V, S, DF

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} one swarm of wasps per three levels, each of which must be adjacent to at least one other swarm

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You summon a number of swarms of wasps (one per three levels, to a maximum of six swarms at 18th level). The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). You may summon the wasp swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area. The swarms are stationary after being summoned, and won't pursue creatures that flee.

Instant Summons

@strong{Instant Summons}

@strong{School} conjuration (summoning); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M (sapphire worth 1,000 gp)

@strong{Range} see text

@strong{Target} one object weighing 10 lbs. or less whose longest dimension is 6 ft. or less

@strong{Duration} permanent until discharged

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

You call some nonliving item directly to your hand from virtually any location.

First, you must place your @emph{[arcane mark]} on the item. Then you cast this spell, which magically and invisibly inscribes the name of the item on a sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp. Thereafter, you can summon the item by speaking a special word (set by you when the spell is cast) and crushing the gem. The item appears instantly in your hand. Only you can use the gem in this way.

If the item is in the possession of another creature, the spell does not work, but you know who the possessor is and roughly where that creature is located when the summons occurs.

The inscription on the gem is [invisible]. It is also unreadable, except by means of a @emph{[read magic]}spell, to anyone but you.

The item can be summoned from another plane, but only if no other creature has claimed ownership of it.

Interposing Hand

@strong{Interposing Hand}

@strong{School} evocation [force]; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 5

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, F (a soft glove)

@strong{Range}medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

@strong{Effect} 10-ft. hand

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

@emph{Interposing hand}creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 [AC]) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand---it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of @emph{[darkness],}[invisibility]@emph{,} polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.

An @emph{interposing hand}is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you're undamaged, and is [AC] 20 (--1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it.

The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a @emph{[wall of force]}or enter an @emph{[antimagic field]}, but it suffers the full effect of a @emph{[prismatic wall]}or @emph{[prismatic sphere].}The hand makes saving throws as its caster.

@emph{[Disintegrate]}or a successful @emph{[dispel magic]}destroys it.

Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature's attacks.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

Invisibility

@strong{Invisibility}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)

@strong{Range} personal or touch

@strong{Target} you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs./level

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless) or [Will] negates (harmless, object); @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes (harmless) or yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched becomes [invisible]. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see [invisible] things or you employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an [invisible] creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes [invisible], although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically silenced@emph{,}and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary [invisible] creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the [invisible] character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an [invisible] being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as @emph{[bless]}that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

@emph{Invisibility}can be made permanent (on objects only) with a @emph{[permanency]}spell.

@strong{Invisibility, Greater}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

@strong{Components}: V, S

@strong{Target} you or creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1 round/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw}[Will] negates (harmless)

This spell functions like @emph{[invisibility]}, except that it doesn't end if the subject attacks.

@strong{Invisibility, Mass}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 7

@strong{Range} long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

@strong{Targets} any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 180 ft. apart

This spell functions like @emph{[invisibility],}except that the effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.

Invisibility Purge

@strong{Invisibility Purge}

@strong{School} evocation; @strong{Level} cleric 3

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

You surround yourself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per caster level that negates all forms of [invisibility].

Anything [invisible] becomes visible while in the area.

Invisibility Sphere

@strong{Invisibility Sphere}

@strong{School} illusion (glamer); @strong{Level} bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

@strong{Components}: V, S, M

@strong{Area} 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature

This spell functions like @emph{[invisibility],}except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient at the time the spell is cast. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become [invisible]. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the @emph{invisibility sphere}ends.

Iron Body

@strong{Iron Body}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V, S, M/DF (a piece of iron from an iron golem, a hero's armor, or a war machine)

@strong{Range} personal

@strong{Target} you

@strong{Duration} 1 min./level (D)

This spell transforms your body into living iron, which grants you several powerful resistances and abilities. You gain [damage reduction] 15/adamantine. You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, drowning, electricity, poison, stunning, and all spells or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration, because you have no physiology or respiration while this spell is in effect. You take only half damage from acid and fire. However, you also become vulnerable to all special attacks that affect iron golems.

You gain a +6 enhancement bonus to your [Strength] score, but you take a --6 penalty to [Dexterity] as well score of 1), and your speed is reduced to half normal. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 35% and a --6 armor check penalty, just as if you were clad in full plate armor. You cannot drink (and thus can't use potions) or play wind instruments.

Your unarmed attack deals damage equal to a club sized for you (1d4 for Small characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are considered armed when making unarmed attacks.

Your weight increases by a factor of 10, causing you to sink in water like a stone. However, you could survive the lack of air at the bottom of the ocean---at least until the spell duration expires.

Ironwood

@strong{Ironwood}

@strong{School} transmutation; @strong{Level} druid 6

@strong{Casting Time} 1 minute/lb. created

@strong{Components} V, S, F (wood to be transformed)

@strong{Range} 0 ft.

@strong{Effect} an @emph{ironwood}object weighing up to 5 lbs./level

@strong{Duration} 1 day/level (D)

@strong{Saving Throw} none; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} no

@emph{Ironwood}is a magical substance created by druids from normal wood. While remaining natural wood in almost every way, @emph{ironwood}is as strong, heavy, and resistant to fire as steel. Spells that affect metal or iron do not function on @emph{ironwood}. Spells that affect wood do affect @emph{ironwood}, although @emph{ironwood}does not burn. Using this spell with @emph{[wood shape]}or a wood-related Craft check, you can fashion wooden items that function as steel items. Thus, wooden plate armor and wooden swords can be created that are as durable as their normal steel counterparts. These items are freely usable by druids.

Further, if you make only half as much @emph{ironwood}as the spell would normally allow, any weapon, shield, or suit of armor so created is treated as a magic item with a +1 enhancement bonus.

Irresistible Dance

@strong{Irresistible Dance}

@strong{School} enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; @strong{Level} bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

@strong{Casting Time} 1 standard action

@strong{Components} V

@strong{Range} touch

@strong{Target} living creature touched

@strong{Duration} 1d4+1 rounds

@strong{Saving Throw} [Will] partial; @strong{@ref{#spell-resistance,Spell Resistance}} yes

The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a --4 penalty to @ref{#armor-class,Armor Class} and a --10 penalty on [Reflex] saves, and it negates any [AC] bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful [Will] save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.
