*Baleful Polymorph*

   *School* transmutation (polymorph); *Level* druid 5, sorcerer/wizard
5

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target*one creature

   *Duration*permanent

   *Saving Throw*: [Fortitude] negates, [Will] partial, see text;
**note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*: yes

   As _[beast shape III],_except that you change the subject into a
Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would
prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water,
the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.

   If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a [Will] save. If
this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary,
supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast
spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special
abilities, and [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma] scores of its
new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or
HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base attack
bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class
features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary,
supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

   Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled when
a target fails to resist the effects of _baleful polymorph_, and as
long as _baleful polymorph_ remains in effect, the target cannot use
other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. [Incorporeal]
or gaseous creatures are immune to _baleful polymorph_, and a creature
with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a
standard action.

   Bane

   *Bane*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [fear, mind-affecting]; *Level*
cleric 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 50 ft.

   *Area* 50-ft.-radius burst, centered on you

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Bane_fills your enemies with fear and doubt. Each affected creature
takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -1 penalty on saving throws
against fear effects. _Bane_counters and dispels _[bless]_.

   Banishment

   *Banishment*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (see text)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _banishment_spell is a more powerful version of the
_[dismissal]_spell. It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out
of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level
can be banished.

   You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least
one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise
opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your
caster level check to overcome the target's [spell resistance] (if
any), and the saving throw DC increases by 2.

   Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the
purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level
check against [spell resistance] and increasing the save DC by 4).

   Barkskin

   *Barkskin*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 2, ranger 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*
yes (harmless)

   _Barkskin_toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2
enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This
enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above
3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.

   The enhancement bonus provided by _barkskin_stacks with the target's
natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural
armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor
bonus of +0.

   Bear's Endurance

   *Bear's Endurance*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a
bear)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell
grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to [Constitution], which adds
the usual benefits to hit points, [Fortitude] saves, [Constitution]
checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in
[Constitution] score are not temporary hit points. They go away when
the subject's [Constitution] drops back to normal. They are not lost
first as temporary hit points are.

   *Bear's Endurance, Mass*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   _Mass [bear's endurance]_works like _[bear's endurance]_, except
that it affects multiple creatures.

   Beast Shape

   *Beast Shape I*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to
assume)

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 5

   This spell functions as _[beast shape II],_except that it also
allows you to assume the form of a Diminutive or Huge creature of the

   Bestow Curse

   *Bestow Curse*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following.

   * -6 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).

   * -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill
     checks.

   * Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise,
     it takes no action.

   You may also invent your own curse, but it should be no more
powerful than those described above.

   The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be
removed with a _[break enchantment]_, _[limited wish]_, _[miracle]_,
_[remove curse]_, or _[wish]_spell.

   _Bestow curse_counters _[remove curse]_.

   Binding

   *Binding*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 minute

   *Components* V, S, M (opals worth 500 gp per HD of the target
creature, plus other components as specified below)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration* see text (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _binding_spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The
target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least
half your caster level.

   You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For
each assistant who casts _[suggestion]_, your caster level for this
casting of _binding_increases by 1. For each assistant who casts
_[dominate animal], [dominate person],_or _[dominate monster],_your
caster level for this casting of _binding_increases by a number equal
to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target
is appropriate for a _binding_spell. Since the assistants' spells are
cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the
_binding_spell, saving throws and [spell resistance] against the
assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether
the target gets an initial [Will] saving throw and how long the
_binding_lasts. All _binding_spells are dismissible.

   Regardless of the version of _binding_you cast, you can specify
triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature
whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as
you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood
of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name,
identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable
actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or
hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering
conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the
save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.

   If you cast any of the first three versions of _binding_(those with
limited durations), you may cast additional _binding_spells to prolong
the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a
saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your
caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If
the creature's save succeeds, all _binding_spells it has received are
broken.

   The _binding_spell has six versions. Choose one of the following
versions when you cast the spell.

   _Chaining_: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an
_[antipathy]_spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject,
except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of
this form of _binding_is confined to the spot it occupied when it
received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long
enough to wrap around the creature three times.

   _Slumber_: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as
long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or
drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of _binding_is
slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting
this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a [sleep]
effect.

   _Bound Slumber_: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for
as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting
this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose
petals. This is a [sleep] effect.

   _Hedged Prison_: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought
within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This
effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version
requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the
spell is cast.

   _Metamorphosis_: The subject assumes [gaseous form], except for its
head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which
may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its
surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack,
or use any of its powers or abilities. The _binding_is permanent. The
subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed,
nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.

   _Minimus Containment_: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch
or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The
_binding_is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or
drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.

   You can't dispel a _binding_spell with _[dispel magic]_or a similar
effect, though an _[antimagic field]_or _[mage's disjunction]_affects
it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its
home plane by _[dismissal], banishment,_or a similar effect.

   Black Tentacles

   *Black Tentacles*

   *School*conjuration (creation); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (octopus or squid tentacle)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area*20-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration*1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*: none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*:
no

   This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear,
burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the area.

   Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a
combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of
your turn, including the round that _black tentacles_ is cast.
Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically
attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When
determining the tentacles' [CMB], the tentacles use your caster level
as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their
[Strength] and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell
effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of
effect.

   If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4
points of damage and gains the [grappled] condition. Grappled opponents
cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is
prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The _black
tentacles_ spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against
opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes.
Each round that _black tentacles_ succeeds on a grapple check, it deals
an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The [CMD] of _black tentacles_,
for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its [CMB].

   The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can
be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered
difficult terrain while the tentacles last.

   Blade Barrier

   *Blade Barrier*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* cleric 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect*wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a ringed
wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels;
either form is 20 ft. high

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half or [Reflex] negates; see text; **note
Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure
force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall
takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a
[Reflex] save for half damage.

   If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are,
each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such
creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and
thus take no damage by making a successful [Reflex] save.

   A _blade barrier_provides cover (+4 bonus to [AC], +2 bonus on
[Reflex] saves) against attacks made through it.

   Blasphemy

   *Blasphemy*

   *School*evocation [evil, sonic]; *Level*cleric 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range*40 ft.

   *Area*nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Will] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Any nonevil creature within the area of a _blasphemy_spell suffers
the following ill effects.

HD                       Effect
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Equal to caster level    [Dazed]
Up to caster level -1    Weakened, [dazed]
Up to caster level -5    [Paralyzed], weakened, [dazed]
Up to caster level -10   Killed, paralyzed, weakened, [dazed]

   The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save
reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple
effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

   _Dazed_: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it
defends itself normally. Save negates.

   _Weakened_: The creature's [Strength] score decreases by 2d6 points
for 2d4 rounds. Save for half.

   _[Paralyzed]_: The creature is paralyzed and [helpless] for 1d10
minutes. Save reduces the [paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

   _Killed_: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save
negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6
points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

   Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell,
nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished
back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at
least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the
creatures hear the _blasphemy_ or not_._The banishment effect allows a
[Will] save (at a -4 penalty) to negate.

   Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by
_blasphemy._

   Bleed

   *Bleed*

   *School*necromancy; *Level*cleric 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*: [Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*: yes

   You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but
stabilized to resume [dying]. Upon casting this spell, you target a
living creature that has -1 or fewer hit points. That creature begins
dying, taking 1 point of damage per round. The creature can be
stabilized later normally. This spell causes a creature that is dying
to take 1 point of damage.

   Bless

   *Bless*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric
1, paladin 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 50 ft.

   *Area* The caster and all allies within a 50-ft. burst, centered on
the caster

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*
yes (harmless)

   _Bless_fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1 morale
bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects.

   _Bless_counters and dispels _[bane]_.

   Bless Water

   *Bless Water*

   *School* transmutation [good]; *Level* cleric 1, paladin 1

   *Casting Time* 1 minute

   *Components* V, S, M (5 pounds of powdered silver worth 25 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* flask of water touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with positive
energy, turning it into [holy water].

   Bless Weapon

   *Bless Weapon*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* paladin 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target*weapon touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes. The
weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of
bypassing the [DR] of evil creatures or striking evil [incorporeal]
creatures (though the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus).
The weapon also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the
[DR] of certain creatures. (This effect overrides and suppresses any
other alignment the weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can
be transmuted, but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't
confer the benefit to the projectiles they shoot.

   In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are
automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This last
effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a magical effect
related to critical hits, such as a _keen_ weapon or a _vorpal sword_.

   Blight

   *Blight*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* plant touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] half; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant
creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and may
attempt a [Fortitude] saving throw for half damage. A plant that isn't
a creature doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies.

   This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.

   Blindness/Deafness

   *Blindness/Deafness*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* bard 2, cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration* permanent (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You call upon the powers of unlife to render the subject [blinded]
or [deafened], as you choose.

   Blink

   *Blink*

   *School*transmutation; *Level*bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*personal

   *Target*you

   *Duration*1 round/level (D)

   You “blink” quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and
the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out of
reality at random. _Blink_has several effects, as follows.

   Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the
Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not
merely [invisible]. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal
creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).

   If the attacker can see [invisible] creatures, the miss chance is
also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal
creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a
20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about
to strike.

   Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you
while you're blinking unless your attacker can target [invisible],
ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just
as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the
Material Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).

   While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but
full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although
you are only partially visible, you are not considered [invisible] and
targets retain their [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] against your attacks.
You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that
cannot see [invisible] creatures.

   You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while
you are material.

   While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid
objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a
50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted
off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet
so traveled.

   Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can
see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal
creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.

   An ethereal creature is [invisible], [incorporeal], and capable of
moving in any direction, even up or down. As an [incorporeal] creature,
you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.

   An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but
everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the
Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

   Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects
extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice
versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells
you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain
material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the
Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

   Blur

   *Blur*

   *School* illusion (glamer); *Level* bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This
distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

   A _[see invisibility]_spell does not counteract the _blur_effect,
but a _[true seeing]_spell does.

   Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect
(though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

   Break Enchantment

   *Break Enchantment*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* bard 4, cleric 5, paladin 4,
sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 minute

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of each
other

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and
curses. _Break enchantment_can reverse even an instantaneous effect.
For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster
level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect.
Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect.
For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the DC of the curse.

   If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by _[dispel magic]_ or
_stone to flesh_, _break enchantment_works only if that spell is 5th
level or lower.

   If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, _break
enchantment_does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free
the victim from the item's effects.

   Breath of Life

   *Breath of Life*

   *School*conjuration (healing); *Level*cleric 5

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*touch

   *Target*creature touched

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates (harmless) or [Will] half, see text;
**note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless) or yes, see
text

   This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +25).

   Unlike other spells that heal damage, _breath of life_ can bring
recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature that has
died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell to the creature.
If the healed creature's hit point total is at a negative amount less
than its [Constitution] score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at
its new hit point total. If the creature's hit point total is at a
negative amount equal to or greater than its [Constitution] score, the
creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through _breath
of life_ gain a temporary [negative level]that lasts for 1 day.

   Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by _breath of life_.

   Like cure spells, _breath of life_ deals damage to undead creatures
rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to life.

   Bull's Strength

   *Bull's Strength*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a
bull)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement
bonus to [Strength], adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls,
melee damage rolls, and other uses of the [Strength] modifier.

   *Bull's Strength, Mass*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[bull's strength]_, except that it
affects multiple creatures.

   Burning Hands

   *Burning Hands*

   *School* evocation [fire]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 15 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A cone of searing flame shoots from your fingertips. Any creature in
the area of the flames takes 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level
(maximum 5d4). Flammable materials burn if the flames touch them. A
character can extinguish burning items as a full-round action.

   *Telekinesis*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Target or Targets* see text

   *Duration* concentration (up to 1 round/level) or instantaneous; see
text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object) or none; see text; **note
Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (object); see text

   You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on
the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force,
perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent
thrust.

   _Sustained Force_: A sustained force moves an object weighing no
more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level)
up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object
it possesses with a successful [Will] save or with [spell resistance].

   This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it
ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically,
horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond
your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If
you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.

   An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand.
For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an
object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight
limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though
delicate activities such as these require DC 15 [Intelligence] checks.

   _Combat Maneuver_: Alternatively, once per round, you can use
_[telekinesis]_to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin),
or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't
provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of
your [Combat Maneuver Bonus], and you add your [Intelligence] modifier
(if a wizard) or [Charisma] modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your
[Strength] or [Dexterity] modifier. No save is allowed against these
attempts, but [spell resistance] applies normally. This version of the
spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease
concentration.

   _Violent Thrust_: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a
single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level
(maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other
toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can
hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375
pounds at 15th level).

   You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown)
to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your
[Intelligence] modifier (if a wizard) or [Charisma] modifier (if a
sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no [Strength] bonus;
note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when
used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point
per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per
25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss
their target land in a square adjacent to the target.

   Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be
hurled, but they are allowed [Will] saves ) to negate the effect, as
are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.

   If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it
takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).

   Telekinetic Sphere

   *Telekinetic Sphere*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a crystal sphere and a pair of small magnets)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around creatures or
objects

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   This spell functions like _[resilient sphere],_but the creatures or
objects caught inside the globe created by the spell are made nearly
weightless. Anything contained within a _telekinetic sphere_weighs only
one-sixteenth of its normal weight. You can telekinetically lift
anything in the sphere that normally weighs 5,000 pounds or less. The
telekinetic control extends from you out to medium range (100 feet + 10
feet per caster level) after the sphere has succeeded in encapsulating
its contents.

   You can move the sphere, along with the objects and creatures it
contains that weigh a total of 5,000 pounds or less, by concentrating
on the sphere. You can begin moving a sphere in the round after casting
the spell. If you concentrate on doing so (a standard action), you can
move the sphere as much as 30 feet in a round. If you cease
concentrating, the sphere does not move in that round (if on a level
surface) or descends at its falling rate (if aloft) until it reaches a
level surface. You can resume concentrating on your next turn or any
later turn during the spell's duration.

   The sphere falls at a rate of only 60 feet per round, which is not
fast enough to cause damage to the contents of the sphere.

   You can move the sphere telekinetically even if you are in it.

   Telepathic Bond

   *Telepathic Bond*

   *School* divination; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (two eggshells from two different creatures)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* you plus one willing creature per three levels, no two of
which can be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing
creatures, each of which must have an [Intelligence] score of 3 or
higher. Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others.
The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond
regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as
a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any
distance (although not from one plane to another).

   If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond
forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.

   _Telepathic bond_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell,
though it only bonds two creatures per casting of _[permanency]_.

   Teleportation Circle

   *Teleportation Circle*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, M (amber dust to cover circle worth 1,000 gp)

   *Range* 0 ft.

   *Effect* 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that
teleports, as _[greater teleport],_any creature who stands on it to a
designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you
can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to
teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are
not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

   The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you
intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to
mark the circle in some way.

   _Teleportation circle_can be made permanent with a
_[permanency]_spell. A permanent _teleportation circle_that is disabled
becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.

   Magic traps such as _teleportation circle_are hard to detect and
disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature can use the
Disable Device to disarm magic traps. The DC in each case is 25 + spell
level, or 34 in the case of _teleportation circle_.

   Teleport

   *Teleport*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* personal and touch

   *Target* you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none and [Will] negates (object); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no and yes (object)

   This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination,
which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar
travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their
weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one
additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects
up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A
Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts
as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported
must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those
creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the
range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving
throw, nor is [spell resistance] applicable to you. Only objects held
or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and [spell
resistance].

   You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the
destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the
teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may
make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

   To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the
table at the end of this spell. Refer to the following information for
definitions of the terms on the table.

   _Familiarity_: “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very
often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you
know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you've
been there often. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more
than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a
place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as _[scrying]_.

   “False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you
are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists
as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar
to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain
results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real
destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

   _On Target_: You appear where you want to be.

   _Off Target_: You appear safely a random distance away from the
destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the
distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is
determined randomly.

   _Similar Area_: You wind up in an area that's visually or
thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the
closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.

   _Mishap_: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten
“scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the
chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each
time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

Familiarity         On Target   Off Target   Similar Area   Mishap
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Very familiar       01-97       98-99        100            --
Studied carefully   01-94       95-97        98-99          100
Seen casually       01-88       89-94        95-98          99-100
Viewed once         01-76       77-88        89-96          97-100
False destination   --          --           81-92          93-100

   *Teleport, Greater*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   This spell functions like _[teleport],_except that there is no range
limit and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you
need not have seen the destination, but in that case you must have at
least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting.
If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with
misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear in your
original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.

   Teleport Object

   *Teleport Object*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu.
ft./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   This spell functions like _[teleport],_except that it teleports an
object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

   If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on
the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was
teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A
successful targeted _[dispel magic]_spell cast on that point brings the
vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.

   Temporal Stasis

   *Temporal Stasis*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (powdered diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire
dust worth 5,000 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You must succeed on a melee touch attack. You place the subject into
a state of suspended animation. For the creature, time ceases to flow,
and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow older. Its
body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm it.
This state persists until the magic is removed (such as by a successful
_[dispel magic]_spell or a _[freedom]_spell).

   Time Stop

   *Time Stop*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1d4+1 rounds (apparent time); see text

   This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In
fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen,
though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are
free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire,
cold, gas, and the like can still harm you. While the _time stop_is in
effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells;
you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A spell that
affects an area and has a duration longer than the remaining duration
of the _time stop_ have their normal effects on other creatures once
the _time stop_ends. Most spellcasters use the additional time to
improve their defenses, summon allies, or flee from combat.

   You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a creature
stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that is not in
another creature's possession.

   You are undetectable while _time stop_lasts. You cannot enter an
area protected by an _[antimagic field]_while under the effect of _time
stop._

   Tiny Hut

   *Tiny Hut*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a small crystal bead)

   *Range* 20 ft.

   *Effect* 20-ft.-radius sphere centered on your location

   *Duration* 2 hours/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color you
desire around yourself. Half the sphere projects above the ground, and
the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. As many as nine other
Medium creatures can fit into the field with you; they can freely pass
into and out of the hut without harming it. However, if you remove
yourself from the hut, the spell ends.

   The temperature inside the hut is 70° F if the exterior temperature
is between 0° and 100° F. An exterior temperature below 0° or above
100° lowers or raises the interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1
basis. The hut also provides protection against the elements, such as
rain, dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than
hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater force
destroys it.

   The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it dimly
upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Although the force
field is opaque from the outside, it is transparent from within.
Missiles, weapons, and most spell effects can pass through the hut
without affecting it, although the occupants cannot be seen from
outside the hut (they have total concealment).

   Tongues

   *Tongues*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 2, cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, M/DF (a clay model of a ziggurat)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and
understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a
racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one
language at a time, although it may be able to understand several
languages. _Tongues_does not enable the subject to speak with creatures
who don't speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its
voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed
toward the subject in any way.

   _Tongues_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   Touch of Fatigue

   *Touch of Fatigue*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the
target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The
subject is immediately [fatigued] for the spell's duration.

   This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [fatigued].
Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's
duration expires.

   Touch of Idiocy

   *Touch of Idiocy*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* no; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   With a touch, you reduce the target's mental faculties. Your
successful melee touch attack applies a 1d6 penalty to the target's
[Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma] scores. This penalty can't
reduce any of these scores below 1.

   This spell's effect may make it impossible for the target to cast
some or all of its spells, if the requisite ability score drops below
the minimum required to cast spells of that level.

   Transformation

   *Transformation*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a _potion of [bull's strength]_, which you
drink and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   You become a fighting machine--stronger, tougher, faster, and more
skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and
you can't cast spells, even from magic items.

   You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to [Strength], [Dexterity], and
[Constitution], a +4 natural armor bonus to [AC], a +5 competence bonus
on [Fortitude] saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial
weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may
give you multiple attacks).

   You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use
spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells
were no longer on your class list.

   Transmute Metal to Wood

   *Transmute Metal to Wood*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area* all metal objects within a 40-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*
yes (object; see text)

   This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area
to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by creatures
are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has
[spell resistance] equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell.
Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood
take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The armor bonus of any
armor converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by
this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and
armor changed by this spell loses an additional point of armor bonus
every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.

   Only _[limited wish], [miracle], [wish],_or similar magic can
restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.

   Transmute Mud to Rock

   *Transmute Mud to Rock*

   *School* transmutation [earth]; *Level* druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (sand, lime, and water)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell permanently transforms normal mud or quicksand of any
depth into soft stone (sandstone or a similar mineral).

   Any creature in the mud is allowed a [Reflex] save to escape before
the area is hardened to stone.

   _Transmute mud to rock_counters and dispels _[transmute rock to
mud]_.

   Transmute Rock to Mud

   *Transmute Rock to Mud*

   *School* transmutation [earth]; *Level* druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (clay and water)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

   *Duration* permanent; see text

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into
an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The
depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to
levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip-
or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on
attack rolls and [AC]. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud
can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large
enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5
feet.

   If _transmute rock to mud_is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or
tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth
of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of
bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area,
or half damage to those who succeed on [Reflex] saves.

   Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect
of the spell, since _transmute rock to mud_can't affect worked stone
and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations.
However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations
shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.

   The mud remains until a successful _[dispel magic]_or _[transmute
mud to rock]_spell restores its substance--but not necessarily its
form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days.
The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal
drainage.

   _Transmute rock to mud_counters and dispels _[transmute mud to
rock]_.

   Transport via Plants

   *Transport via Plants*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* druid 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* unlimited

   *Target* you and touched objects or other touched willing creatures

   *Duration* 1 round

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You can enter any normal plant (equal to your size or larger) and
pass any distance to a plant of the same kind in a single round,
regardless of the distance separating the two. The plants must be
alive. The destination plant need not be familiar to you. If you are
uncertain of the location of a particular kind of destination plant,
you need merely designate direction and distance and the _transport via
plants_spell moves you as close as possible to the desired location. If
a particular destination plant is desired but the plant is not living,
the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry plant.

   You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed
your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or
smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or
its equivalent per three caster levels. Use the following equivalents
to determine the maximum number of larger creatures you can bring
along: a Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature
counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be
transported by the spell must be in physical contact with one another,
and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

   You can't use this spell to travel through plant creatures.

   The destruction of an occupied plant slays you and any creatures you
have brought along, and ejects the bodies and all carried objects from
it.

   Trap the Soul

   *Trap the Soul*

   *School* conjuration (summoning); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action or see text

   *Components* V, S, M (gem worth 1,000 gp per HD of the trapped
creature)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* permanent; see text

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes; see text

   _Trap the soul_forces a creature's life force (and its material
body) into a gem. The gem holds the trapped entity indefinitely or
until the gem is broken and the life force is released, which allows
the material body to reform. If the trapped creature is a powerful
creature from another plane, it can be required to perform a service
immediately upon being freed. Otherwise, the creature can go free once
the gem imprisoning it is broken.

   Depending on the version selected, the spell can be triggered in one
of two ways.

   _Spell Completion_: First, the spell can be completed by speaking
its final word as a standard action as if you were casting a regular
spell at the subject. This allows [spell resistance] (if any) and a
[Will] save to avoid the effect. If the creature's name is spoken as
well, any [spell resistance] is ignored and the save DC increases by 2.
If the save or [spell resistance] is successful, the gem shatters.

   _Trigger Object_: The second method is far more insidious, for it
tricks the subject into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the
final spell word, automatically placing the creature's soul in the
trap. To use this method, both the creature's name and the trigger word
must be inscribed on the trigger object when the gem is enspelled. A
_[sympathy]_spell can also be placed on the trigger object. As soon as
the subject picks up or accepts the trigger object, its life force is
automatically transferred to the gem without the benefit of [spell
resistance] or a save.

   Tree Shape

   *Tree Shape*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 2, ranger 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   This spell allows you to assume the form of a Large living tree or
shrub or a Large dead tree trunk with a small number of limbs. The
exact type of tree, as well as its appearance, is completely under your
control. Even the closest inspection cannot reveal that the tree in
question is actually a magically concealed creature. To all normal
tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a _[detect
magic]_spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree
form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you
were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain
unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to [AC] but have an
effective [Dexterity] score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune
to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or
worn changes with you. You can dismiss _tree shape_as a free action
(instead of as a standard action).

   Tree Stride

   *Tree Stride*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* druid 5, ranger 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 hour/level or until expended; see text

   When you cast this spell, you gain the ability to step into a tree,
magically infusing yourself with the plant. Once within a tree, you can
teleport from that particular tree to another tree. The trees you enter
must be of the same kind, must be living, and must have girth at least
equal to yours. By moving into an oak tree (for example), you instantly
know the location of all other oak trees within transport range (see
below) and may choose whether you want to pass into one or simply step
back out of the tree you moved into. You may choose to pass to any tree
of the appropriate kind within the transport range as shown on the
following table.

Type of Tree      Transport Range
------------------------------------ 
Oak, ash, yew     3,000 feet
Elm, linden       2,000 feet
Other deciduous   1,500 feet
Any coniferous    1,000 feet

   You may move into a tree up to one time per caster level (passing
from one tree to another counts only as moving into one tree). The
spell lasts until the duration expires or you exit a tree. Each
transport is a full-round action.

   You can, at your option, remain within a tree without transporting
yourself, but you are forced out when the spell ends. If the tree in
which you are concealed is chopped down or burned, you are slain if you
do not exit before the process is complete.

   True Resurrection

   *True Resurrection*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 9

   *Casting Time*: 10 minutes

   *Components*V, S, M, DF (diamond worth 25,000 gp)

   This spell functions like _[raise dead],_except that you can
resurrect a creature that has been dead for as long as 10 years per
caster level. This spell can even bring back creatures whose bodies
have been destroyed, provided that you unambiguously identify the
deceased in some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of
birth or death is the most common method).

   Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored
to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no [negative levels] (or
[Constitution] points) and all of the prepared spells possessed by the
creature when it died.

   You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who has
been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. This spell can
also resurrect elementals or outsiders, but it can't resurrect
constructs or undead creatures.

   Even _true resurrection_can't restore to life a creature who has
died of old age.

   True Seeing

   *True Seeing*

   *School* divination; *Level* cleric 5, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (an eye ointment that costs 250 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   You confer on the subject the ability to see all things as they
actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness,
notices secret doors hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of
creatures or objects under _[blur]_or _[displacement]_effects, sees
[invisible] creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and
sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things.
Further, the subject can focus its vision to see into the Ethereal
Plane (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of _true
seeing_conferred is 120 feet.

   _True seeing_, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no
way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate
concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. _True
seeing_does not help the viewer see through mundane disguises, spot
creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors hidden by
mundane means. In addition, the spell effects cannot be further
enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use _true seeing_through a
_crystal ball_or in conjunction with _[clairaudience/clairvoyance]_.

   True Strike

   *True Strike*

   *School* divination; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, F (small wooden replica of an archery target)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* see text

   You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future
during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made
before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus.
Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to
attackers trying to strike a concealed target.

1 Playing the Game
******************

While playing the PF RPG_,_the Game Master describes the events that
occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what
their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling,
however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by
the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are
not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with
some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better
at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based
on his skills and abilities.

   Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as “d#,” with the “#”
representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll
multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the “d.”
For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four
six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a
+ or - after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or
subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual
die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of
modifiers based on the character's skills, his or her abilities, and
the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling
low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You
can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently
colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens
digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit
rolls a “4” and the other d10 rolls a “2,” then you've generated a 42.
A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if
both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with “10,” “20,”
“30,” and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless
otherwise noted, whenever you are must round a number, always round
down.

   As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items,
and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment,
while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your
character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and
completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough
experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting
him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater
challenges.

* The Most Important Rule::


File: test.info,  Node: The Most Important Rule,  Up: Playing the Game

1.1 The Most Important Rule
===========================

The rules presented are here to help you breathe life into your
characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make
your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not
suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that
these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game
Masters have a number of “house rules” that they use in their games.
The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to
make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played.
Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the PF RPG
is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their
thoughts when the rules are in doubt.


File: test.info,  Node: Common Terms,  Next: Generating a Character,  Prev: Playing the Game,  Up: Top

2 Common Terms
**************

The PF RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in
presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most
common.

   *Ability Score*: Each creature has six ability scores: [Strength],
[Dexterity], [Constitution], [Intelligence], [Wisdom], and [Charisma].
These scores represent a creature's most basic attributes. The higher
the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.

   *Action*: An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round
of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all
require actions to perform. There are a number of different kinds of
actions, such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free
action, and full-round action (see [Combat]).

   *Alignment*: Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and
ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether
a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that
describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are
usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component,
such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that
are neutral in both components are denoted by a single “N.”

   *Armor Class (AC)*: All creatures in the game have an Armor Class.
This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As
with other scores, higher is better.

   *Base Attack Bonus (BAB)*: Each creature has a base attack bonus and
it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit
Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature's base attack
bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in
combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of
full-round action--see [Combat]).

   *Bonus*: Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and
statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule,
bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not “stack”)--only the
greater bonus granted applies.

   *Caster Level (CL)*: Caster level represents a creature's power and
ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often
contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based
on the caster's level.

   *Class*: Classes represent chosen professions taken by characters
and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow
characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as
casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given
class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in
the [core classes] or [prestige classes], since these are the most
powerful. Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful
).

   *Check*: A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by
another value. The most common types are attack rolls, ability checks,
skill checks, and saving throws.

   *Combat Maneuver*: This is an action taken in combat that does not
directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him,
disarm him, or grapple with him (see [Combat]).

   *Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB)*: This value represents how skilled a
creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform
a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character's d20 roll.

   *Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD)*: This score represents how hard it
is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature's CMD
is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that
creature.

   *Concentration Check*: When a creature is casting a spell, but is
disrupted during the casting, he must make a concentration check or
fail to cast the spell ).

   *Creature*: A creature is an active participant in the story or
world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.

   *Damage Reduction (DR)*: Creatures that are resistant to harm
typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any
damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be
bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a “/” followed
by the type, such as “10/cold iron.” Some types of DR apply to all
physical attacks. Such DR is denoted by the “--” symbol. See *note
Special Abilities: #special-abilities. for more information.

   *Difficulty Class (DC)*: Whenever a creature attempts to perform an
action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check
(usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed
the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to
perform in order for the action to be successful.

   *Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)*: Extraordinary abilities are unusual
abilities that do not rely on magic to function.

   *Experience Points (XP)*: As a character overcomes challenges,
defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points.
These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a
specific value, the character gains a level.

   *Feat*: A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often
allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive
a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other
abilities grant bonus feats.

   *Game Master (GM)*: A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the
rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the
players explore. A GM's duty is to provide a fair and fun game.

   *Hit Dice (HD)*: Hit Dice represent a creature's general level of
power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit
Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which
represent the monster's general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are
represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of
die, such as “3d8.” This value is used to determine a creature's total
hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling
for this creature's hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add
the results together, along with other modifiers.

   *Hit Points (hp)*: Hit points are an abstraction signifying how
robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a
creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A
creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a
character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC
class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds
subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores
hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that
disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop
below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature's hit points reach a
negative total equal to its [Constitution] score, it dies.

   *Initiative*: Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the
battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which
creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the
earlier a creature gets to act.

   *Level*: A character's level represents his overall ability and
power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of
levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is
the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his
classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered
from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a
spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.

   *Monster*: Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice
instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some
possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.

   *Multiplying*: When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier
to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead,
you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple
adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you
are asked to apply a ×2 multiplier twice, the result would be ×3, not
×4.

   *Nonplayer Character (NPC)*: These are characters controlled by the
GM.

   *Penalty*: Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a
check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most
penalties stack with one another.

   *Player Character (Character, PC)*: These are the characters
portrayed by the players.

   *Round*: Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round,
all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of
initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.

   *Rounding*: Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or
value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you
are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.

   *Saving Throw*: When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell
or effect, it often receives a saving throw to mitigate the damage or
result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not
need to take an action to make a saving throw--they are made
automatically. There are three types of saving throws: [Fortitude]
(used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), [Reflex]
(used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as _fireball_),
and [Will] (used to resist mental attacks and spells).

   *Skill*: A skill represents a creature's ability to perform an
ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an
intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill
represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice,
it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.

   *Spell*: Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming
enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can
target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.

   *Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)*: Spell-like abilities function just like
spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a
specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by
spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).

   *Spell Resistance (SR)*: Some creatures are resistant to magic and
gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is
targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level
check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is
equal to the target creature's SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).

   *Stacking*: Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or
penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally
speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the
highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their
values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with
one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or
all of the bonuses, and vice versa.

   *Supernatural Abilities (Su)*: Supernatural abilities are magical
attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active
or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural
ability's description includes information on how it is used and its
effects.

   *Turn*: In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it
can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one
turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one
swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of
actions are permissible as well, see [Combat] for more details.

3 Generating a Character
************************

From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the PF RPG allows you to
make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start
with your character's concept. Do you want a character who goes
toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against
claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers
from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is
possible.

   Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps
to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and
statistics on your PF RPG character sheet, which can be found at the
back of this book and photocopied for your convenience.

   *Step 1--Determine [Ability Score]s*: Start by generating your
character's [ability score]s. These six scores determine your
character's most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety
of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have
better than average scores for some of your abilities.

   *Step 2--Pick Your [Race]*: Next, pick your character's race, noting
any modifiers to your [ability score]s and any other racial traits (see
[Races]). There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM
might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages
your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus
languages. A character knows a number of additional bonus languages
equal to his or her [Intelligence] modifier.

   *Step 3--Pick Your [Class]*: A character's class represents a
profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he
starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points
(XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new
powers and abilities.

   *Step 4--Pick *note Skills: #skills. and Select *note Feats:
#feats.*: Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your
character, based on his class and [Intelligence] modifier (and any
other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these
ranks on skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your
level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one).
After skills, determine how many feats your character receives, based
on his class and level, and select them from those presented in *note
Feats: #feats.

   *Step 5--Buy [Equipment]*: Each new character begins the game with
an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide
range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks.
This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally
speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without
the consent of your GM.

   *Step 6--Finishing Details*: Finally, you need to determine all of a
character's details, including his starting [hit points] (hp), *note
Armor Class: #armor-class. ), [saving throws], [initiative modifier],
and [attack values]. All of these numbers are determined by the
decisions made in previous steps. Aside from these, you need to decide
on your character's name, [alignment], and physical appearance. It is
best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the
character during the game. Additional rules (like age and alignment)
are described in [Additional Rules].

4 Ability Scores
****************

Each character has six ability scores that represent his character's
most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a
character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these
scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a
character's skills and abilities. Each ability score generally ranges
from 3 to 18, although racial bonuses and penalties can alter this; an
average ability score is 10.

4.1 Generating Ability Scores
=============================

There are a number of different methods used to generate [ability
score]s. Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility
and randomness to character generation.

   Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your [ability score]s due to
your character's race--see [Races]) are applied after the scores are
generated.

   *Standard:* Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the
three remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the
process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your
[ability score]s as you see fit. This method is less random than
Classic and tends to create characters with above-average [ability
score]s.

   *Classic:* Roll 3d6 and add the dice together. Record this total and
repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these results
to your [ability score]s as you see fit. This method is quite random,
and some characters will have clearly superior abilities. This
randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to
specific [ability score]s in the order they are rolled. Characters
generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined
concepts, as their scores might not support given classes or
personalities, and instead are best designed around their [ability
score]s.

   *Heroic:* Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of the dice. Record this
total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign
these totals to your [ability score]s as you see fit. This is less
random than the Standard method and generates characters with mostly
above-average scores.

   *Dice Pool:*Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his
statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number
of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability.
Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and
totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered
games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This
method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.

   : Table: Ability Score Points

*Purchase:* Each character receives a number of points to spend on
increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start
at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by
spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend
on other scores by decreasing one or more of his [ability score]s. No
score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. [See
Table: Ability Score Costs] for the costs of each score. After all the
points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.

   The number of points you have to spend using the purchase method
depends on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for
a character is 15 points. Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are
typically built using as few as 3 points. [See Table: Ability Score
Points] for a number of possible point values depending on the style of
campaign. The purchase method emphasizes player choice and creates
equally balanced characters. This system is typically used for
organized play events, such as the PF Society (visit
*paizo.com/PFSociety (http://paizo.com/PFSociety)* for more details on
this exciting campaign).

4.1.1 Determine Bonuses
-----------------------

Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier
ranging from -5 to +5. [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]
shows the modifier for each score. The modifier is the number you apply
to the die roll when your character tries to do something related to
that ability. You also use the modifier with some numbers that aren't
die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a negative
modifier is called a penalty. The table also shows bonus spells, which
you'll need to know about if your character is a spellcaster.

4.2 Abilities and Spellcasters
==============================

The ability that governs bonus spells depends on what type of
spellcaster your character is: [Intelligence] for wizards; [Wisdom] for
clerics, druids, and rangers; and [Charisma] for bards, paladins, and
sorcerers. In addition to having a high [ability score], a spellcaster
must be of a high enough class level to be able to cast spells of a
given spell level. See the class descriptions in *note Classes:
#classes. for details.

4.3 The Abilities
=================

Each ability partially describes your character and affects some of his
actions.

* Dexterity Dex::
* Constitution Con::
* Intelligence Int::
* Wisdom Wis::
* Charisma Cha::


File: test.info,  Node: Strength,  Next: Dexterity Dex,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.1 Strength )
----------------

Strength measures muscle and physical power. This ability is important
for those who engage in hand-to-hand (or “melee”) combat, such as
fighters, monks, paladins, and some rangers. Strength also sets the
maximum amount of weight your character can carry. A character with a
Strength score of 0 is too weak to move in any way and is unconscious.
Some creatures do not possess a Strength score and have no modifier at
all to Strength-based skills or checks.

   You apply your character's Strength modifier to:

   * [Melee attack] rolls.

   * *note Damage: #damage. rolls when using a melee weapon or a thrown
     weapon, including a sling. (Exceptions: Off-hand attacks receive
     only half the character's Strength bonus, while two-handed attacks
     receive 1-1/2 times the Strength bonus. A Strength penalty, but
     not a bonus, applies to attacks made with a bow that is not a
     composite bow.)

   * *note Climb: #climb. and *note Swim: #swim. checks. Strength
     checks (for breaking down doors and the like).


File: test.info,  Node: Dexterity Dex,  Next: Constitution Con,  Prev: Strength,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.2 Dexterity (Dex)
---------------------

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the
most important one for rogues, but it's also useful for characters who
wear light or medium armor or no armor at all. This ability is vital
for characters seeking to excel with ranged weapons, such as the bow or
sling. A character with a Dexterity score of 0 is incapable of moving
and is effectively immobile (but not unconscious).

   You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:

   * [Ranged attack] rolls, including those for attacks made with bows,
     crossbows, throwing axes, and many ranged spell attacks like
     _scorching ray_ or _searing light_.

   * *note Armor Class: #armor-class. ), provided that the character
     can react to the attack.

   * [Reflex saving throws], for avoiding _fireballs_ and other attacks
     that you can escape by moving quickly.

   * *note Acrobatics: #acrobatics, *note Disable Device:
     #disable-device, *note Escape Artist: #escape-artist, *note Fly:
     #fly, *note Ride: #ride, *note Sleight of Hand: #sleight-of-hand,
     and *note Stealth: #stealth. checks.


File: test.info,  Node: Constitution Con,  Next: Intelligence Int,  Prev: Dexterity Dex,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.3 Constitution (Con)
------------------------

Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A
Constitution bonus increases a character's hit points, so the ability
is important for all classes. Some creatures, such as undead and
constructs, do not have a Constitution score. Their modifier is +0 for
any Constitution-based checks. A character with a Constitution score of
0 is dead.

   You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:

   * Each roll of a [Hit Die] (though a penalty can never drop a result
     below 1--that is, a character always gains at least 1 hit point
     each time he advances in level).

   * [Fortitude saving throws], for resisting poison, disease, and
     similar threats.

   If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or
her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or
decrease accordingly.


File: test.info,  Node: Intelligence Int,  Next: Wisdom Wis,  Prev: Constitution Con,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.4 Intelligence (Int)
------------------------

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons.
This ability is important for wizards because it affects their
spellcasting ability in many ways. Creatures of animal-level instinct
have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2. Any creature capable of
understanding speech has a score of at least 3. A character with an
Intelligence score of 0 is comatose. Some creatures do not possess an
Intelligence score. Their modifier is +0 for any Intelligence-based
skills or checks.

   You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:

   * The number of bonus [languages] your character knows at the start
     of the game. These are in addition to any starting racial
     languages and Common. If you have a penalty, you can still read
     and speak your racial languages unless your Intelligence is lower
     than 3.

   * The number of skill points gained each level, though your
     character always gets at least 1 skill point per level.

   * *note Appraise: #appraise, *note Craft: #craft, *note Knowledge:
     #knowledge, *note Linguistics: #linguistics, and *note Spellcraft:
     #spellcraft. checks.

   A [wizard] gains bonus spells based on his Intelligence score. The
minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the
spell's level.


File: test.info,  Node: Wisdom Wis,  Next: Charisma Cha,  Prev: Intelligence Int,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.5 Wisdom (Wis)
------------------

Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, awareness, and
intuition. Wisdom is the most important ability for clerics and druids,
and it is also important for paladins and rangers. If you want your
character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every
creature has a Wisdom score. A character with a Wisdom score of 0 is
incapable of rational thought and is unconscious.

   You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:

   * [Will saving throws] (for negating the effects of _charm person_
     and other spells).

   * *note Heal: #heal, *note Perception: #perception, *note
     Profession: #profession, *note Sense Motive: #sense-motive, and
     *note Survival: #survival. checks.

   [Clerics], [druids], and [rangers] get bonus spells based on their
Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid,
or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.


File: test.info,  Node: Charisma Cha,  Prev: Wisdom Wis,  Up: The Abilities

4.3.6 Charisma (Cha)
--------------------

Charisma measures a character's personality, personal magnetism,
ability to lead, and appearance. It is the most important ability for
paladins, sorcerers, and bards. It is also important for clerics, since
it affects their ability to channel energy. For undead creatures,
Charisma is a measure of their unnatural “lifeforce.” Every creature
has a Charisma score. A character with a Charisma score of 0 is not
able to exert himself in any way and is unconscious.

   You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:

   * *note Bluff: #bluff, *note Diplomacy: #diplomacy, *note Disguise:
     #disguise, *note Handle Animal: #handle-animal, *note Intimidate:
     #intimidate, *note Perform: #perform, and *note Use Magic Device:
     #use-magic-device. checks.

   * Checks that represent attempts to influence others.

   * [Channel energy] DCs for [clerics] and [paladins] attempting to
     harm undead foes.

   [Bards], [paladins], and [sorcerers] gain a number of bonus spells
based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to
cast a bard, paladin, or sorcerer spell is 10 + the spell's level.

5 Designing Encounters
**********************

The heart of any adventure is its encounters. An encounter is any event
that puts a specific problem before the PCs that they must solve. Most
encounters present combat with monsters or hostile NPCs, but there are
many other types--a trapped corridor, a political interaction with a
suspicious king, a dangerous passage over a rickety rope bridge, an
awkward argument with a friendly NPC who suspects a PC has betrayed
him, or anything that adds drama to the game. Brain-teasing puzzles,
roleplaying challenges, and skill checks are all classic methods for
resolving encounters, but the most complex encounters to build are the
most common ones--combat encounters.

   When designing a combat encounter, you first decide what level of
challenge you want your PCs to face, then follow the steps outlined
below.

   Step 1--Determine APL: Determine the average level of your player
characters--this is their Average Party Level (APL for short). You
should round this value to the nearest whole number (this is one of the
few exceptions to the round down rule). Note that these encounter
creation guidelines assume a group of four or five PCs. If your group
contains six or more players, add one to their average level. If your
group contains three or fewer players, subtract one from their average
level. For example, if your group consists of six players, two of which
are 4th level and four of which are 5th level, their APL is 6th (28
total levels, divided by six players, rounding up, and adding one to
the final result).

   Step 2--Determine CR: Challenge Rating (or CR) is a convenient
number used to indicate the relative danger presented by a monster,
trap, hazard, or other encounter--the higher the CR, the more dangerous
the encounter. Refer to Table: Encounter Design to determine the
Challenge Rating your group should face, depending on the difficulty of
the challenge you want and the group's APL.

   Step 3--Build the Encounter: Determine the total XP award for the
encounter by looking it up by its CR on Table: Experience Point Awards.
This gives you an “XP budget” for the encounter. Every creature, trap,
and hazard is worth an amount of XP determined by its CR, as noted on
Table: Experience Point Awards. To build your encounter, simply add
creatures, traps, and hazards whose combined XP does not exceed the
total XP budget for your encounter. It's easiest to add the highest CR
challenges to the encounter first, filling out the remaining total with
lesser challenges.

   For example, let's say you want your group of six 8th-level PCs to
face a challenging encounter against a group of gargoyles (each CR 4)
and their stone giant boss (CR 8). The PCs have an APL of 9, and table
12-1 tells you that a challenging encounter for your APL 9 group is a
CR 10 encounter--worth 9,600 XP according to Table: Experience Point
Awards. At CR 8, the stone giant is worth 4,800 XP, leaving you with
another 4,800 points in your XP budget for the gargoyles. Gargoyles are
CR 4 each, and thus worth 1,200 XP apiece, meaning that the encounter
can support four gargoyles in its XP budget. You could further refine
the encounter by including only three gargoyles, leaving you with 1,200
XP to spend on a trio of Small earth elemental servants (at CR 1, each
is worth 400 XP) to further aid the stone giant.

   Adding NPCs: Creatures whose Hit Dice are solely a factor of their
class levels and not a feature of their race, such as all of the PC
races detailed in [Races], are factored into combats a little
differently than normal monsters or monsters with class levels. A
creature that possesses class levels, but does not have any racial Hit
Dice, is factored in as a creature with a CR equal to its class levels
-1. A creature that only possesses [non-player class] levels (such as a
warrior or adept) is factored in as a creature with a CR equal to its
class levels -2. If this reduction would reduce a creature's CR to
below 1, its CR drops one step on the following progression for each
step below 1 this reduction would make: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8.

   High CR Encounters: The XP values for high-CR encounters can seem
quite daunting. Table: CR Equivalencies provides some simple formulas
to help you manage these large numbers. When using a large number of
identical creatures, this chart can help simplify the math by combining
them into one CR, making it easier to find their total XP value. For
example, using this chart, four CR 8 creatures (worth 4,800 XP each)
are equivalent to a CR 12 creature (worth 19,200 XP).

   Ad Hoc CR Adjustments: While you can adjust a specific monster's CR
by advancing it, applying templates, or giving it class levels, you can
also adjust an encounter's difficulty by applying ad hoc adjustments to
the encounter or creature itself. Listed here are three additional ways
you can alter an encounter's difficulty.

   Favorable Terrain for the PCs: An encounter against a monster that's
out of its favored element (like a yeti encountered in a sweltering
cave with lava, or an enormous dragon encountered in a tiny room) gives
the PCs an advantage. Build the encounter as normal, but when you award
experience for the encounter, do so as if the encounter were one CR
lower than its actual CR.

   Unfavorable Terrain for the PCs: Monsters are designed with the
assumption that they are encountered in their favored
terrain--encountering a water-breathing aboleth in an underwater area
does not increase the CR for that encounter, even though none of the
PCs breathe water. If, on the other hand, the terrain impacts the
encounter significantly (such as an encounter against a creature with
blindsight in an area that suppresses all light), you can, at your
option, increase the effective XP award as if the encounter's CR were
one higher.

   NPC Gear Adjustments: You can significantly increase or decrease the
power level of an NPC with class levels by adjusting the NPC's gear.
The combined value of an NPC's gear is given in *note Creating NPCs:
#creating-npcs. on Table: NPC Gear. A classed NPC encountered with no
gear should have his CR reduced by 1 (provided that loss of gear
actually hampers the NPC), while a classed NPC that instead has gear
equivalent to that of a PC (as listed on Table: Character Wealth by
Level) has a CR of 1 higher than his actual CR. Be careful awarding
NPCs this extra gear, though--especially at high levels, where you can
blow out your entire adventure's treasure budget in one fell swoop!

5.1 Awarding Experience
=======================

PF Roleplaying Game characters advance in level by defeating monsters,
overcoming challenges, and completing adventures--in so doing, they
earn experience points (XP for short). Although you can award
experience points as soon as a challenge is overcome, this can quickly
disrupt the flow of game play. It's easier to simply award experience
points at the end of a game session--that way, if a character earns
enough XP to gain a level, he won't disrupt the game while he levels up
his character. He can instead take the time between game sessions to do
that.

   Keep a list of the CRs of all the monsters, traps, obstacles, and
roleplaying encounters the PCs overcome. At the end of each session,
award XP to each PC that participated. Each monster, trap, and obstacle
awards a set amount of XP, as determined by its CR, regardless of the
level of the party in relation to the challenge, although you should
never bother awarding XP for challenges that have a CR of 10 or more
lower than the APL. Pure roleplaying encounters generally have a CR
equal to the average level of the party (although particularly easy or
difficult roleplaying encounters might be one higher or lower). There
are two methods for awarding XP. While one is more exact, it requires a
calculator for ease of use. The other is slightly more abstract.

   Exact XP: Once the game session is over, take your list of defeated
CR numbers and look up the value of each CR on Table: Experience Point
Awards under the “Total XP” column. Add up the XP values for each CR
and then divide this total by the number of characters--each character
earns an amount of XP equal to this number.

   Abstract XP: Simply add up the individual XP awards listed for a
group of the appropriate size. In this case, the division is done for
you--you need only total up all the awards to determine how many XP to
award to each PC.

   Story Awards: Feel free to award Story Awards when players conclude
a major storyline or make an important accomplishment. These awards
should be worth double the amount of experience points for a CR equal
to the APL. Particularly long or difficult story arcs might award even
more, at your discretion as GM.

   As PCs gain levels, the amount of treasure they carry and use
increases as well. The PF Roleplaying Game assumes that all PCs of
equivalent level have roughly equal amounts of treasure and magic
items. Since the primary income for a PC derives from treasure and loot
gained from adventuring, it's important to moderate the wealth and
hoards you place in your adventures. To aid in placing treasure, the
amount of treasure and magic items the PCs receive for their adventures
is tied to the Challenge Rating of the encounters they face--the higher
an encounter's CR, the more treasure it can award.

   Table: Character Wealth by Level lists the amount of treasure each
PC is expected to have at a specific level. Note that this table
assumes a standard fantasy game. Low-fantasy games might award only
half this value, while high-fantasy games might double the value. It is
assumed that some of this treasure is consumed in the course of an
adventure (such as potions and scrolls), and that some of the less
useful items are sold for half value so more useful gear can be
purchased.

   Table: Character Wealth by Level can also be used to budget gear for
characters starting above 1st level, such as a new character created to
replace a dead one. Characters should spend no more than half their
total wealth on any single item. For a balanced approach, PCs that are
built after 1st level should spend no more than 25% of their wealth on
weapons, 25% on armor and protective devices, 25% on other magic items,
15% on disposable items like potions, scrolls, and wands, and 10% on
ordinary gear and coins. Different character types might spend their
wealth differently than these percentages suggest; for example, arcane
casters might spend very little on weapons but a great deal more on
other magic items and disposable items.

   Table: Treasure Values per Encounter lists the amount of treasure
each encounter should award based on the average level of the PCs and
the speed of the campaign's XP progression (slow, medium, or fast).
Easy encounters should award treasure one level lower than the PCs'
average level. Challenging, hard, and epic encounters should award
treasure one, two, or three levels higher than the PCs' average level,
respectively. If you are running a low-fantasy game, cut these values
in half. If you are running a high-fantasy game, double these values.

   Encounters against NPCs typically award three times the treasure a
monster-based encounter awards, due to NPC gear. To compensate, make
sure the PCs face off against a pair of additional encounters that
award little in the way of treasure. Animals, plants, constructs,
mindless undead, oozes, and traps are great “low treasure” encounters.
Alternatively, if the PCs face a number of creatures with little or no
treasure, they should have the opportunity to acquire a number of
significantly more valuable objects sometime in the near future to make
up for the imbalance. As a general rule, PCs should not own any magic
item worth more than half their total character wealth, so make sure to
check before awarding expensive magic items.

5.3 Building a Treasure Hoard
=============================

While it's often enough to simply tell your players they've found 5,000
gp in gems and 10,000 gp in jewelry, it's generally more interesting to
give details. Giving treasure a personality can not only help the
verisimilitude of your game, but can sometimes trigger new adventures.
The information on the below can help you randomly determine types of
additional treasure--suggested values are given for many of the
objects, but feel free to assign values to the objects as you see fit.
It's easiest to place the expensive items first--if you wish, you can
even randomly roll magic items, using the tables in [Magic Items], to
determine what sort of items are present in the hoard. Once you've
consumed a sizable portion of the hoard's value, the remainder can
simply be loose coins or nonmagical treasure with values arbitrarily
assigned as you see fit.

   Coins: Coins in a treasure hoard can consist of copper, silver,
gold, and platinum pieces--silver and gold are the most common, but you
can divide the coinage as you wish. Coins and their value relative to
each other are described at the start of [Equipment].

   Gems: Although you can assign any value to a gemstone, some are
inherently more valuable than others. Use the value categories below
(and their associated gemstones) as guidelines when assigning values to
gemstones.

   Low-Quality Gems (10 gp): agates; azurite; blue quartz; hematite;
lapis lazuli; malachite; obsidian; rhodochrosite; tigereye; turquoise;
freshwater (irregular) pearl

   Semi-Precious Gems (50 gp): bloodstone; carnelian; chalcedony;
chrysoprase; citrine; jasper; moonstone; onyx; peridot; rock crystal
(clear quartz); sard; sardonyx; rose, smoky, or star rose quartz; zircon

   Medium Quality Gemstones (100 gp): amber; amethyst; chrysoberyl;
coral; red or brown-green garnet; jade; jet; white, golden, pink, or
silver pearl; red, red-brown, or deep green spinel; tourmaline

   High Quality Gemstones (500 gp): alexandrite; aquamarine; violet
garnet; black pearl; deep blue spinel; golden yellow topaz

   Jewels (1,000 gp): emerald; white, black, or fire opal; blue
sapphire; fiery yellow or rich purple corundum; blue or black star
sapphire

   Grand Jewels (5,000 gp or more): clearest bright green emerald;
diamond; jacinth; ruby

   Nonmagical Treasures: This expansive category includes jewelry, fine
clothing, trade goods, alchemical items, masterwork objects, and more.
Unlike gemstones, many of these objects have set values, but you can
always increase an object's value by having it be bejeweled or of
particularly fine craftsmanship. This increase in cost doesn't grant
additional abilities--a gem-encrusted masterwork cold iron scimitar
worth 40,000 gp functions the same as a typical masterwork cold iron
scimitar worth the base price of 330 gp. Listed below are numerous
examples of several types of nonmagical treasures, along with typical
values.

   Fine Artwork (100 gp or more): Although some artwork is composed of
precious materials, the value of most paintings, sculptures, works of
literature, fine clothing, and the like come from their skill and
craftsmanship. Artwork is often bulky or cumbersome to move and fragile
to boot, making salvage an adventure in and of itself.

   Jewelry, Minor (50 gp): This category includes relatively small
pieces of jewelry crafted from materials like brass, bronze, copper,
ivory, or even exotic woods, sometimes set with tiny or flawed
low-quality gems. Minor jewelry includes rings, bracelets, and earrings.

   Jewelry, Normal (100-500 gp): Most jewelry is made of silver, gold,
jade, or coral, often ornamented with semi-precious or even
medium-quality gemstones. Normal jewelry includes all types of minor
jewelry plus armbands, necklaces, and brooches.

   Jewelry, Precious (500 gp or more): Truly precious jewelry is
crafted from gold, mithral, platinum, or similar rare metals. Such
objects include normal jewelry types plus crowns, scepters, pendants,
and other large items.

   Masterwork Tools (100-300 gp): This category includes masterwork
weapons, armor, and skill kits--see [Equipment] for more details and
costs for these items.

   Mundane Gear (up to 1,000 gp): There are many valuable items of
mundane or alchemical nature detailed in [Equipment] that can be
utilized as treasure. Most of the alchemical items are portable and
valuable, but other objects like locks, holy symbols, spyglasses, fine
wine, or fine clothing work well as interesting bits of treasure. Trade
goods can even serve as treasure--10 pounds of saffron, for example, is
worth 150 gp.

   Treasure Maps and Other Intelligence (variable): Items like treasure
maps, deeds to ships and homes, lists of informants or guard rosters,
passwords, and the like can also make fun items of treasure--you can
set the value of such items at any amount you wish, and often they can
serve double-duty as adventure seeds.

   Magic Items: Of course, the discovery of a magic item is the true
prize for any adventurer. You should take care with the placement of
magic items in a hoard--it's generally more satisfying for many players
to find a magic item rather than purchase it, so there's no crime in
placing items that happen to be those your players can use! An
extensive list of magic items (and their costs) is given in [Magic
Items].

Magic Item Category   Average Value
-------------------------------------- 
Minor Item            1,000 gp
Medium Item           10,000 gp
Major Item            40,000 gp

   Although you should generally place items with careful consideration
of their likely effects on your campaign, it can be fun and save time
to generate magic items in a treasure hoard randomly. You can
“purchase” random die rolls of magic items for a treasure hoard at the
following prices, subtracting the indicated amount from your treasure
budget and then rolling on the appropriate column on table 15-2 in
[Magic Items] to determine what item is in the treasure hoard. Take
care with this approach, though! It's easy, through the luck (or
unluck) of the dice to bloat your game with too much treasure or
deprive it of the same. Random magic item placement should always be
tempered with good common sense by the GM.

6 Cost of Living
****************

An adventurer's primary source of income is treasure, and his primary
purchases are tools and items he needs to continue adventuring--spell
components, weapons, magic items, potions, and the like. Yet what about
things like food? Rent? Taxes? Bribes? Idle purchases?

   You can certainly handle these minor expenditures in detail during
play, but tracking every time a PC pays for a room, buys water, or pays
a gate tax can swiftly become obnoxious and tiresome. If you're not
really into tracking these minor costs of living, you can choose to
simply ignore these small payments. A more realistic and easier-to-use
method is to have PCs pay a recurring cost of living tax. At the start
of every game month, a PC must pay an amount of gold equal to the
lifestyle bracket he wishes to live in--if he can't afford his desired
bracket, he drops down to the first one he can afford.

   Destitute (0 gp/month): The PC is homeless and lives in the
wilderness or on the streets. A destitute character must track every
purchase, and may need to resort to Survival checks or theft to feed
himself.

   Poor (3 gp/month): The PC lives in common rooms of taverns, with his
parents, or in some other communal situation--this is the lifestyle of
most untrained laborers and commoners. He need not track purchases of
meals or taxes that cost 1 sp or less.

   Average (10 gp/month): The PC lives in his own apartment, small
house, or similar location--this is the lifestyle of most trained or
skilled experts or warriors. He can secure any nonmagical item worth 1
gp or less from his home in 1d10 minutes, and need not track purchases
of common meals or taxes that cost 1 gp or less.

   Wealthy (100 gp/month): The PC has a sizable home or a nice suite of
rooms in a fine inn. He can secure any nonmagical item worth 5 gp or
less from his belongings in his home in 1d10 minutes, and need only
track purchases of meals or taxes in excess of 10 gp.

   Extravagant (1,000 gp/month): The PC lives in a mansion, castle, or
other extravagant home--he might even own the building in question.
This is the lifestyle of most aristocrats. He can secure any nonmagical
item worth 25 gp or less from his belongings in his home in 1d10
minutes. He need only track purchases of meals or taxes in excess of
100 gp.

7 Beyond 20th Level
*******************

Although *note Classes: #classes. doesn't describe what happens after
20th level, this isn't to say that there are no resources available to
you should you wish to continue your campaign on to 21st level and
beyond. Rules for epic-level play like this exist in numerous products
that are compatible with the PF Roleplaying Game, although in many
cases these alternative rules can provide unanticipated problems. For
example, if your campaign world is populated by creatures and villains
who, at the upper limit of power, can challenge a 20th-level character,
where will epic-level PCs go for challenges? You might be looking at
creating an entirely new campaign setting, one set on different planes,
planets, or dimensions from the one where your players spent their
first 20 levels, and that's a lot of work.

   Paizo Publishing may eventually publish rules to take your game into
these epic realms, but if you can't wait and would rather not use
existing open content rules for epic-level play, you can use the
following brief guidelines to continue beyond 20th level. Note that
these guidelines aren't robust enough to keep the game vibrant and
interesting on their own for much longer past 20th level, but they
should do in a pinch for a campaign that needs, say, 22 or 23
experience levels to wrap up. Likewise, you can use these rules to
create super-powerful NPCs for 20th-level characters to face.

   Experience Points: To gain a level beyond 20th, a character must
double the experience points needed to achieve the previous level.
Thus, assuming the medium XP progression, a 20th-level character needs
2,100,000 XP to become 21st level, since he needed 1,050,000 XP to
reach 20th level from 19th. He'd then need 4,200,000 XP to reach 22nd
level, 8,400,000 XP to reach 23rd, and so on.

   Scaling Powers: Hit dice, base attack bonuses, and saving throws
continue to increase at the same rate beyond 20th level, as appropriate
for the class in question. Note that no character can have more than 4
attacks based on its base attack bonus. Note also that, before long,
the difference between good saving throws and poor saving throws
becomes awkwardly large--the further you get from 20th level, the more
noticeable this difference grows, and for high-level characters,
bolstering their poor saving throws should become increasingly
important. Class abilities that have a set, increasing rate, such as a
barbarian's damage reduction, a fighter's bonus feats and weapon
training, a paladin's smite evil, or a rogue's sneak attack continue to
progress at the appropriate rate.

   Spells: A spellcaster's caster level continues to increase by one
for each level beyond 20th level. Every odd-numbered level, a
spellcaster gains access to a new level of spell one above his previous
maximum level, gaining one spell slot in that new level. These spell
slots can be used to prepare or cast spells adjusted by metamagic feats
or any known spell of lower levels. Every even-numbered level, a
spellcaster gains additional spell slots equal to the highest level
spell he can currently cast. He can split these new slots any way he
wants among the slots he currently has access to.

   For example, a 21st-level wizard gains a single 10th-level spell
slot, in which he can prepare any spell of level 1st through 9th, or in
which he can prepare a metamagic spell that results in an effective
spell level of 10 (such as extended summon monster IX, or quickened
disintegrate). At 22nd level he gains 10 spell-levels' worth of new
spell slots, and can gain 10 1st-level spells per day, two 5th-level
spells per day, one 7th-level and one 3rd-level spell per day, or one
more 10th-level spell per day. At 23rd level, he gains a single
11th-level spell slot, and so on.

   Spellcasters who have a limited number of spells known (such as
bards and sorcerers) can opt out of the benefits they gain (either a
new level of spells or a number of spell slots) for that level and in
exchange learn two more spells of any level they can currently cast.

   You might want to further adjust the rate of spell level gain for
classes (like paladins and rangers) who gain spells more slowly than
more dedicated spellcaster classes.

   Multiclassing/Prestige Classes: The simplest way to progress beyond
20th level is to simply multiclass or take levels in a prestige class,
in which case you gain all of the abilities of the new class level
normally. This effectively treats 20th level as a hard limit for class
level, but not as a hard limit for total character level.

8.2 Class Features
==================

All of the following are class features of the adept NPC class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Adepts are skilled with all simple
weapons. Adepts are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.

   *Spells*: An adept casts divine spells, which are drawn from the
adept spell list. Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare her
spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously cast
_cure_ or _inflict_ spells.

   To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a [Wisdom] score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a
saving throw against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the
adept's [Wisdom] modifier.

   Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or
scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate
or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or
through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each
day during which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or
supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent
resting has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.

   Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table 14-1. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if
she has a high [Wisdom] score.

   Where Table 14-1 indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of a
given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be
entitled to based on her [Wisdom] score for that spell level.

   Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus)
depending on the adept's magical tradition.

   *Summon Familiar*: At 2nd level, an adept can call a [familiar],
just as a wizard can using the arcane bond ability.

12.2 Class Features
===================

The following is a class feature of the warrior NPC class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: The warrior is proficient in the use
of all simple and martial weapons and with all types of armor and
shields.

   *Fabricate*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* see text

   *Components* V, S, M (the original material, which costs the same
amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be created)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* up to 10 cu. ft./level; see text

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the same
material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or transmuted by
the _fabricate_spell. The quality of items made by this spell is
commensurate with the quality of material used as the basis for the new
fabrication. If you work with a mineral, the target is reduced to 1
cubic foot per level instead of 10 cubic feet.

   You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles
requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

   Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be
affected by the spell.

   Faerie Fire

   *Faerie Fire*

   *School* evocation [light]; *Level* druid 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area* creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects
shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by _faerie fire_ take a -20
penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from
the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or
higher magical _darkness_effect functions normally), _[blur]_,
_[displacement], [invisibility],_ or similar effects. The light is too
dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures
vulnerable to light. The _faerie fire_can be blue, green, or violet,
according to your choice at the time of casting. The _faerie fire_does
not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

   False Life

   *False Life*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of blood)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text

   You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited ability
to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain temporary hit
points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum +10).

   False Vision

   *False Vision*

   *School* illusion (glamer); *Level* bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (crushed jade worth 250 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Area* 40-ft.-radius emanation

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell creates a subtle illusion, causing any divination
(scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this spell to
instead receive a false image (as the _[major image]_spell), as defined
by you at the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can
concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren't
concentrating, the image remains static.

   Fear

   *Fear*

   *School* necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (the heart of a hen or a white feather)

   *Range* 30 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the area
to become [panicked] unless it succeeds on a [Will] save. If cornered,
a [panicked] creature begins cowering. If the [Will] save succeeds, the
creature is [shaken] for 1 round.

   Feather Fall

   *Feather Fall*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 immediate action

   *Components* V

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one Medium or smaller freefalling object or
creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart

   *Duration* until landing or 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless) or [Will] negates (object);
**note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. _Feather
fall_instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60
feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and
the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect.
When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

   The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including
gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or
objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or
object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or
object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.

   This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are
falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the
object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for
the height of the drop.

   _Feather fall_works only upon free-falling objects. It does not
affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

   Feeblemind

   *Feeblemind*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, or glass spheres)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Target creature's [Intelligence] and [Charisma] scores each drop to
1. The affected creature is unable to use [Intelligence]- or
[Charisma]-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or
communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can
follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state
until a _[heal]_, _[limited wish]_, _[miracle]_, or _[wish]_spell is
used to cancel the effect of the _feeblemind_. A creature that can cast
arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a -4 penalty on
its saving throw.

   Find the Path

   *Find the Path*

   *School*divination; *Level*bard 6, cleric 6, druid 6

   *Casting Time*3 rounds

   *Components*V, S, F (a set of divination counters)

   *Range*personal or touch

   *Target*you or creature touched

   *Duration*10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*none or [Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.*no or yes (harmless)

   The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a prominent specified destination, such as a city,
keep, lake, or dungeon. The locale can be outdoors or underground, as
long as it is prominent. For example, a hunter's cabin is not prominent
enough, but a logging camp is. _Find the path_works with respect to
locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be
on the same plane as the subject at the time of casting.

   The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that
will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate
times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For
example, the spell enables the subject to sense what cavern corridor to
take when a choice presents itself_._The spell ends when the
destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first.
_Find the path_can be used to remove the subject and its companions
from the effect of a _[maze]_spell in a single round, specifying the
destination as “outside the [maze].” This divination is keyed to the
recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow
for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take
action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this
spell.

   Find Traps

   *Find Traps*

   *School* divination; *Level* cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You gain an
insight bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on
Perception checks made to find traps while the spell is in effect. You
receive a check to notice traps within 10 feet of you, even if you are
not actively searching for them. Note that _find traps_grants no
ability to disable the traps that you may find.

   Finger of Death

   *Finger of Death*

   *School* necromancy [death]; *Level* druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster level.
If the target's [Fortitude] saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6
points of damage + 1 point per caster level. The subject might die from
damage even if it succeeds on its saving throw.

   Fireball

   *Fireball*

   *School* evocation [fire]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area* 20-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _fireball_spell generates a searing explosion of flame that
detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per
caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area.
Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost
no pressure.

   You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height)
at which the _fireball_is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks
from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or
solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into
the _fireball_at that point. An early impact results in an early
detonation. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage,
such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged
touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates
prematurely.

   The _fireball_sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the
area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold,
copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing
barrier shatters or breaks through it, the _fireball_may continue
beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the
barrier just as any other spell effect does.

   Fire Seeds

   *Fire Seeds*

   *School* conjuration (creation) [fire]; *Level* druid 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (acorns or holly berries)

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* up to four acorns or up to eight holly berries

   *Duration* 10 min./level or until used

   *Saving Throw* none or [Reflex] half; see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   Depending on the version of _fire seeds_you choose, you turn acorns
into splash weapons that you or another character can throw, or you
turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on command.

   _Acorn Grenades_: As many as four acorns turn into special thrown
splash weapons. An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20 feet. A
ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the intended target.
Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4 points of fire damage
per caster level (maximum 20d4) divided among the acorns as you wish.
No acorn can deal more than 10d4 points of damage.

   Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In
addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to the
explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the explosion. This
explosion of fire ignites any combustible materials adjacent to the
target.

   _Holly Berry Bombs_: You turn as many as eight holly berries into
special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since they
are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed only
5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command, each
berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire damage +
1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and
igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the
area that makes a successful [Reflex] saving throw takes only half
damage.

   Fire Shield

   *Fire Shield*

   *School* evocation [fire or cold]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (phosphorus for the _warm shield;_a firefly or
glowworm for the _chill shield)_

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature
that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you from either
cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or
warm flames for your _fire shield_.

   Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals
normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of
damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This damage is either
cold damage (if you choose a _chill shield_) or fire damage (if you
choose a _warm shield_). If the attacker has [spell resistance], it
applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are
not subject to this damage if they attack you.

   When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the
flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by
one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is blue or green
if the _chill shield_is cast, violet or red if the _warm shield_is
employed. The special powers of each version are as follows.

   _Chill Shield_: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only half
damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a [Reflex]
save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

   _Warm Shield_: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only half
damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a [Reflex]
save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

   Fire Storm

   *Fire Storm*

   *School*evocation [fire]; *Level*cleric 8, druid 7

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area*two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*yes

   When a _fire storm_spell is cast, the whole area is shot through
with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm natural
vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the area that you
wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature within the area takes
1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures
that fail their [Reflex] save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire
damage each round until the flames are extinguished. Extinguishing the
flames is a full-round action that requires a DC 20 [Reflex] save.

   Fire Trap

   *Fire Trap*

   *School* abjuration [fire]; *Level* druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* object touched

   *Duration* permanent until discharged (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Fire trap_creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item
that the trap protects. A _fire trap_spell can ward any object that can
be opened and closed.

   When casting _fire trap,_you select a point on the object as the
spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery
explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's
center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster
level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by
this explosion.

   A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell
placed on it. A _[knock]_spell does not bypass a _fire trap_. An
unsuccessful _[dispel magic]_spell does not detonate the spell.
Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of
steam.

   You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can
any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast.
Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves
setting a password that you can share with friends.

   Magic traps such as _fire trap_are hard to detect and disable. A
character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a _fire
trap_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell
level (DC 27 for a druid's _fire trap_or DC 29 for the arcane version).

   Flame Arrow

   *Flame Arrow*

   *School* transmutation [fire]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of oil and a small piece of flint)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* fifty projectiles, all of which must be together at the
time of casting

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell allows you to turn ammunition (such as arrows, crossbow
bolts, shuriken, and sling stones) into fiery projectiles. Each piece
of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage to any target it
hits. A flaming projectile can easily ignite a flammable object or
structure, but it won't ignite a creature it strikes.

   Flame Blade

   *Flame Blade*

   *School* evocation [fire]; *Level* druid 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 0 ft.

   *Effect* sword-like beam

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your
hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks
with the _flame blade_are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8
points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10).
Since the blade is immaterial, your [Strength] modifier does not apply
to the damage. A _flame blade_can ignite combustible materials such as
parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

   Flame Strike

   *Flame Strike*

   *School* evocation [fire]; *Level* cleric 5, druid 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40-ft. high)

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _flame strike_evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell
deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the
damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine
power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to
fire-based attacks.

   Flaming Sphere

   *Flaming Sphere*

   *School* evocation [fire]; *Level* druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (tallow, brimstone, and powdered iron)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* 5-ft.-diameter sphere

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and
burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this
movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. If it
enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals
3d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful
[Reflex] save negates that damage. A _flaming sphere_rolls over
barriers less than 4 feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it
touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.

   The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action
for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be
extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so
does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside
unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A _flaming
sphere_winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

   Flare

   *Flare*

   *School* evocation [light]; *Level* bard 0, druid 0, sorcerer/wizard
0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* burst of light

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to
burst in front of a single creature, that creature is [dazzled] for 1
minute unless it makes a successful [Fortitude] save. Sightless
creatures, as well as creatures already [dazzled], are not affected by
_flare_.

   Flesh to Stone

   *Flesh to Stone*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (lime, water, and earth)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless,
inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or
damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has
similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does
not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells such as
_deathwatch_.

   Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

   Floating Disk

   *Floating Disk*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of mercury)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* 3-ft.-diameter disk of force

   *Duration* 1 hour/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows
you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and
1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds of weight per caster
level. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The
disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and
remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will
accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round.
If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet
between itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell
duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its range
or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath
it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting falls to the
surface beneath it.

   Fly

   *Fly*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a wing feather)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears
medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can
ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its
maneuverability is good. Using a _fly_spell requires only as much
concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells
normally. The subject of a _fly_spell can charge but not run, and it
cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it
wears. The subject gains a bonus on *note Fly: #fly. skill checks equal
to 1/2 your caster level.

   Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft,
the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round
for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it
lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6
points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell
effectively ends it, the subject also descends safely in this way if
the _fly_spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an _[antimagic
field]_.

   Fog Cloud

   *Fog Cloud*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)

   *Effect* fog spreads in 20-ft. radius

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog
obscures all sight, including [darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature
within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).
Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the
attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

   A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong
wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

   The spell does not function underwater.

   Forbiddance

   *Forbiddance*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 6

   *Casting Time* 6 rounds

   *Components* V, S, M (holy water and incense worth 1,500 gp, plus
1,500 gp per 60-foot cube), DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* 60-ft. cube/level (S)

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Forbiddance_seals an area against all planar travel into or within
it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as _[dimension
door]_and _[teleport]),_[plane shift]ing_,_astral travel, ethereal
travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail
automatically.

   In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are
different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the
warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see below).
A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes no damage
unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at which time it is
affected as normal.

   _Alignments identical_: No effect. The creature may enter the area
freely (although not by planar travel).

   _Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or
good/evil_: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful
[Will] save halves the damage, and [spell resistance] applies.

   _Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and good/evil_:
The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A successful [Will] save
halves the damage, and [spell resistance] applies.

   At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which case
creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the damage by
speaking the password as they enter the area. You must select this
option (and the password) at the time of casting. Adding a password
requires the burning of additional rare incenses worth at least 1,000
gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

   _[Dispel magic]_does not dispel a _forbiddance_effect unless the
dispeller's level is at least as high as your caster level.

   You can't have multiple overlapping _forbiddance_effects. In such a
case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.

   Forcecage

   *Forcecage*

   *School*evocation [force]; *Level*sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (ruby dust worth 500 gp)

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area*barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft. cube)

   *Duration*1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Reflex] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*no

   This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of
either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).

   Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are
too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails.
Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of
escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane,
blocking ethereal travel.

   Like a _[wall of force]_, a _forcecage_ resists _[dispel
magic],_although a _[mage's disjunction]_ still functions_._The walls
of a _forcecage_can be damaged by spells as normal, except for
_[disintegrate],_which automatically destroys it. The walls of a
_forcecage_ can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but
they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per
caster level. Contact with a _[sphere of annihilation]_or _[rod of
cancellation]_ instantly destroys a _forcecage._

   _Barred Cage_: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube
made of bands of force (similar to a _[wall of force]_spell) for bars.
The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any
creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape;
others are confined within the barred cage. You can't attack a creature
in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the
gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged
attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and
breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.

   _Windowless Cell_: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube
with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.

   Forceful Hand

   *Forceful Hand*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   This spell functions as _[interposing hand]_, except that it can
also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The _forceful hand_
gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an
attack of opportunity. Its [CMB] for bull rush checks uses your caster
level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its
[Strength] score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always
moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no
movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is
a move action. _Forceful hand_prevents the opponent from moving closer
to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the
_forceful_hand and the target closer to you. The _forceful hand_ can
instead be directed to interpose itself, as _[interposing hand]_ does.

   Foresight

   *Foresight*

   *School* divination; *Level* druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a hummingbird's feather)

   *Range* personal or touch

   *Target* see text

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none or [Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no or yes (harmless)

   This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself
or another. Once _foresight_is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings
of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never
surprised or [flat-footed]. In addition, the spell gives you a general
idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives
you a +2 insight bonus to [AC] and on [Reflex] saves. This insight
bonus is lost whenever you would lose a [Dexterity] bonus to [AC].

   When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive
warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to
the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can
be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning. Shouting a
warning, yanking a person back, and even telepathically communicating
(via an appropriate spell) can all be accomplished before some danger
befalls the subject, provided you act on the warning without delay. The
subject, however, does not gain the insight bonus to [AC] and [Reflex]
saves.

   Form of the Dragon

   *Form of the Dragon I*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (a scale of the dragon type you plan to assume)

   *Range*personal

   *Target*you

   *Duration*1 min./level (D)

   *Save*see below; *SR*no

   You become a Medium chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain a +4 size
bonus to [Strength], a +2 size bonus to [Constitution], a +4 natural
armor bonus, fly 60 feet (poor), [darkvision] 60 feet, a breath weapon,
and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite (1d8), two claws
(1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). Your breath weapon and resistance
depend on the type of dragon. You can only use the breath weapon once
per casting of this spell. All breath weapons deal 6d8 points of damage
and allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. In addition, some of the
dragon types grant additional abilities, as noted below.

   _Black dragon_: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, swim 60 feet

   _Blue dragon_: 60-foot line of electricity, resist electricity 20,
burrow 20 feet

   _Green dragon_: 30-foot cone of acid, resist acid 20, swim 40 feet

   _Red dragon_: 30-foot cone of fire, resist fire 30, vulnerability to
cold

   _White dragon_: 30-foot cone of cold, resist cold 20, swim 60 feet,
vulnerability to fire

   *Form of the Dragon II*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 7

   This spell functions as _[form of the dragon I]_except that it also
allows you to assume the form of a Large chromatic or metallic dragon.
You gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to [Strength], a +4
size bonus to [Constitution], a +6 natural armor bonus, fly 90 feet
(poor), [darkvision] 60 feet, a breath weapon, [DR] 5/magic, and
resistance to one element. You also gain one bite (2d6), two claws
(1d8), two wing attacks (1d6), and one tail slap attack (1d8). You can
only use the breath weapon twice per casting of this spell, and you
must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 8d8 points
of damage and allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. Line breath
weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to 40-foot cones.

   *Form of the Dragon III*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 8

   This spell functions as _[form of the dragon II]_save that it also
allows you to take the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You
gain the following abilities: a +10 size bonus to [Strength], a +8 size
bonus to [Constitution], a +8 natural armor bonus, fly 120 feet (poor),
[blindsense] 60 feet, [darkvision] 120 feet, a breath weapon, [DR]
10/magic, frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and
immunity to one element (of the same type _[form of the dragon
I]_grants resistance to). You also gain one bite (2d8), two claws
(2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one tail slap attack (2d6). You can
use the breath weapon as often as you like, but you must wait 1d4
rounds between uses. All breath weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and
allow a [Reflex] save for half damage. Line breath weapons increase to
100-foot lines and cones increase to 50-foot cones.

   Fox's Cunning

   *Fox's Cunning*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (hairs or dung from a fox)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus
to [Intelligence], adding the usual benefits to [Intelligence]-based
skill checks and other uses of the [Intelligence] modifier. Wizards
(and other spellcasters who rely on [Intelligence]) affected by this
spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased
[Intelligence], but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this
spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks.

   *Fox's Cunning, Mass*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

   This spell functions like _[fox's cunning]_, except that it affects
multiple creatures.

   Freedom

   *Freedom*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) or see text

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict movement,
including _[binding]_, _[entangle]_, grappling, _[imprisonment]_,
_[maze]_, paralysis, petrification, pinning, _[sleep]_, _[slow]_,
stunning, _[temporal stasis]_, and _[web]_. To free a creature from
_[imprisonment]_or _[maze],_you must know its name and background, and
you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or banished
into the _[maze]_.

   Freedom of Movement

   *Freedom of Movement*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4, ranger 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a leather strip bound to the target), DF

   *Range* personal or touch

   *Target* you or creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack
normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of
magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, _[solid fog]_,
_[slow]_, and _[web]_. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the
target automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any
combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a
grapple or a pin.

   The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while
underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with
bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that
the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The _freedom of
movement_spell does not, however, grant [water breathing].

   Freezing Sphere

   *Freezing Sphere*

   *School* evocation [cold]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a small crystal sphere)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Target, Effect, or Area* see text

   *Duration* instantaneous or 1 round/level; see text

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Freezing sphere_creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks
from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a
40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster
level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the
water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level
(maximum 15d8) and is [staggered] for 1d4 rounds.

   If the _freezing sphere_strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the
liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius. This ice lasts for 1
round per caster level. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of
a targeted body of water become trapped in the ice. Attempting to break
free is a full-round action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25
[Strength] check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to do so.

   You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if
you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are holding the
charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1 round per level, at
the end of which time the _freezing sphere_bursts centered on you (and
you receive no saving throw to resist its effect). Firing the globe in
a later round is a standard action.

   *Rage*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Targets* one willing living creature per three levels, no two of
which may be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* concentration + 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to [Strength] and
[Constitution], a +1 morale bonus on [Will] saves, and a -2 penalty to
[AC]. The effect is otherwise identical with a barbarian's rage except
that the subjects aren't [fatigued] at the end of the rage.

   Rainbow Pattern

   *Rainbow Pattern*

   *School* illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V (bard only), S, M (a piece of phosphor), F (a crystal
prism); see text

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* Concentration +1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates
those within it. _Rainbow pattern_fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of
creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is
[fascinated] by the pattern.

   With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the _rainbow
pattern_ move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of
origin). All [fascinated] creatures follow the moving rainbow of light,
trying to remain within the effect. [Fascinated] creatures who are
restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the
pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each [fascinated]
creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely
blocked, creatures who can't see them are no longer affected.

   The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

   Raise Dead

   *Raise Dead*

   *School*conjuration (healing); *Level*cleric 5

   *Casting Time*1 minute

   *Components*V, S, M (diamond worth 5,000 gp), DF

   *Range*touch

   *Target*dead creature touched

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*none, see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*yes (harmless)

   You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature
that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level. In
addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the
subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work;
therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

   Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell
gains two permanent [negative levels] when it is raised, just as if it
had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st
level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would
reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be raised). A character who
died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell
upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells
(such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell
slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

   A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current
HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and
normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but
magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes
mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the
creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead
creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this
spell.

   A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by
a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals,
outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring
back a creature that has died of old age.

   Ray of Enfeeblement

   *Ray of Enfeeblement*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* ray

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a
ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to
[Strength] equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The
subject's [Strength] score cannot drop below 1. A successful
[Fortitude] save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not
stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

   Ray of Exhaustion

   *Ray of Exhaustion*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* ray

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial; see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on
a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

   The subject is immediately [exhausted] for the spell's duration. A
successful [Fortitude] save means the creature is only [fatigued].

   A character that is already [fatigued] instead becomes [exhausted].

   This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [exhausted].
Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the
spell's duration expires.

   Ray of Frost

   *Ray of Frost*

   *School* evocation [cold]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* ray

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage
to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

   Read Magic

   *Read Magic*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1,
ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects--books, scrolls,
weapons, and the like--that would otherwise be unintelligible. This
deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the
writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped
scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the
magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular
writing without recourse to the use of _read magic._You can read at the
rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to
identify a _[glyph of warding]_with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a
_greater glyph of warding_with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any
_symbol_spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

   _Read magic_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   Reduce Animal

   *Reduce Animal*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 2, ranger 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one willing animal of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge size

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell functions like _[reduce person],_except that it affects a
single willing animal. Reduce the damage dealt by the animal's natural
attacks as appropriate for its new size (see [Equipment] how to adjust
damage for size).

   Reduce Person

   *Reduce Person*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one humanoid creature

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving
its height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This
decrease changes the creature's size category to the next smaller one.
The target gains a +2 size bonus to [Dexterity], a -2 size penalty to
[Strength] (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls and [AC]
due to its reduced size.

   A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space
of 2-1/2 feet and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter
an opponent's square to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size
decreases to Medium has a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5
feet. This spell doesn't change the target's speed.

   All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by
the spell.

   Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical
properties are not affected by this spell. Any _reduced_item that
leaves the _reduced_creature's possession (including a projectile or
thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that
thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based
on the size of the weapon that fired them).

   Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack. _Reduce
person_counters and dispels _[enlarge person]_.

   _Reduce person_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   *Reduce Person, Mass*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Target* one humanoid creature/level, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[reduce person]_, except that it affects
multiple creatures.

   Refuge

   *Refuge*

   *School* conjuration (teleportation); *Level* cleric 7,
sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a prepared object worth 1,500 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* object touched

   *Duration* permanent until discharged

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   When you cast this spell, you create powerful magic in a specially
prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport
its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode.
Once the item is so enhanced, you must give it willingly to a creature
and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the
item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command
word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard
action). When this is done, the individual and all objects it is
wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the character's heavy load) are
instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected
(aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the
subject).

   You can alter the spell when casting it so that it transports you to
within 10 feet of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the
command word spoken. You will have a general idea of the location and
situation of the item possessor at the time the _refuge_spell is
discharged, but once you decide to alter the spell in this fashion, you
have no choice whether or not to be transported.

   Regenerate

   *Regenerate*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 7, druid 9

   *Casting Time* 3 full rounds

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The subject's severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet,
arms, legs, tails, or even heads of multiheaded creatures), broken
bones, and ruined organs grow back. After the spell is cast, the
physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed members are
present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds otherwise.

   _Regenerate_also cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster
level (maximum +35), rids the subject of exhaustion and fatigue, and
eliminates all nonlethal damage the subject has taken. It has no effect
on nonliving creatures (including undead).

   Reincarnate

   *Reincarnate*

   *School*transmutation; *Level*druid 4

   *Casting Time*10 minutes

   *Components*V, S, M, DF (oils worth 1,000 gp)

   *Range*touch

   *Target*dead creature touched

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*none, see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*yes (harmless)

   With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body,
provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting
of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If
the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work;
therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.

   Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical
ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not
a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still
exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell
must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The
magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the
soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1
hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.

   A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and
form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly
possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit
points are unchanged. [Strength], [Dexterity], and [Constitution]
scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's
racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous
race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining
ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent [negative
levels] when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes
2 points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its
[Con] to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died
with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon
being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells
(such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell
slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.

   It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make
it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is
the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.

   For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the
table below. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of
the same type should be created.

   A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by
a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs,
elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The
spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.

100     Other (GM's choice)   ?                   ?    ?

   The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its
new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor,
natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't
automatically speak the language of the new form.

   A _[wish]_or a _[miracle]_spell can restore a reincarnated character
to his or her original form.

   Remove Blindness/Deafness

   *Remove Blindness/Deafness*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 3, paladin 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   _Remove blindness/deafness_cures blindness or deafness (your
choice), whether the effect is normal or magical in nature. The spell
does not restore ears or eyes that have been lost, but it repairs them
if they are damaged.

   _Remove blindness/deafness_ counters and dispels
_[blindness/deafness]_.

   Remove Curse

   *Remove Curse*

   *School*abjuration; *Level*bard 3, cleric 3, paladin 3,

   *Range*touch

   *Target*creature or object touched

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*yes (harmless)

   _Remove curse_can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If
the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 +
caster level) against the DC of each curse affecting the target.
Success means that the curse is removed. _Remove curse_does not remove
the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although a
successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any
such cursed item to remove and get rid of it.

   _Remove curse_ counters and dispels _[bestow curse]_.

   Remove Disease

   *Remove Disease*

   *School*conjuration (healing); *Level*cleric 3, druid 3, ranger 3

   *Range*touch

   *Target*creature touched

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Fortitude] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.*yes (harmless)

   _Remove disease_can cure all diseases from which the subject is
suffering. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
against the DC of each disease affecting the target. Success means that
the disease is cured. The spell also kills some hazards and parasites,
including green slime and others.

   Since the spell's duration is instantaneous, it does not prevent

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus
against fear effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the
influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is
suppressed for the duration of the spell.

   _Remove fear_ counters and dispels _cause fear_.

   Remove Paralysis

   *Remove Paralysis*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 2, paladin 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* up to four creatures, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   You can free one or more creatures from the effects of temporary
paralysis or related magic, including spells and effects that cause a
creature to gain the [staggered] condition. If the spell is cast on one
creature, the paralysis is negated. If cast on two creatures, each
receives another save with a +4 resistance bonus against the effect
that afflicts it. If cast on three or four creatures, each receives
another save with a +2 resistance bonus.

   The spell does not restore ability scores reduced by penalties,
damage, or drain.

   Repel Metal or Stone

   *Repel Metal or Stone*

   *School* abjuration [earth]; *Level* druid 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 60 ft.

   *Area* 60-ft. line from you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell creates waves of invisible energy that roll forth from
you. All metal or stone objects in the path of the spell are pushed
away from you to the limit of the range. Fixed metal or stone objects
larger than 3 inches in diameter and loose objects weighing more than
500 pounds are not affected. Anything else, including animated objects,
small boulders, and creatures in metal armor, moves back. Fixed objects
3 inches in diameter or smaller bend or break, and the pieces move with
the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at the
rate of 40 feet per round.

   Objects such as metal armor, swords, and the like are pushed back,
dragging their bearers with them. Even magic items with metal
components are repelled, although an _[antimagic field]_blocks the
effects. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let go.
A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action and
drop it as a free action.

   The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the
spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you
can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's
power.

   Repel Vermin

   *Repel Vermin*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4, ranger 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 10 ft.

   *Area* 10-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none or [Will] negates; see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   An invisible barrier holds back vermin. A vermin with HD of less
than one-third your level cannot penetrate the barrier.

   A vermin with HD of one-third your level or more can penetrate the
barrier if it succeeds on a [Will] save. Even so, crossing the barrier
deals the vermin 2d6 points of damage, and pressing against the barrier
causes pain, which deters most vermin.

   Repel Wood

   *Repel Wood*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 60 ft.

   *Area* 60-ft. line-shaped emanation from you

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   Waves of energy roll forth from you, moving in the direction that
you determine, causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to
be pushed away from you to the limit of the range. Wooden objects
larger than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not
affected, but loose objects are. Objects 3 inches in diameter or
smaller that are fixed in place splinter and break, and the pieces move
with the wave of energy. Objects affected by the spell are repelled at
the rate of 40 feet per round.

   Objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and
hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying
them along. A creature being dragged by an item it is carrying can let
go. A creature being dragged by a shield can loose it as a move action
and drop it as a free action. If a spear is planted (set) in a way that
prevents this forced movement, it splinters. Even magic items with
wooden sections are repelled, although an _[antimagic field]_blocks the
effects.

   The waves of energy continue to sweep down the set path for the
spell's duration. After you cast the spell, the path is set, and you
can then do other things or go elsewhere without affecting the spell's
power.

   Repulsion

   *Repulsion*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a pair of canine statuettes worth 50 gp)

   *Range* up to 10 ft./level

   *Area* up to 10-ft.-radius/level emanation centered on you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   An invisible, mobile field surrounds you and prevents creatures from
approaching you. You decide how big the field is at the time of casting
(to the limit your level allows). Any creature within or entering the
field must attempt a save. If it fails, it becomes unable to move
toward you for the duration of the spell. Repelled creatures' actions
are not otherwise restricted. They can fight other creatures and can
cast spells and attack you with ranged weapons. If you move closer to
an affected creature, nothing happens. The creature is not forced back.
The creature is free to make melee attacks against you if you come
within reach. If a repelled creature moves away from you and then tries
to turn back toward you, it cannot move any closer if it is still
within the spell's area.

   Resilient Sphere

   *Resilient Sphere*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a crystal sphere)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* 1-ft.-diameter/level sphere, centered around a creature

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the
creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The
sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere
functions as a _[wall of force]_, except that it can be negated by
_[dispel magic]_. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The
sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the
struggles of those within.

   Resistance

   *Resistance*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, paladin 1,
sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a miniature cloak)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 minute

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from
harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves.

   _Resistance_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   Resist Energy

   *Resist Energy*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 1,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of
whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy
type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such
damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is
reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points.
The value of the [energy resistance] granted increases to 20 points at
7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell
protects the recipient's equipment as well.

   _Resist energy_absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer
unfortunate side effects.

   _Resist energy_overlaps (and does not stack with) _[protection from
energy]._If a character is warded by _[protection from energy]_and
_resist energy,_the _protection_spell absorbs damage until its power is
[exhausted].

   Restoration

   *Restoration*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 4, paladin 4

   *Casting Time* 1 minute

   *Components* V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp or 1,000 gp, see
text)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell functions like _[lesser restoration],_ except that it
also dispels temporary [negative levels] or one permanent negative
level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative level, it
has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp. This spell
cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent [negative
level]possessed by a target in a 1-week period.

   _Restoration_ cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores
all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice
if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or
exhaustion suffered by the target.

   *Restoration, Greater*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 7

   *Components* V, S, M (diamond dust 5,000 gp)

   This spell functions like _[lesser restoration],_ except that it
dispels all permanent and temporary [negative levels] afflicting the
healed creature. _Greater restoration_ also dispels all magical effects
penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability
damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability
scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all
forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects.

   *Restoration, Lesser*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 1

   *Casting Time* 3 rounds

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   _Lesser restoration_dispels any magical effects reducing one of the
subject's ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability
damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any
fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an [exhausted]
condition to [fatigued]. It does not restore permanent ability drain.

   Resurrection

   *Resurrection*

   *School*conjuration (healing); *Level*cleric 7

   *Components*V, S, M (diamond worth 10,000 gp), DF

   This spell functions like _[raise dead],_except that you are able to
restore life and complete strength to any deceased creature.

   The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small
portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but
the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's
body at the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a
_[disintegrate]_spell count as a small portion of its body.) The
creature can have been dead no longer than 10 years per caster level.

   Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately restored
to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of prepared spells.
The subject of the spell gains one permanent [negative level]when it is
raised, just as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If
the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of [Constitution] drain
instead (if this would reduce its [Con] to 0 or less, it can't be
resurrected).

   You can resurrect someone killed by a death effect or someone who
has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You cannot
resurrect someone who has died of old age. Constructs, elementals,
outsiders, and undead creatures can't be resurrected.

   Reverse Gravity

   *Reverse Gravity*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (lodestone and iron filings)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell reverses gravity in an area, causing unattached objects
and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the area
in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in
this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner
as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature
reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains
there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the
spell duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

   Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the
area can attempt a [Reflex] save to secure itself when the spell
strikes. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from
falling.

   Righteous Might

   *Righteous Might*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   Your height immediately doubles, and your weight increases by a
factor of eight. This increase changes your size category to the next
larger one. You gain a +4 size bonus to [Strength] and [Constitution]
and take a -2 penalty to your [Dexterity]. You gain a +2 enhancement
bonus to your natural armor. You gain [DR] 5/evil (if you normally
channel positive energy) or [DR] 5/good (if you normally channel
negative energy). At 15th level, this [DR] becomes 10/evil or 10/good
(the maximum). Your size modifier for [AC] and attacks changes as
appropriate to your new size category. This spell doesn't change your
speed. Determine space and reach as appropriate to your new size.

   If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain
the maximum possible size and may make a [Strength] check (using your
increased [Strength]) to burst any enclosures in the process (see
[Additional Rules] for rules on breaking objects). If you fail, you are
constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you--the spell
cannot crush you by increasing your size.

   All equipment you wear or carry is similarly enlarged by the spell.
Melee weapons deal more damage. Other magical properties are not
affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves your possession
(including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its
normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their
normal damage. Magical effects that increase size do not stack.

   Rope Trick

   *Rope Trick*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (powdered corn and a twisted loop of parchment)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one touched piece of rope from 5 ft. to 30 ft. long

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long,
one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs
perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper
end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside
the usual multiverse of extradimensional spaces. Creatures in the
extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells
(including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The
space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). The rope cannot
be removed or hidden. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A
weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

   Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can
area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out
of it as if a 3-foot-by-5-foot window were centered on the rope. The
window is [invisible], and even creatures that can see the window can't
see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out
when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a
time. The _rope trick_spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if
they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

   Rusting Grasp

   *Rusting Grasp*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one nonmagical ferrous object (or the volume of the object
within 3 ft. of the touched point) or one ferrous creature

   *Duration* see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   Any iron or iron alloy item you touch crumbles into rust. If the
item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-foot radius, a
3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and destroyed. Magic items
made of metal are immune to this spell.

   You may employ _rusting grasp_in combat with a successful melee
touch attack. _Rusting grasp_used in this way instantaneously destroys
1d6 points of [AC] gained from metal armor (to the maximum amount of
protection the armor offers) through corrosion.

   Weapons in use by an opponent targeted by the spell are more
difficult to grasp. You must succeed on a melee touch attack against
the weapon. A metal weapon that is hit is destroyed. Striking at an
opponent's weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. Also, you must
touch the weapon and not the other way around.

   Against a ferrous creature, _rusting grasp_instantaneously deals 3d6
points of damage + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) per successful
attack. The spell lasts for 1 round per level, and you can make one
melee touch attack per round.

13.1 Character Advancement
==========================

As player characters overcome challenges, they gain experience points.
As these points accumulate, PCs advance in level and power. The rate of
this advancement depends on the type of game that your group wants to
play. Some prefer a fast-paced game, where characters gain levels every
few sessions, while others prefer a game where advancement occurs less
frequently. In the end, it is up to your group to decide what rate fits
you best. Characters advance in level according to Table: Character
Advancement and Level-Dependent Bonuses.

File: test.info,  Node: Advancing Your Character,  Next: Multiclassing,  Up: Character Advancement

13.1.1 Advancing Your Character
-------------------------------

A character advances in level as soon as he earns enough experience
points to do so--typically, this occurs at the end of a game session,
when your GM hands out that session's experience point awards.

   The process of advancing a character works in much the same way as
generating a character, except that your ability scores, race, and
previous choices concerning class, skills, and feats cannot be changed.
Adding a level generally gives you new abilities, additional skill
points to spend, more hit points, and possibly an ability score
increase or additional feat (see Table: Character Advancement and
Level-Dependent Bonuses). Over time, as your character rises to higher
levels, he becomes a truly powerful force in the game world, capable of
ruling nations or bringing them to their knees.

   When adding new levels of an existing class or adding levels of a
new class (see Multiclassing, below), make sure to take the following
steps in order. First, select your new class level. You must be able to
qualify for this level before any of the following adjustments are
made. Second, apply any ability score increases due to gaining a level.
Third, integrate all of the level's class abilities and then roll for
additional hit points. Finally, add new skills and feats. For more
information on when you gain new feats and ability score increases, see
Table: Character Advancement and Level-Dependent Bonuses.

13.1.2 Multiclassing
--------------------

Instead of gaining the abilities granted by the next level in your
character's current class, he can instead gain the 1st-level abilities
of a new class, adding all of those abilities to his existing ones.
This is known as “multiclassing.”

   For example, let's say a 5th-level fighter decides to dabble in the
arcane arts, and adds one level of wizard when he advances to 6th
level. Such a character would have the powers and abilities of both a
5th-level fighter and a 1st-level wizard, but would still be considered
a 6th-level character. (His class levels would be 5th and 1st, but his
total character level is 6th.) He keeps all of his bonus feats gained
from 5 levels of fighter, but can now also cast 1st-level spells and
picks an arcane school. He adds all of the hit points, base attack
bonuses, and saving throw bonuses from a 1st-level wizard on top of
those gained from being a 5th-level fighter.

   Note that there are a number of effects and prerequisites that rely
on a character's level or Hit Dice. Such effects are always based on
the total number of levels or Hit Dice a character possesses, not just
those from one class. The exception to this is class abilities, most of
which are based on the total number of class levels that a character
possesses of that particular class.

13.1.3 Favored Class
--------------------

Each character begins play with a single favored class of his
choosing--typically, this is the same class as the one he chooses at
1st level. Whenever a character gains a level in his favored class, he
receives either + 1 hit point or + 1 skill rank. The choice of favored
class cannot be changed once the character is created, and the choice
of gaining a hit point or a skill rank each time a character gains a
level (including his first level) cannot be changed once made for a
particular level. Prestige classes ) can never be a favored class.

   *Area* 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   By casting _zone of silence_, you manipulate sound waves in your
immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area can
converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or any other
noises from within, including language-dependent or sonic spell
effects. This effect is centered on you and moves with you. Anyone who
enters the zone immediately becomes subject to its effects, but those
who leave are no longer affected. Note, however, that a successful DC
20 Linguistics check to read lips can still reveal what's said inside a
_zone of silence._

   Zone of Truth

   *Zone of Truth*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric
2, paladin 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area* 20-ft.-radius emanation

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't
speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected
creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast
or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected
creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid
answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or
they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the
truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.

   *Gaseous Form*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* S, M/DF (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)

   *Range* touch

   *Target*willing corporeal creature touched

   *Duration* 2 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and
translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes
worthless, though its size, [Dexterity], deflection bonuses, and armor
bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains [DR] 10/magic
and becomes immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits. It
can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus
components while in gaseous form. This does not rule out the use of
certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats
Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials. The subject also loses
supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch spell
ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the _gaseous
form_spell takes effect.

   A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet
and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through
small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was
wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The
creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or
other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even
those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items
remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

   Gate

   *Gate*

   *School* conjuration (creation or calling); *Level* cleric 9,
sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (see text)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* see text

   *Duration* instantaneous or concentration (up to 1 round/level); see
text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   Casting a _gate_spell has two effects. First, it creates an
interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane
you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either
direction.

   Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being
through the _gate._

   The _gate_itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in
diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it
comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a
two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when
casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted
instantly to the other side.

   A _gate_has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the
_gate_from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures
moving through it from the back are not.

   _Planar Travel_: As a mode of planar travel, a _gate_spell functions
much like a _[plane shift]_spell, except that the _gate_opens precisely
at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings
who rule a planar realm can prevent a _gate_from opening in their
presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not
join hands with you--anyone who chooses to step through the portal is
transported. A _gate_cannot be opened to another point on the same
plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.

   You may hold the _gate_open only for a brief time (no more than 1
round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else
the interplanar connection is severed.

   _Calling Creatures_: The second effect of the _gate_spell is to call
an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a
particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the
_gate_to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and
pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique
beings are under no compulsion to come through the _gate,_although they
may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates
a _gate_that remains open just long enough to transport the called
creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in
rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that
must be paid to the called creatures.

   If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known
individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures.
In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level.
In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not
exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster
level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be
controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases,
making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled
being may return to its home plane at any time.

   If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service
from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for
that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to
the promised favor or reward; see the _[lesser planar ally]_spell for
appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in
“livestock” rather than in coin, which could involve complications.
Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to
your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised
reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return
to its own plane.

   Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being
subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the
very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.

   _Note_: When you use a calling spell such as _gate_to call an air,
chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes
a spell of that type.

   Geas/Quest

   *Geas, Lesser*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature with 7 HD or less

   *Duration* 1 day/level or until discharged (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _lesser geas_places a magical command on a creature to carry out
some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as
desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to
understand you. While a _geas_cannot compel a creature to kill itself
or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost
any other course of activity.

   The _geased_creature must follow the given instructions until the
_geas_is completed, no matter how long it takes.

   If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient
cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect
for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert
some instructions.

   If the subject is prevented from obeying the _lesser geas_for 24
hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day,
another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score
can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score
penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the
_lesser geas._

   A _lesser geas_(and all ability score penalties) can be ended by
_[break enchantment]_, _[limited wish]_, _[remove curse]_, _[miracle]_,
or _[wish]_. _[Dispel magic]_does not affect a _lesser geas_.

   *Geas/Quest*

   *School*enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level*bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time*10 minutes

   *Target*one living creature

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*yes

   This spell functions similarly to _lesser geas,_except that it
affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

   If the subject is prevented from obeying the _geas/quest_for 24
hours, it takes a -3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day,
another -3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -12. No ability score
can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score
penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the
_geas/quest._

   A _[remove curse]_spell ends a _geas/quest_spell only if its caster
level is at least two higher than your caster level. _[Break
enchantment]_does not end a _geas/quest_, but _[limited wish]_,
_[miracle]_, and _[wish]_do.

   Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as
_geas,_while clerics call the same spell _quest_.

   Gentle Repose

   *Gentle Repose*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (salt and a copper piece for each of the
corpse's eyes)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* corpse touched

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   You preserve the remains of a dead creature so that they do not
decay. Doing so effectively extends the time limit on raising that
creature from the dead (see _[raise dead]_). Days spent under the
influence of this spell don't count against the time limit.
Additionally, this spell makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying)
comrade less unpleasant.

   The spell also works on severed body parts and the like.

   Ghost Sound

   *Ghost Sound*

   *School* illusion (figment); *Level* bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a bit of wool or a small lump of wax)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* illusory sounds

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] disbelief; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   _Ghost sound_allows you to create a volume of sound that rises,
recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type
of sound _ghost sound_creates when casting it and cannot thereafter
change the sound's basic character.

   The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce
as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40
humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or
running sounds can be created. The noise a _ghost sound_spell produces
can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of
rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16
humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.
Anyone who hears a _ghost sound_ receives a [Will] save to disbelieve.

   _Ghost sound_can enhance the effectiveness of a _[silent
image]_spell.

   _Ghost sound_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   Ghoul touch

   *Ghoul touch*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (cloth from a ghoul or earth from a ghoul's
lair)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living humanoid touched

   *Duration* 1d6+2 rounds

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze
a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a
successful melee touch attack.

   A [paralyzed] subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living
creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become [sickened]
([Fortitude] negates). A _[neutralize poison]_spell removes the effect
from a [sickened] creature, and creatures immune to poison are
unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.

   Giant Form

   *Giant Form I*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to
assume)

   *Range*personal

   *Target*you

   *Duration*1 min./level (D)

   When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Large
humanoid creature of the giant subtype. Once you assume your new form,
you gain the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to [Strength], a -2
penalty to [Dexterity], a +4 size bonus to [Constitution], a +4 natural
armor bonus, and [low-light vision]. If the form you assume has any of
the following abilities, you gain the listed ability: [darkvision] 60
feet, rend (2d6 damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock
throwing (range 60 feet, 2d6 damage). If the creature has immunity or
resistance to any elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements.
If the creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that
vulnerability.

   *Giant Form II*

   *School*Transmutation (polymorph); *Level*sorcerer/wizard 8

   This spell functions as _[giant form I]_except that it also allows
you to assume the form of any Huge creature of the giant type. You gain
the following abilities: a +8 size bonus to [Strength], a -2 penalty to
[Dexterity], a +6 size bonus to [Constitution], a +6 natural armor
bonus, [low-light vision], and a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your
speed. If the form you assume has any of the following abilities, you
gain the listed ability: swim 60 feet, [darkvision] 60 feet, rend (2d8
damage), regeneration 5, rock catching, and rock throwing (range 120
feet, 2d10 damage). If the creature has immunity or resistance to one
element, you gain that immunity or resistance. If the creature has
vulnerability to an element, you gain that vulnerability.

   Giant Vermin

   *Giant Vermin*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 4, druid 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* 1 or more vermin, no two of which can be more than 30 ft.
apart

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   You turn a number of normal-sized centipedes, scorpions, or spiders
into their giant counterparts. Only one type of vermin can be
transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a
spider). The number of vermin which can be affected by this spell
depends on your caster level, as noted on the table below.

   Giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to harm you, but
your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“Attack,”
“Defend,” “Stop,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature
when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too
complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise,
the giant vermin attack whomever or whatever is near them.

Caster Level     Centipedes   Scorpions   Spiders
---------------------------------------------------- 
9th or lower     3            1           2
10th-13th        4            2           3
14th-17th        6            3           4
18th-19th        8            4           5
20th or higher   12           6           8

   Glibness

   *Glibness*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   Your speech becomes fluent and more believable, causing those who
hear you to believe every word you say. You gain a +20 bonus on Bluff
checks made to convince another of the truth of your words. This bonus
doesn't apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as feinting in
combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a hidden message
via innuendo.

   If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies
or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on
a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your
caster level to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your
lies or force you to speak only the truth.

   Glitterdust

   *Glitterdust*

   *School*conjuration (creation); *Level*bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (ground mica)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area*creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration*1 round/level

   *Save*[Will] negates (blinding only); *SR*no

   A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the
area, causing creatures to become [blinded] and visibly outlining
[invisible] things for the duration of the spell. All within the area
are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to
sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn [blinded]
creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.

   Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Stealth
checks.

   Globe of Invulnerability

   *Globe of Invulnerability*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   This spell functions like _[lesser globe of invulnerability],_except
that it also excludes 4th-level spells and spell-like effects.

   *Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead)

   *Range* 10 ft.

   *Area* 10-ft.-radius spherical emanation, centered on you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and
excludes all spell effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of
any such spells does not include the area of the _[lesser globe of
invulnerability]_. Such spells fail to affect any target located within
the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities and spells or
spell-like effects from items. Any type of spell, however, can be cast
through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are
not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the
globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a _[dispel
magic]_spell_._You can leave and return to the globe without penalty.

   Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter
the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled.

   If a given spell has more than one level depending on which
character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster
to determine whether _[lesser globe of invulnerability]_stops it.

   Glyph of Warding

   *Glyph of Warding*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target or Area* object touched or up to 5 sq. ft./level

   *Duration* permanent until discharged (D)

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no (object) and yes; see text

   This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the
warded area or object. A _glyph of warding_can guard a bridge or
passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.

   You set all of the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature
entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking
a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the
magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger,
glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height
or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set
with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your
religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs
respond to [invisible] creatures normally but are not triggered by
those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast
on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers,
each can be separately warded.

   When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines
around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape
up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is
completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.

   Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or
magical probing, though they can be dispelled. _[Mislead]_,
_[polymorph]_, and _[nondetection]_(and similar magical effects) can
fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. _[Read
magic]_allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_with a DC 13
Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it
and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of
damage caused, what spell is stored).

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _glyph of warding_are hard to detect and
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find the glyph
and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell
level, or 28 for _glyph of warding_.

   Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the
intruder or activates a spell.

   _Blast Glyph_: A _blast glyph_deals 1d8 points of damage per two
caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of
him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic
(caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can
attempt a [Reflex] save to take half damage. [Spell resistance] applies
against this effect.

   _Spell Glyph_: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower
that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on
your caster level at the time of casting the glyph_._If the spell has a
target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an
amorphous effect, the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If
the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the
intruder and attack. Saving throws and [spell resistance] operate as
normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in
the glyph.

   *Glyph of Warding, Greater*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 6

   This spell functions like _[glyph of warding],_except that a
_greater blast glyph_deals up to 10d8 points of damage, and a _greater
spell glyph_can store a spell of 6th level or lower.

   _[Read magic]_ allows you to identify a _greater glyph of warding_
with a DC 16 Spellcraft check.

   _Material Component_: You trace the glyph with incense, which must
first be sprinkled with powdered diamond worth at least 400 gp.

   Goodberry

   *Goodberry*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* 2d4 fresh berries touched

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   Casting _goodberry_makes 2d4 freshly picked berries magical. You (as
well as any other druid of 3rd or higher level) can immediately discern
which berries are affected. Each transmuted berry provides nourishment
as if it were a normal meal for a Medium creature. The berry also cures
1 point of damage when eaten, subject to a maximum of 8 points of such
curing in any 24-hour period.

   Good Hope

   *Good Hope*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Targets* one living creature/level, no two of which may be more
than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell instills powerful hope in the subjects. Each affected
creature gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls,
ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

   _Good hope_ counters and dispels _[crushing despair]._

   Grasping Hand

   *Grasping Hand*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   This spell functions as _[interposing hand]_, except that it can
also grapple one opponent you select. The _grasping hand_ gets one
grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. Its [CMB] and [CMD] for grapple checks use your caster
level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its
[Strength] (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its [Dexterity]
is 10, granting no bonus on the [Combat Maneuver Defense]). The hand
holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell
to a new target is a move action. The _grasping hand_ can instead be
directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above,
or it can be directed to interpose itself, as _[interposing hand]_ does.

   Grease

   *Grease*

   *School*conjuration (creation); *Level*bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M (butter)

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target*one object or 10-ft. square

   *Duration*1 min./level (D)

   *Save*see text; *SR*no

   A _grease_spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery
grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a
successful [Reflex] save or fall. A creature can walk within or through
the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.
Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a [Reflex]
save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the
Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn
do not need to make this check and are not considered [flat-footed].

   The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item.
Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an
object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a
[Reflex] saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw
fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be
made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the
_greased_item. A creature wearing _greased_armor or clothing gains a
+10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver
checks made to escape a grapple, and to their [CMD] to avoid being
[grappled].

   Greater (Spell Name)

   *Greater (Spell Name)*

   Any spell whose name begins with _greater_is alphabetized according
to the spell name. Thus, the description of a _greater_spell appears
near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains
that have _greater_spells in them include those based on the spells
_[arcane sight], [command], [dispel magic], [glyph of warding],
[invisibility], [magic fang], [magic weapon], [planar ally], [planar
binding], [polymorph], [prying eyes], [restoration], [scrying], [shadow
conjuration], [shadow evocation], [shout],_and _[teleport]._

   Guards and Wards

   *Guards and Wards*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 30 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone
and oil, a knotted string, and a small amount of blood), F (a small
silver rod)

   *Range* anywhere within the area to be warded

   This powerful spell is primarily used to defend a stronghold or
fortress by creating a number of magical wards and effects. The ward
protects 200 square feet per caster level. The warded area can be as
much as 20 feet high, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several
stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them; you must be
somewhere within the area to be warded to cast the spell. The spell
creates the following magical effects within the warded area.

   _Fog_: Fog fills all corridors, obscuring all sight, including
[darkvision], beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment
(attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total
concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to
locate the target). Saving Throw: none. *note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: no.

   _Arcane Locks_: All doors in the warded area are _[arcane
lock]ed._Saving Throw: none. *note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: no.

   _Webs_: Webs fill all stairs from top to bottom. These strands are
identical with those created by the _[web]_spell, except that they
regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while the _guards
and wards_spell lasts. Saving Throw: [Reflex] negates; see text for
_[web]_. *note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.: no.

   _Confusion_: Where there are choices in direction--such as a
corridor intersection or side passage--a minor _confusion-_type effect
functions so as to make it 50% probable that intruders believe they are
going in the opposite direction from the one they actually chose. This
is a mind-affecting effect. Saving Throw: none. *note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: yes.

   _Lost Doors_: One door per caster level is covered by a _[silent
image]_to appear as if it were a plain wall. Saving Throw: [Will]
disbelief (if interacted with). *note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: no.

   In addition, you can place your choice of one of the following five
magical effects.

   ​1. _[Dancing lights]_in four corridors. You can designate a simple
program that causes the lights to repeat as long as the _guards and
wards_spell lasts. Saving Throw: none. *note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: no.

   ​2. A _[magic mouth]_in two places. Saving Throw: none. *note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.: no.

   ​3. A _[stinking cloud]_in two places. The vapors appear in the
places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by
wind while the _guards and wards_spell lasts. Saving Throw: [Fortitude]
negates; see text for _[stinking cloud]._*note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.: no.

   ​4. A _[gust of wind]_in one corridor or room. Saving Throw:
[Fortitude] negates. *note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.: yes.

   ​5. A _[suggestion]_in one place. You select an area of up to 5 feet
square, and any creature who enters or passes through the area receives
the _[suggestion]_mentally. Saving Throw: [Will] negates. *note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.: yes.

   The whole warded area radiates strong magic of the abjuration
school. A _[dispel magic]_cast on a specific effect, if successful,
removes only that effect. A successful _[mage's disjunction]_destroys
the entire _guards and wards_effect.

the extreme of the range

   *Duration* 1 round

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that
originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying
creatures in this area take a -4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or
smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown
back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller
flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the
force of the wind.

   A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled
1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

   Small creatures are knocked [prone] by the force of the wind.

   Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the
force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 [Strength] check.

   Large or larger creatures may move normally within a _gust of
wind_effect.

   This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.

   Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged
attacks and Perception checks in the area of a _gust of wind_.

   The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches,
and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as
those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish
those lights.

   In addition to the effects noted, a _gust of wind_can do anything
that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a
stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate
awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors
to the edge of its range.

   _Gust of wind_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

14.1 Magic Items and Detect Magic
=================================

When _[detect magic]_identifies a magic item's school of magic, this
information refers to the school of the spell placed within the potion,
scroll, or wand, or the prerequisite given for the item. The
description of each item provides its aura strength and the school to
which it belongs.

   If more than one spell is given as a prerequisite, use the
highest-level spell. If no spells are included in the prerequisites,
use the following default guidelines.

Table: Random Magic Item Generation

   To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes
activation simply means putting a ring on your finger. Some items, once
donned, function constantly. In most cases, though, using an item
requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like
spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.

   Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item
description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell
is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless
of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically
states otherwise.

   The four ways to activate magic items are described below.

   *Spell Completion*: This is the activation method for scrolls. A
scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for
the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal
spellcasting. All that's left to do is perform the finishing parts of
the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell
completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the
right class to cast the spell already. If he can't already cast the
spell, there's a chance he'll make a mistake. Activating a spell
completion item is a standard action (or the spell's casting time,
whichever is longer) and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as
casting a spell does.

   *Spell Trigger*: Spell trigger activation is similar to spell
completion, but it's even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is
needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate
character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Spell
trigger items can be used by anyone whose class can cast the
corresponding spell. This is the case even for a character who can't
actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin. The user must still
determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it.
Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not
provoke attacks of opportunity.

   *Command Word*: If no activation method is suggested either in the
magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a
command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means
that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other
special knowledge is needed.

   A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the
holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by
speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word
is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient
language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item
is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

   Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on
the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design
engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might
bear a clue to the command word.

   The *note Knowledge: #knowledge. (arcana) and *note Knowledge:
#knowledge. (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify
command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check
against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check
is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some
insight into a clue. The spells _[detect magic], [identify],_and
_[analyze dweomer]_all reveal command words if the properties of the
item are successfully identified.

   *Use Activated*: This type of item simply has to be used in order to
activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword,
interpose a shield to deflect a blow in combat, look through a lens,
sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally
straightforward and self-explanatory.

   Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.
Continually functioning items are practically always items that one
wears. A few must simply be in the character's possession (meaning on
his person). However, some items made for wearing must still be
activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word
(see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to
happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is
needed in such a case.

   Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is
either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke
attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action
that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the
item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is
a standard action. If the item's activation is subsumed in its use and
takes no extra time use, activation is not an action at all.

   Use activation doesn't mean that if you use an item, you
automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)
what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it,
unless the benefit of the item comes automatically, such as from
drinking a potion or swinging a sword.

File: test.info,  Node: Size and Magic Items,  Up: Using Items

15.1 Size and Magic Items
=========================

When an article of magic clothing or jewelry is discovered, most of the
time size shouldn't be an issue. Many magic garments are made to be
easily adjustable, or they adjust themselves magically to the wearer.
Size should not keep characters of various kinds from using magic items.

   There may be rare exceptions, especially with race-specific items.

   *Armor and Weapon Sizes*: Armor and weapons that are found at random
have a 30% chance of being Small (01-30), a 60% chance of being Medium
(31-90), and a 10% chance of being any other size (91-100).

16 Magic Items on the Body
**************************

Many magic items need to be donned by a character who wants to employ
them or benefit from their abilities. It's possible for a creature with
a humanoid-shaped body to wear as many as 15 magic items at the same
time. However, each of those items must be worn on (or over) a
particular part of the body, known as a “slot.”

   A humanoid-shaped body can be decked out in magic gear consisting of
one item from each of the following groups, keyed to which slot on the
body the item is worn.

   *Armor*: suits of armor.

   *Belts*: belts and girdles.

   *Body*: robes and vestments.

   *Chest*: mantles, shirts, and vests.

   *Eyes*: eyes, glasses, and goggles.

   *Feet*: boots, shoes, and slippers.

   *Hands*: gauntlets and gloves.

   *Head*: circlets, crowns, hats, helms, and masks.

   *Headband*: headbands and phylacteries.

   *Neck*: amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, and
scarabs.

   *Ring (up to two)*: rings.

   *Shield*: shields.

   *Shoulders*: capes and cloaks.

   *Wrist*: bracelets and bracers.

   Of course, a character may carry or possess as many items of the
same type as he wishes. However, additional items beyond those in the
slots listed above have no effect.

   Some items can be worn or carried without taking up a slot on a
character's body. The description of an item indicates when an item has
this property.

17 Saving Throws Against Magic Item Powers
******************************************

Magic items produce spells or spell-like effects. For a saving throw
against a spell or spell-like effect from a magic item, the DC is 10 +
the level of the spell or effect + the ability modifier of the minimum
ability score needed to cast that level of spell.

   Staves are an exception to the rule. Treat the saving throw as if
the wielder cast the spell, including caster level and all modifiers to
save DCs.

   Most item descriptions give saving throw DCs for various effects,
particularly when the effect has no exact spell equivalent (making its
level otherwise difficult to determine quickly).


File: test.info,  Node: Damaging Magic Items,  Next: Purchasing Magic Items,  Prev: Saving Throws Against Magic Item Powers,  Up: Top

18 Damaging Magic Items
***********************

A magic item doesn't need to make a saving throw unless it is
unattended, it is specifically targeted by the effect, or its wielder
rolls a natural 1 on his save. Magic items should always get a saving
throw against spells that might deal damage to them--even against
attacks from which a nonmagical item would normally get no chance to
save. Magic items use the same saving throw bonus for all saves, no
matter what the type , [Reflex], or [Will]). A magic item's saving
throw bonus equals 2 + 1/2 its caster level (rounded down). The only
exceptions to this are intelligent magic items, which make [Will] saves
based on their own [Wisdom] scores.

   Magic items, unless otherwise noted, take damage as nonmagical items
of the same sort. A damaged magic item continues to function, but if it
is destroyed, all its magical power is lost. Magic items that take
damage in excess of half their total hit points, but not more than
their total hit points, gain the [broken] condition, and might not
function properly.

18.1 Repairing Magic Items
==========================

Repairing a magic item requires material components equal to half the
cost to create the item, and requires half the time. The _[make
whole]_spell can also repair a damaged (or even a destroyed) magic
items--if the caster is high enough level.


File: test.info,  Node: Charges Doses and Multiple Uses,  Prev: Repairing Magic Items,  Up: Damaging Magic Items

18.2 Charges, Doses, and Multiple Uses
======================================

Many items, particularly wands and staves, are limited in power by the
number of charges they hold. Normally, charged items have 50 charges at
most (10 for staves). If such an item is found as a random part of a
treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges
left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of
charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are
left.

   Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is
created, it is fully charged.) For an item that's worthless when its
charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the
value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of
charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its
charges, only part of the item's value is based on the number of
charges left.

   Magic items are valuable, and most major cities have at least one or
two purveyors of magic items, from a simple potion merchant to a weapon
smith that specializes in magic swords. Of course, not every item in
this book is available in every town.

   The following guidelines are presented to help GMs determine what
items are available in a given community. These guidelines assume a
setting with an average level of magic. Some cities might deviate
wildly from these baselines, subject to GM discretion. The GM should
keep a list of what items are available from each merchant and should
replenish the stocks on occasion to represent new acquisitions.

   The number and types of magic items available in a community depend
upon its size. Each community has a base value associated with it (see
Table: Available Magic Items). There is a 75% chance that any item of
that value or lower can be found for sale with little effort in that
community. In addition, the community has a number of other items for
sale. These items are randomly determined and are broken down by
category (minor, medium, or major). After determining the number of
items available in each category, refer to Table: Random Magic Item
Generation to determine the type of each item (potion, scroll, ring,
weapon, etc.) before moving on to the individual charts to determine
the exact item. Reroll any items that fall below the community's base
value.

   If you are running a campaign with low magic, reduce the base value
and the number of items in each community by half. Campaigns with
little or no magic might not have magic items for sale at all. GMs
running these sorts of campaigns should make some adjustments to the
challenges faced by the characters due to their lack of magic gear.

   Campaigns with an abundance of magic items might have communities
with twice the listed base value and random items available.
Alternatively, all communities might count as one size category larger
for the purposes of what items are available. In a campaign with very
common magic, all magic items might be available for purchase in a
metropolis.

   Nonmagical items and gear are generally available in a community of
any size unless the item is particularly expensive, such as full plate,
or made of an unusual material, such as an [adamantine] longsword.
These items should follow the base value guidelines to determine their
availability, subject to GM discretion.

20 Magic Item Descriptions
**************************

Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed
by descriptions of specific items.

   General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation,
and other material. The [AC], hardness, hit points, and break DC are
given for typical examples of some magic items. The [AC] assumes that
the item is unattended and includes a -5 penalty for the item's
effective [Dexterity] of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the
creature's [Dexterity] modifier in place of the -5 penalty.

   Some individual items, notably those that just store spells, don't
get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell's description for
details, modified by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so
on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to
cast it.

   Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of
the following topics is covered in notational form as part of its entry.

   *Aura*: Most of the time, a _[detect magic]_spell reveals the school
of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an
item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the
beginning of the item's notational entry. See the _[detect magic]_spell
description for details.

   *Caster Level (CL)*: The next item in a notational entry gives the
caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster
level determines the item's saving throw bonus, as well as range or
other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).
It also determines the level that must be contended with should the
item come under the effect of a _[dispel magic]_spell or similar
situation.

   For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster
level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell but
not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster
level is determined by the item itself.

   *Slot*: Most magic items can only be utilized if worn or wielded in
their proper slots. If the item is stowed or placed elsewhere, it does
not function. If the slot lists “none,” the item must be held or
otherwise carried to function.

   *Price*: This is the cost, in gold pieces, to purchase the item, if
it is available for sale. Generally speaking, magic items can be sold
by PCs for half this value.

   *Weight*: This is the weight of an item. When a weight figure is not
given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining
how much of a load a character can carry).

   *Description*: This section of a magic item describes the item's
powers and abilities. Potions, scrolls, staves, and wands refer to
various spells as part of their descriptions (see *note Spell Lists:
#spell-lists. for details on these spells).

   *Construction*: With the exception of artifacts, most magic items
can be built by a spellcaster with the appropriate feats and
prerequisites. This section describes those prerequisites.

   *Requirements*: Certain requirements must be met in order for a
character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and
miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind.
The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately
following the item's caster level.

   A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared
the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard),
or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or
a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each
day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one
spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either
of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.

   It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the
creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the
prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.

   If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must
agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the
purpose of determinations where the creator's level must be known.

   *Cost*: This is the cost in gold pieces to create the item.
Generally this cost is equal to half the price of an item, but
additional material components might increase this number. The cost to
create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of
the components.

21 Dwarves
**********

Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the
hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations
of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the
dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless craftsmen of
the earth. It could be said that dwarven history shapes the dark
disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and
dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants,
goblins, and other such horrors.

   *Physical Description*: Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and
stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies
that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride
themselves on the length of their hair, and men often decorate their
beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. A clean-shaven
male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse--no one familiar with
their race trusts a beardless dwarf.

   *Society*: The great distances between their mountain citadels
account for many of the cultural differences that exist within dwarven
society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are
characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and
metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and a fierce hatred of
giants, orcs, and goblinoids.

   *Relations*: Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity, theirs a
history of violence as old as both their races. Dwarves generally
distrust and shun half-orcs. They find halflings, elves, and gnomes to
be too frail, flighty, or “pretty” to be worthy of proper respect. It
is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans'
industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those
of the dwarven ideal.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition,
and while they are often satirized as standoffish, they have a strong
sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust
understand that, while they work hard, they play even
harder--especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful
good.

   *Adventurers*: Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to
humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often
leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to
find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or
to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare
is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such
most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.

22 Elves
********

The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many
superficial ways to fey creatures, yet different as well. Elves value
their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make
friends, at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is
accepted as a comrade, such alliances can last for generations. Elves
have a curious attachment to their surroundings, perhaps as a result of
their incredibly long lifespans or some deeper, more mystical reason.
Elves who dwell in a region for long find themselves physically
adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on
coloration reflecting the local environment. Those elves that spend
their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often
develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result
of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes.

   *Physical Description*: Although generally taller than humans, elves
possess a graceful, fragile physique that is accentuated by their long,
pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with
large, vibrantly colored pupils. While elven clothing often plays off
the beauty of the natural world, those elves that live in cities tend
to bedeck themselves in the latest fashion.

   *Society*: Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in
harmony with the natural world. Most, however, find manipulating earth
and stone to be distasteful, and prefer instead to indulge in the finer
arts, with their inborn patience making them particularly suited to
wizardry.

   *Relations*: Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them
off as rash and impulsive, yet they are excellent judges of character.
An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to
acknowledge that dwarf's skill at smithing. They regard gnomes as
strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, and halflings with a
measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift,
without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, as
evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world, even if they
usually disown such offspring. They regard half-orcs with distrust and
suspicion.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Elves are emotional and capricious, yet
value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good.

   *Adventurers*: Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to
explore the world, leaving their secluded forest realms to reclaim
forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia
ago by their forefathers. For those raised among humans, the ephemeral
and unfettered life of an adventurer holds natural appeal. Elves
generally eschew melee because of their frailty, preferring instead to
pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.

23 Gnomes
*********

Gnomes trace their lineage back to the mysterious realm of the fey, a
place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions
more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm
long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the
gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to
mortal culture. As a result, gnomes are widely regarded by the other
races as alien and strange.

   *Physical Description*: Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common
races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Their hair tends
toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the
verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of
wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy
browns to floral pinks, frequently with little regard for heredity.
Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and many have
overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing
and stunning, depending on the individual.

   *Society*: Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize
themselves within classic societal structures. Whimsical creatures at
heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever
seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring
relationships among themselves or with members of other races, instead
pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that
borders on zealotry. Male gnomes have a strange fondness for unusual
hats and headgear, while females often proudly wear elaborate and
eccentric hairstyles.

   *Relations*: Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other
races, on both emotional and physical levels. Gnome humor is hard to
translate and often comes across as malicious or senseless to other
races, while gnomes in turn tend to think of the taller races as dull
and lumbering giants. They get along well with halflings and humans,
but are overly fond of playing jokes on dwarves and half-orcs, whom
most gnomes feel need to lighten up. They respect elves, but often grow
frustrated with the comparatively slow pace at which members of the
long-lived race make decisions. To the gnomes, action is always better
than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects
with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest
periods.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters,
with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their
hearts are generally in the right place. They are prone to powerful
fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural
world.

   *Adventurers*: Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust makes them natural
adventurers. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of
life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing
adventurers. Gnomes make up for their weakness with a proclivity for
sorcery or bardic music.

24 Half-elves
*************

Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous
life spans, magical affinity, and inherent grace each contribute to the
admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all their traits,
however, none so entrance their human associates as their beauty. Since
the two races first came into contact with each other, the humans have
held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in the fair folk
idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find
humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, drawn to
the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play
out their brief lives.

   Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships.
Though usually short-lived, even by human standards, these trysts
commonly lead to the birth of half-elves, a race descended of two
cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one
another, but even these “pureblood” half-elves tend to be viewed as
bastards by humans and elves alike.

   *Physical Description*: Half-elves stand taller than humans but
shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of
their elven lineage, but their skin color is dictated by their human
side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are
more rounded and less pronounced. A half-elf's human-like eyes tend to
range a spectrum of exotic colors running from amber or violet to
emerald green and deep blue.

   *Society*: The lack of a unified homeland and culture forces
half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any
environment. While often attractive to both races for the same reasons
as their parents, half-elves rarely fit in with either humans or elves,
as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of
acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered
by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture
the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable,
capable of adjusting their mindsets and talents to whatever societies
they find themselves in.

   *Relations*: A half-elf understands loneliness, and knows that
character is often less a product of race than of life experience. As
such, half-elves are often open to friendships and alliances with other
races, and less likely to rely on first impressions when forming
opinions of new acquaintances.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Half-elves' isolation strongly influences
their characters and philosophies. Cruelty does not come naturally to
them, nor does blending in and bending to societal convention--as a
result, most half-elves are chaotic good. Half-elves' lack of a unified
culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do
generally follow the common faiths of their homeland.

   *Adventurers*: Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands
in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove
oneself to the community and establish a personal identity--or even a
legacy--drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery.

25 Half-orcs
************

Half-orcs are monstrosities, their tragic births the result of
perversion and violence--or at least, that's how other races see them.
It's true that half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as
such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting
for protection or to make names for themselves. Feared, distrusted, and
spat upon, half-orcs still consistently manage to surprise their
detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom--though sometimes
it's easier just to crack a few skulls.

   *Physical Description*: Both genders of half-orc stand between 6 and
7 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their
canines often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these
“tusks,” combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them
their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be
impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful.

   *Society*: Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's
discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the
worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also
tend to be feared or attacked outright by the legions of humans who
don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods.
Still, while not exactly accepted, half-orcs in civilized societies
tend to be valued for their martial prowess, and orc leaders have
actually been known to spawn them intentionally, as the halfbreeds
regularly make up for their lack of physical strength with increased
cunning and aggression, making them natural chieftains and strategic
advisors.

   *Relations*: A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc
wary and quick to anger, yet those who break through his savage
exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Elves and dwarves
tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a
resemblance to their racial enemies, but other races aren't much more
understanding. Human societies with few orc problems tend to be the
most accommodating, and there half-orcs make natural mercenaries and
enforcers.

   *Alignment & Religion*: Forced to live either among brutish orcs or
as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter,
violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not
evil by nature--rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been
taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that
which directly benefits themselves.

   *Adventurers*: Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives
of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or
improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or
desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to
prove their worth to the world.

26 Halflings
************

Optimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck and driven
by a powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature
with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and
easy-going, halflings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on
opportunity, and are not as prone as some of the more volatile races to
violent or emotional outbursts. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, a
halfling almost never loses his sense of humor.

   Halflings are inveterate opportunists. Unable to physically defend
themselves from the rigors of the world, they know when to bend with
the wind and when to hide away. Yet a halfling's curiosity often
overwhelms his good sense, leading to poor decisions and narrow escapes.

   Though their curiosity drives them to travel and seek new places and
experiences, halflings possess a strong sense of house and home, often
spending above their means to enhance the comforts of home life.

   *Physical Description*: Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet.
They prefer to walk barefoot, leading to the bottoms of their feet
being roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of
their broad, tanned feet. Their skin tends toward a rich almond color
and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling's ears are
pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.

   *Society*: Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no
settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Far more often,
they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking
out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many
halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger
neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives on the road, traveling
the world and experiencing all it has to offer.

   *Relations*: A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go
unnoticed by other races--it is this trait that allows so many
halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings, knowing
full well the stereotyped view other races take of them as a result, go
out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger races
when they're not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well
with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures
with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings coexist well with humans as a
general rule, but since some of the more aggressive human societies
value halflings as slaves, halflings try not to grow too complacent
when dealing with them. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but these
races generally live in remote regions far from the comforts of
civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for
interaction. Only half-orcs are generally shunned by halflings, for
their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for
most halflings to cope with.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Halflings are loyal to their friends and
families, but since they dwell in a world dominated by races twice as
large as themselves, they've come to grips with the fact that sometimes
they'll need to scrap and scrounge for survival. Most halflings are
neutral as a result.

   *Adventurers*: Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable
wanderlust makes halflings ideal for lives of adventure. Other such
vagabonds tend to put up with the curious race in hopes that some of
their mystical luck will rub off.

27 Humans
*********

Humans possess exceptional drive and a great capacity to endure and
expand, and as such are currently the dominant race in the world. Their
empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and the citizens of
these societies carve names for themselves with the strength of their
sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is best
characterized by its tumultuousness and diversity, and human cultures
run the gamut from savage but honorable tribes to decadent,
devil-worshiping noble families in the most cosmopolitan cities. Human
curiosity and ambition often triumph over their predilection for a
sedentary lifestyle, and many leave their homes to explore the
innumerable forgotten corners of the world or lead mighty armies to
conquer their neighbors, simply because they can.

   *Physical Description*: The physical characteristics of humans are
as varied as the world's climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the
southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern
lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and
facial features. Generally speaking, humans' skin color assumes a
darker hue the closer to the equator they live.

   *Society*: Human society comprises a multitude of governments,
attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their
histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the
societies of common races like elves and dwarves, human society seems
to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms
subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility,
ingenuity, and ambition.

   *Relations*: Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often
spur them into contact with other races during bouts of territorial
expansion and colonization. In many cases, this leads to violence and
war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with
races who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud,
sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as
miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves,
gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and half-orcs as
embarrassments--but the race's diversity among its own members also
makes humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are.

   *Alignment and Religion*: Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous
of all the common races, with a capacity for great evil and boundless
good. Some assemble into vast barbaric hordes, while others build
sprawling cities that cover miles. Taken as a whole, most humans are
neutral, yet they generally tend to congregate in nations and
civilizations with specific alignments. Humans also have the widest
range in gods and religion, lacking other races' ties to tradition and
eager to turn to anyone offering them glory or protection.

   *Adventurers*: Ambition alone drives countless humans, and for many,
adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether it be wealth, acclaim,
social status, or arcane knowledge. A few pursue adventuring careers
simply for the thrill of danger. Humans hail from myriad regions and
backgrounds, and as such can fill any role within an adventuring party.

   *Names*: Unlike other races, who generally cleave to specific
traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a
near-infinite set of names. The humans of a northern barbarian tribe
have much different names than those hailing from a subtropical nation
of sailors and tradesmen. Throughout most of the world humans speak
Common, yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.

#spell-resistance.* yes

   Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round
thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical
bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt
of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point
you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the
time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is
affected.

   You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions,
even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first
you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a
bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level
(maximum 10 bolts).

   If you are outdoors and in a stormy area--a rain shower, clouds and
wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a
whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* druid 1,
ranger 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* animals within 30 ft. of each other

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and
harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with [Intelligence] scores of 1
or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the
same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum
number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.

   The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or
flee. They are not [helpless] and defend themselves normally if
attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

   Calm Emotions

   *Calm Emotions*

   *School*enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2,
cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the
affected creatures, but _calm emotions_can stop raging creatures from
fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot
take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do
anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to
a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.

   This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale
bonuses granted by spells such as _[bless], [good hope],_and
_[rage],_and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a
barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and
removes the _[confused]_condition from all targets_._While the spell
lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the
_calm emotions_spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of
the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the
meantime.

   Cat's Grace

   *Cat's Grace*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 2, druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (pinch of cat fur)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and
coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Dexterity],
adding the usual benefits to [AC], [Reflex] saves, and other uses of
the [Dexterity] modifier.

   *Cat's Grace, Mass*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[cat's grace]_, except that it affects
multiple creatures.

   Cause Fear

   *Cause Fear*

   *School* necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 1, cleric
1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature with 5 or fewer HD

   *Duration* 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The affected creature becomes [frightened]. If the subject succeeds
on a [Will] save, it is [shaken] for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more
HD are immune to this effect. _Cause fear_counters and dispels _remove
fear_.

   Chain Lightning

   *Chain Lightning*

   *School* evocation [electricity]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a
crystal rod; plus one silver pin per caster level)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Targets* one primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each
of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single
stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike _[lightning bolt]_,
_chain lightning_strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to
other targets.

   The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level
(maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can
arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level
(maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as
much damage as the primary bolt.

   Each target can attempt a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage. The
[Reflex] DC to halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than
the DC to halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary
targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary
target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to
affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

   Changestaff

   *Changestaff*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 7

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, F (a quarterstaff that has been carved and
polished for 28 days)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* your touched staff

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge treant-like
creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end of the staff in
the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the
spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like
a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands.
However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with
actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or
fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed.
Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration
expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the
focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at
full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the
last time it appeared.

   Chaos Hammer

   *Chaos Hammer*

   *School* evocation [chaotic]; *Level* cleric 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* 20-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] partial; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes the
form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting energy. Only
lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are harmed by the spell.

   The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum
5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level,
maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them for 1d6 rounds *
spell). A successful [Will] save reduces the damage by half and negates
the [slow] effect.

   The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are neither
lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce
the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful [Will]
save.

   Charm Animal

   *Charm Animal*

   *School* enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; *Level* druid 1,
ranger 1

   *Target* one animal

   This spell functions like _charm person_, except that it affects a
creature of the animal type.

   Charm Monster

   *Charm Monster*

   *School* enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   This spell functions like _charm person_, except that the effect is
not restricted by creature type or size.

   *Charm Monster, Mass*

   *School* enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 6,
sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Components* V

   *Targets* One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   This spell functions like _[charm monster],_except that _mass charm
monster_affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed
twice your level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there
are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at
a time until you must choose a creature with too many HD to affect.

   Charm Person

   *Charm Person*

   *School* enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one humanoid creature

   *Duration* 1 hour/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted
friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the
creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your
allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

   The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it
were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most
favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win
an opposed [Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't
ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never
obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced
that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your
apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. You
must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else
be good at pantomiming.

   Chill Metal

   *Chill Metal*

   *School* transmutation [cold]; *Level* druid 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target*metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of
which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of metal/level, none of
which can be more than 30 ft. away from any of the rest

   *Duration* 7 rounds

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   _Chill metal_makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical
metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw
against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the
creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

   A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes
full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature
takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not
wearing or wielding such an item.

   On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and
uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs
on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also
the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the
third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes
more damage, as shown on the table below.

Round   Metal Temperature   Damage
----------------------------------------- 
1       Cold                None
2       Icy                 1d4 points
3-5     Freezing            2d4 points
6       Icy                 1d4 points
7       Cold                None

   Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage
from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater,
_chill metal_deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the
affected metal, making it float if unattended.

   _Chill metal_counters and dispels _[heat metal]_.

   Chill Touch

   *Chill Touch*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* creature or creatures touched (up to one/level)

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial or [Will] negates; see text;
**note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the
life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy
that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1
point of [Strength] damage unless it makes a successful [Fortitude]
saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per
level.

   An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it
must make a successful [Will] saving throw or flee as if [panicked] for
1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

   Circle of Death

   *Circle of Death*

   *School* necromancy [death]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a crushed black pearl worth 500 gp)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Circle of death_snuffs out the life force of living creatures,
killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living
creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the fewest HD
are affected first; among creatures with equal HD, those who are
closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No creature
of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that are not sufficient to
affect a creature are wasted.

   Clairaudience/Clairvoyance

   *Clairaudience/Clairvoyance*

   *School* divination (scrying); *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a small horn or a glass eye)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Effect*magical sensor

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   _Clairaudience/clairvoyance_creates an invisible magical sensor at a
specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost
as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect,
but the locale must be known--a place familiar to you, or an obvious
one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but
you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike
other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or
supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale
is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you
can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect.
_Clairaudience/clairvoyance_functions only on the plane of existence
you are currently occupying.

   Clenched Fist

   *Clenched Fist*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a leather glove)

   This spell functions like _[interposing hand],_except that the hand
can also push or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand
can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this
hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack [invisible] or
concealed creatures is no better than yours.

   The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your
caster level + your [Intelligence], [Wisdom], or [Charisma] modifier
(for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively) + 11 for the hand's
[Strength] score (33), - 1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11
points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a
[Fortitude] save (against this spell's save DC) or be [stunned] for 1
round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

   The _clenched fist_can also interpose itself as _[interposing
hand]_does, or it can bull rush an opponent as _[forceful hand]_does.
Its [CMB] for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its
base attack bonus, with a +11 bonus for its [Strength] score and a +1
bonus for being Large.

   Cloak of Chaos

   *Cloak of Chaos*

   *School* abjuration [chaotic]; *Level* cleric 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

   *Range* 20 ft.

   *Targets* one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them
from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful
creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to
become _[confused]._This abjuration has four effects.

   First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and
a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _[protection from law]_, the
benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against
attacks by lawful creatures.

   Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against
lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

   Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence,
just as _[protection from law]_does.

   Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a
warded creature, the offending attacker is _[confused]_for 1 round
([Will] save negates, as with the _[confusion]_spell, but against the
save DC of _cloak of chaos_).

   Clone

   *Clone*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (laboratory supplies worth 1,000 gp), F
(special laboratory equipment costing 500 gp)

   *Range* 0 ft.

   *Effect* one clone

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original
individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone,
creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to
return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist,
become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original
creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has
died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.

   To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair,
nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that
was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh
need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is
cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.

   When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it
immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically
identical to the original and possesses the same personality and
memories as the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it
were the original character raised from the dead, including its gaining
of two permanent [negative levels], just as if it had been hit by an
energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2
points of [Constitution] drain instead (if this would reduce its [Con]
to 0 or less, it can't be cloned). If the original creature gained
permanent [negative levels] since the flesh sample was taken, the clone
gains these [negative levels] as well.

   The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its
equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or
when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely
a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved.

   Cloudkill

   *Cloudkill*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial; see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a _[fog
cloud],_except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These
vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no
save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on
a [Fortitude] save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of [Constitution]
damage on your turn each round while in the cloud).

   A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of
[Constitution] damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a
successful [Fortitude] save halves this damage). Holding one's breath
doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the
spell.

   Unlike a _[fog cloud]_, the _cloudkill_moves away from you at 10
feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground.

   Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new point
of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of origin where
you cast the spell.

   Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest
level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It
cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

   Color Spray

   *Color Spray*

   *School* illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (red, yellow, and blue powder or colored sand)

   *Range* 15 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* instantaneous; see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand,
causing creatures to become [stunned], perhaps also [blinded], and
possibly knocking them [unconscious]. Each creature within the cone is
affected according to its HD.

   _2 HD or less_: The creature is [unconscious], [blinded], and
[stunned] for 2d4 rounds, then [blinded] and [stunned] for 1d4 rounds,
and then [stunned] for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked
[unconscious].)

   _3 or 4 HD_: The creature is [blinded] and [stunned] for 1d4 rounds,
then [stunned] for 1 round.

   _5 or more HD_: The creature is [stunned] for 1 round.

   Sightless creatures are not affected by _color spray_.

   Command

   *Command*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration* 1 round

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of
its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the
following options.

   _Approach_: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and
directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move
during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this
movement as normal.

   _Drop_: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It
can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

   _Fall_: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains
[prone] for 1 round. It may act normally while [prone] but takes any
appropriate penalties.

   _Flee_: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as
possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and
it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

   _Halt_: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any
actions but is not considered [helpless].

   If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the
spell automatically fails.

   *Command, Greater*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric 5

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   This spell functions like _[command],_except that up to one creature
per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round.
At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it
gets another [Will] save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each
creature must receive the same command.

   Command Plants

   *Command Plants*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 4, ranger 3

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more plant
creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and they
perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way (treat their
attitude as friendly). They will not attack you while the spell lasts.
You can try to give a subject orders, but you must win an opposed
[Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily
do. (Retries are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal
or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something
very dangerous is worth doing.

   You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level or
HD do not exceed twice your level.

   Command Undead

   *Command Undead*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a shred of raw meat and a splinter of bone)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one undead creature

   *Duration* 1 day/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead creature.
If the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words and actions
favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will not attack you
while the spell lasts. You can give the subject orders, but you must
win an opposed [Charisma] check to convince it to do anything it
wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are not allowed. An intelligent
commanded undead never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but
it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

   A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against this
spell. When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only
basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand
still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't resist suicidal or
obviously harmful orders.

   Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the commanded
undead (regardless of its [Intelligence]) breaks the spell.

   Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able
to hear you.

   Commune

   *Commune*

   *School* divination; *Level* cleric 5

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (holy or unholy water and incense worth 500
gp), DF

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   You contact your deity--or agents thereof--and ask questions that
can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular deity
contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed one such
question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the
limits of the entity's knowledge. “Unclear” is a legitimate answer,
because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily
omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or
contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less)
may be given as an answer instead.

   The spell, at best, provides information to aid character decisions.
The entities contacted structure their answers to further their own
purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or go off to do anything
else, the spell ends.

   Commune with Nature

   *Commune with Nature*

   *School* divination; *Level* druid 5, ranger 4

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* instantaneous

   You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the surrounding
territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as three facts from
among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals,
bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of
woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even
the general state of the natural setting.

   In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per
caster level. In natural underground settings--caves, caverns, and the
like--the spell is less powerful, and its radius is limited to 100 feet
per caster level. The spell does not function where nature has been
replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

   Comprehend Languages

   *Comprehend Languages*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (pinch of soot and salt)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise
incomprehensible written messages. The ability to read does not
necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal
meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown
language, not speak or write it.

   Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per
minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that
it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such
as the _[secret page]_and _[illusory script]_spells). It does not
decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

   _Comprehend languages_can be made permanent with a
_[permanency]_spell.

   Cone of Cold

   *Cone of Cold*

   *School* evocation [cold]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

   *Range* 60 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Cone of cold_creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your
hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6
points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

   Confusion

   *Confusion*

   *School*enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, M/DF (three nutshells)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Targets*all creatures in a 15-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration*1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell causes confusion in the targets_,_making them unable to
determine their actions. Roll on the following table at the start of
each subject's turn each round to see what it does in that round.

d%       Behavior
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
01-25    Act normally
26-50    Do nothing but babble incoherently
51-75    Deal 1d8 points of damage + [Str] modifier to self with item in hand
76-100   Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self)

   A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does
nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special
advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character
who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn,
as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a
confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any
creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of
its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

   *Confusion, Lesser*

   *School*enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*bard 1

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, DF

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target*one living creature

   *Duration*1 round

   *Saving Throw* [Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell causes a single creature to become [confused] for 1 round.

   Consecrate

   *Consecrate*

   *School* evocation [good]; *Level* cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of silver
dust), DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area* 20-ft.-radius emanation

   *Duration* 2 hours/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist
positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus.
Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers minor
disruption, suffering a -1 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and
saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned into a consecrated
area. If the consecrated area contains an altar, shrine, or other
permanent fixture dedicated to your deity, pantheon, or aligned higher
power, the modifiers given above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to
positive channeled energy DCs, -2 penalties for undead in the area).

   You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity
other than your own patron. Instead, the _consecrate_spell curses the
area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or power.
This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the bonuses and
penalties relating to undead, as given above.

   _Consecrate_counters and dispels _[desecrate]_.

   Contact Other Plane

   *Contact Other Plane*

   *School* divination; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* concentration

   You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane
or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and
information from powers there. See the accompanying table for possible
consequences and results of the attempt. The powers reply in a language
you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief
answers to your questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,”
“maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or some other one-word answer.

   You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action) in
order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is
answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question
for every two caster levels.

   Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the
probability that you will incur a decrease in [Intelligence] and
[Charisma] due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the
chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once
the Outer Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted
determines the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are
subject to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions,
this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces.

   _Avoid Int/[Cha] Decrease_: You must succeed on an [Intelligence]
check against this DC to avoid a decrease in [Intelligence] and
[Charisma]. If the check fails, your [Intelligence] and [Charisma]
scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to
cast arcane spells. You cannot take 10 on this check. If you lose
[Intelligence] and [Charisma], the effect strikes as soon as the first
question is asked, and no answer is received. If a successful contact
is made, roll d% to determine the type of answer you gain.

   _True Answer_: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that
cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.

   _Don't Know_: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.

   _Lie_: The entity intentionally lies to you.

   _Random Answer_: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the
answer, so it makes one up.

   Contagion

   *Contagion*

   *School* necromancy [evil]; *Level* cleric 3, druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The subject contracts one of the following diseases: [blinding
sickness], [bubonic plague], [cackle fever], [filth fever], [leprosy],
[mindfire], [red ache], [shakes], or [slimy doom]. The disease is
contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the
disease's listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects.
For more information see *note Diseases: #diseases.

   Contingency

   *Contingency*

   *School* evocation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* at least 10 minutes; see text

   *Components* V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using
creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

   You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into
effect under some condition you dictate when casting _contingency_. The
_contingency_spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time.
The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if
the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that
instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell
when you cast _contingency._

   The spell to be brought into effect by the _contingency_must be one
that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than
one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).

   The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear,
although they can be general. In all cases, the
_contingency_immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the
latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances
occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the
whole spell combination (_contingency_and the companion magic) may fail
when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated
conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

   You can use only one _contingency_spell at a time; if a second is
cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

   Continual Flame

   *Continual Flame*

   *School* evocation [light]; *Level* cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* object touched

   *Effect*magical, heatless flame

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an
object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it
creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A _continual flame_can be
covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.

   Light spells counter and dispel [darkness] spells of an equal or
lower level.

   Control Plants

   *Control Plants*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant
creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by
voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even
if vocal communication is impossible, the controlled plants do not
attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their
normal behavior.

   Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.

   Control Undead

   *Control Undead*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a piece of bone and a piece of raw meat)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* up to 2 HD/level of undead creatures, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short
period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no
matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is
impossible, the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the
spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

   [Int]elligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them,
and they may seek revenge after the spell's effects end.

   Control Water

   *Control Water*

   *School* transmutation [water]; *Level* cleric 4, druid 4,
sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a pinch of dust for _lower water or_a drop
of water for _raise water_)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area*water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2
ft./level (S)

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   This spell has two different applications, both of which control
water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes water
in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground below,
lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the water to
surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and possibly flooding
nearby areas.

   _Lower Water_: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its
depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth of 1
inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression whose sides
are up to caster level × 10 feet long. In extremely large and deep
bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool
that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and
rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of
the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based
creatures, this spell acts as a _[slow]_spell ([Will] negates). The
spell has no effect on other creatures.

   _Raise Water_: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in
height, just as the _lower water_version causes it to lower. Boats
raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that the spell
creates. If the area affected by the spell includes riverbanks, a
beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill over onto dry land.

   With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal
dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to change
the overall area of effect.

   Control Weather

   *Control Weather*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* cleric 7, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes; see text

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 2 miles

   *Area* 2-mile-radius circle, centered on you; see text

   *Duration* 4d12 hours; see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to
cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to
manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and
season of the area you are in. You can also use this spell to cause the
weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season.

Season        Possible Weather
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Spring        Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather
Summer        Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm
Autumn        Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet
Winter        Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw
Late winter   Hurricane-force winds or early spring

   You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the
direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific
applications of the weather--where lightning strikes, for example, or
the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left it for
the duration, or until you use a standard action to designate a new
kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later).
Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously.

   _Control weather_can do away with atmospheric phenomena (naturally
occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

   A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a circle
with a 3-mile radius.

   Control Winds

   *Control Winds*

   *School* transmutation [air]; *Level* druid 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 40 ft./level

   *Area* 40 ft./level radius cylinder 40 ft. high

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make the
wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its strength, or
decrease its strength. The new wind direction and strength persist
until the spell ends or until you choose to alter your handiwork, which
requires concentration. You may create an “eye” of calm air up to 80
feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire, and you
may choose to limit the area to any cylindrical area less than your
full limit.

   _Wind Direction_: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns to
function over the spell's area.

   * A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength in all
     directions.

   * An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in
     equal strength from all directions, veering upward before
     impinging on the eye in the center.

   * Rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise or
     counterclockwise fashion.

   * A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction across
     the entire area from one side to the other.

   _Wind Strength_: For every three caster levels, you can increase or
decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn, a
creature in the wind must make a [Fortitude] save or suffer the effect
of being in the windy area. See [Environment] for more details.

   Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.

   A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.

   A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the skies,
uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures, tears off
roofs, and endangers ships.

   Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, uproot
large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

   A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and often
uproots large trees.

   Create Food and Water

   *Create Food and Water*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* cleric 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* food and water to sustain three humans or one horse/level
for 24 hours

   *Duration* 24 hours; see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your
choice--highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and
becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for
another 24 hours by casting a _purify food and water_spell on it. The
water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it
doesn't go bad as the food does.

   Create Greater Undead

   *Create Greater Undead*

   *School* necromancy [evil]; *Level* cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

   This spell functions like _[create undead],_ except that you can
create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows, wraiths,
spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead created is based
on caster level, as shown below.

Caster Level     Undead Created
---------------------------------- 
15th or lower    Shadow
16th-17th        Wraith
18th-19th        Spectre
20th or higher   Devourer

   Create Undead

   *Create Undead*

   *School* necromancy [evil]; *Level* cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 hour

   *Components* V, S, M (a clay pot filled with grave dirt and an onyx
gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one corpse

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   A much more potent spell than _[animate dead],_this evil spell
allows you to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more
powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type
or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as
shown on the table below.

Caster Level     Undead Created
---------------------------------- 
11th or lower    Ghoul
12th-14th        Ghast
15th-17th        Mummy
18th or higher   Mohrg

   You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if
you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of
their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may
attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

   This spell must be cast at night.

   Create Water

   *Create Water*

   *School* conjuration (creation) [water]; *Level* cleric 0, druid 0,
paladin 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* up to 2 gallons of water/level

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean
rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually
contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large--possibly
creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles. This water
disappears after 1 day if not consumed.

   _Note_: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within
a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of
water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

   Creeping Doom

   *Creeping Doom*

   *School*conjuration (summoning); *Level*druid 7

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)/100 ft.; see text

   *Effect*four swarms of insects

   *Duration*1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial, see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging
insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be
directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede swarms
with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit points each and
deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack. The save to resist
their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this
spell. Creatures caught in multiple swarms only take damage and make
saves once.

   You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other
creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of the
swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You cannot
command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from you, and if you
move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that swarm remains stationary,
attacking any creatures in its area (but can be commanded again if you
move within 100 feet).

   Crushing Despair

   *Crushing Despair*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M

   *Range* 30 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the subjects.
Each affected creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving
throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.

   _Crushing despair_ counters and dispels _[good hope]_.

   Crushing Hand

   *Crushing Hand*

   *School*evocation [force]; *Level*sorcerer/wizard 9

   This spell functions as _[interposing hand]_, except that it can
also grapple one opponent as _[grasping hand]_. Its [CMB] and [CMD] for
grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus,
with a +12 bonus for its [Strength] score (35) and a +1 bonus for being
Large (its [Dexterity] is 10, granting no bonus to the [CMD]). A
_crushing hand_deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple
check against an opponent. The _crushing hand_ can instead be directed
to bull rush a target (as _[forceful hand]_), using the same bonuses
outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as
_[interposing hand]_ does.

   Cure Critical Wounds

   *Cure Critical Wounds*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* bard 4, cleric 4, druid 5

   This spell functions like _[cure light wounds]_, except that it
cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

   *Cure Critical Wounds, Mass*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 8, druid 9

   Cure Light Wounds

   *Cure Light Wounds*

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] half (harmless); see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless); see text

   When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive
energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell
deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature
can apply [spell resistance], and can attempt a [Will] save to take
half damage.

text

per caster level (maximum +25) on each selected creature. Like other
_cure_spells, _mass cure light wounds_deals damage to undead in its
area rather than curing them. Each affected undead may attempt a [Will]
save for half damage.

Some abilities are not tied to your race, class, or skill--things like
particularly quick reflexes that allow you to react to danger more
swiftly, the ability to craft magic items, the training to deliver
powerful strikes with melee weapons, or the knack for deflecting arrows
fired at you. These abilities are represented as feats. While some
feats are more useful to certain types of characters than others, and
many of them have special prerequisites that must be met before they
are selected, as a general rule feats represent abilities outside of
the normal scope of your character's race and class. Many of them alter
or enhance class abilities or soften class restrictions, while others
might apply bonuses to your statistics or grant you the ability to take
actions otherwise prohibited to you. By selecting feats, you can
customize and adapt your character to be uniquely yours.

29 Prerequisites
****************

Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated
ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other
quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can
gain a feat at the same level at which he gains the prerequisite.

   A character can't use a feat if he loses a prerequisite, but he does
not lose the feat itself. If, at a later time, he regains the lost
prerequisite, he immediately regains full use of the feat that
prerequisite enables.

30 Types of Feats
*****************

Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a
group. Others are item creation feats, which allow characters to create
magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare
and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were of a
higher spell level than it actually is.

30.1 Combat Feats
=================

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's
bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other
classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet the
prerequisites.


File: test.info,  Node: Critical Feats,  Next: [Item Creation Feats],  Prev: Combat Feats,  Up: Types of Feats

30.2 Critical Feats
===================

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an
additional condition on the victim of the critical hit. Characters
without the Critical Mastery feat can only apply the effects of one
critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple
critical feats can decide which feat to apply after the critical hit
has been confirmed.

30.3 [Item Creation Feats]
==========================

An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain
type. Regardless of the type of item each involves, the various item
creation feats all have certain features in common.

   *Raw Materials Cost*: The cost of creating a magic item equals half
the base price of the item.

   Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or
magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has
access to what he needs unless unusual circumstances apply.

   *Time*: The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the
cost of the item.

   *Item Cost*: [Brew Potion], [Craft Staff], [Craft Wand], and [Scribe
Scroll] create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the
power of these items depends on their caster level--that is, a spell
from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster
of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw
materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be
low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at
that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster
level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as
shown below:

   *_Scrolls:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 25 gp.*
*_Potions:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 50 gp.*
*_Wands:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 750 gp.*
_*_Staves:* The price for staves is calculated using more **complex
formulas ).*

   A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the
purpose of this calculation.

   *Extra Costs*: Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with
a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For
potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component
cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend 50
units of the material component. Some magic items similarly incur extra
costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.

   *Skill Check*: Successfully creating a magic item requires a
Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 5 + the item's caster level.
Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to
attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See
[Magic Item Creation] for more details on which Craft and Profession
checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can
increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the
prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check
that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item. See [Magic Items] for
more details.

30.4 [Metamagic Feats]
======================

As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast
spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Preparing and casting
a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic
feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a
spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the
spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic
feats do not affect spell-like abilities.

   *Wizards and Divine Spellcasters*: Wizards and divine spellcasters
must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character
chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which
ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).

   *Sorcerers and Bards*: Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they
cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply
their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the
improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because the sorcerer
or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he
must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character
must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a
metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's
normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version
is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as
a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by
the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the
feat.

   For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round
action to cast the spell.

   *Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats*: A cleric spontaneously
casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a
_summon nature's ally_spell, can cast a metamagic version of it
instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard
action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a
spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to
cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell
feat, which can be cast as a swift action.

   *Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell*: In all ways, a metamagic
spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared
and cast using a higher-level spell slot. Saving throw modifications
are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.

   The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast
directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to
alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.

   Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate
the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened.
Casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of
opportunity.

   Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific
feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.

   *Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell*: A spellcaster can apply
multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are
cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a
single spell.

   *Magic Items and Metamagic Spells*: With the right item creation
feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion,
or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher
spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character
doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic
version of a spell.

   *Counterspelling Metamagic Spells*: Whether or not a spell has been
enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to
counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell ).

31 Feat Descriptions
********************

Feats are summarized on Table: Feats below. Note that the prerequisites
and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of
reference. See the feats description for full details.

   The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

   *Feat Name*: The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if
any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of
what the feat does.

   *Prerequisite*: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a
minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more
skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry
is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one
prerequisite.

   *Benefit*: What the feat enables the character (“you” in the feat
description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once,
its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

   *Normal:* What a character who does not have this feat is limited to
or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular
drawback, this entry is absent.

   *Special:* Additional unusual facts about the feat.

Undead that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your

day to resist your command. You can control any number of undead, so
long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your cleric level. If you
use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not
heal or harm nearby creatures). If an undead creature is under the
control of another creature, you must make an opposed [Charisma] check
whenever your orders conflict.

You attract followers to your cause and a companion to join you on your
adventures.

   *Prerequisite:* Character level 7th.

   *Benefits:* This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a
number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an
NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs.
See Table: Leadership for what level of cohort and how many followers
you can recruit.

   *Leadership Modifiers:* Several factors can affect your Leadership
score, causing it to vary from the base score

   modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or
follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership
score:

Leader's Reputation Modifier ------------------------ --------- Great
renown +2 Fairness and generosity +1 Special power +1 Failure -1
Aloofness -1 Cruelty -2

Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed
below.

The Leader...

   Modifier

   Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion

   -2

   Recruits a cohort of a different alignment

   -1

   Caused the death of a cohort

   -2*

   * Cumulative per cohort killed.

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to
attract a follower, use the following modifiers.

The Leader... Modifier
------------------------------------------------------- --------- Has a
stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. +2 Moves around a lot
-1 Caused the death of other followers -1

_Leadership Score_: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus
your [Charisma] modifier. In order to take into account negative
[Charisma] modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores,
but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the
Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as
detailed above.

   _Cohort Level_: You can attract a cohort of up to this level.
Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who
is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be
equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see *note Creating NPCs:
#creating-npcs.). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's
alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos
or good/evil axis, and you take a -1 penalty to your Leadership score
if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.
A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's
XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this
result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of
experience points to the cohort's total.

   If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than
your level, the cohort does not gain the new level--its new XP total is
1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.

   _Number of Followers by Level_: You can lead up to the indicated
number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts,
except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or
more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat.

   Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you
gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire
more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing
followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels,
however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.

rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are
making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using

perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round
as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than

you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you
could attack if you were using a bow.

   *Normal:* A character without this feat needs a move action to
reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a
heavy crossbow.

   *Special:* You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you
take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.

   *Prerequisites:* [Critical Focus], base attack bonus +13.

   *Benefit:* Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes
[staggered] for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful [Fortitude] save reduces the
duration to 1 round. The DC of this [Fortitude] save is equal to 10 +
your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack.
Additional hits instead add to the duration.

   *Special:* You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a
given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.

You can stop foes that try to move past you.

   *Prerequisites:* [Combat Reflexes].

moving through your adjacent squares, you can make a combat maneuver
check as your attack of opportunity. If successful, the enemy cannot
move for the rest of his turn. An enemy can still take the rest of his
action, but cannot move. This feat also applies to any creature that
attempts to move from a square that is adjacent to you if such movement
provokes an attack of opportunity.

away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action
so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability.
If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next
turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5
feet from your total movement.

===========================================

Your critical hits cause opponents to become stunned.

   *Prerequisites:* [Critical Focus], [Staggering Critical], base
attack bonus +17.

   *Benefit:* Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes
[stunned] for 1d4 rounds. A successful [Fortitude] save reduces this to

given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.

=============================

You know just where to strike to temporarily stun a foe.

   *Prerequisites:* [Dex] 13, [Wis] 13, [Improved Unarmed Strike], base
attack bonus +8.

   *Benefit:* You must declare that you are using this feat before you
make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt).
Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a
[Fortitude] saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your [Wis]
modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails
this saving throw is [stunned] for 1 round (until just before your next
turn). A stunned character drops everything held, can't take actions,
loses any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], and takes a -2 penalty to [AC].
You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels
you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.
Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, [incorporeal] creatures, and
creatures immune to critical hits cannot be [stunned].

   *Special:* A monk receives Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st
level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a
stunning attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus
one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other
than monk.

effect. The DC for this [Will] save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric
level + your [Charisma] modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for
1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to
end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other
effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).

your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An
unarmed strike is always considered light.

   When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus
or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.

You can cast your spells so that they occupy a larger space.

   *Benefit:* You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread-shaped spell

   *Hallow*

   *School* evocation [good]; *Level* cleric 5, druid 5

   *Casting Time* 24 hours

   *Components* V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000
gp, plus 1,000 gp per level of the spell to be included in the
_hallowed_area), DF

   *Range* touch

   *Area* 40-ft. radius emanating from the touched point

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* see text

   _Hallow_makes a particular site, building, or structure a holy site.
This has four major effects.

   First, the site is warded by a _[magic circle against evil]_effect.

   Second, the DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area
gains a +4 sacred bonus and the DC to resist negative energy is reduced
by 4. [Spell resistance] does not apply to this effect. This provision
does not apply to the druid version of the spell.

   Third, any dead body interred in a _hallowed_site cannot be turned
into an undead creature.

   Finally, you can fix a single spell effect to the _hallowed_site.
The spell effect lasts for 1 year and functions throughout the entire
site, regardless of the normal duration and area or effect. You may
designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures who
share your faith or alignment, or creatures who adhere to another faith
or alignment. At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it
can be renewed or replaced simply by casting _hallow_again.

   Spell effects that may be tied to a _hallowed_site include _[aid],
[bane], [bless], [cause fear], [darkness], [daylight], [death ward],
[deeper darkness], [detect evil], [detect magic], [dimensional anchor],
[discern lies], [dispel magic], [endure elements], [freedom of
movement], [invisibility purge], [protection from energy], [remove
fear], [resist energy], [silence], [tongues],_and _[zone of truth]_.
Saving throws and [spell resistance] might apply to these spells'
effects. (See the individual spell descriptions for details.)

   An area can receive only one _hallow_spell (and its associated spell
effect) at a time. _Hallow_counters but does not dispel _[unhallow]_.

   Hallucinatory Terrain

   *Hallucinatory Terrain*

   *School* illusion (glamer); *Level* bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a green leaf)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area* one 30-ft. cube/level (S)

   *Duration* 2 hours/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You make natural terrain look, sound, and smell like some other sort
of natural terrain. Structures, equipment, and creatures within the
area are not hidden or changed in appearance.

   Halt Undead

   *Halt Undead*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Targets* up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (see text); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A
nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent
undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead
creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect
of _[hold person]_on a living creature). The effect is broken if the
_halted_creatures are attacked or take damage.

   Harm

   *Harm*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* cleric 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] half; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Harm_charges a subject with negative energy that deals 10 points of
damage per caster level (to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level). If
the creature successfully saves, _harm_deals half this amount. _Harm_
cannot reduce the target's hit points to less than 1.

   If used on an undead creature, _harm_acts like _[heal]_.

   Haste

   *Haste*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates (harmless); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This
extra speed has several effects.

   When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one
extra attack with one natural or manufactured weapon. The attack is
made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers
appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with
similar effects, such as that provided by a _speed_ weapon, nor does it
actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second
spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

   A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 [dodge
bonus] to [AC] and [Reflex] saves. Any condition that makes you lose
your [Dexterity] bonus to *note Armor Class: #armor-class. (if any)
also makes you lose [dodge bonus]es.

   All of the hasted creature's modes of movement (including land
movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a
maximum of twice the subject's normal speed using that form of
movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects
the creature's jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple
_haste_effects don't stack. _Haste_dispels and counters _[slow]._

   Heal

   *Heal*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 6, druid 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   _Heal_enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe
away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the
following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage,
[blinded], [confused]_,_[dazed], [dazzled], [deafened], diseased,
[exhausted], [fatigued], [feeblemind]ed_,_[insanity], [nauseated],
poisoned, [sickened], and [stunned]. It also cures 10 hit points of
damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th
level.

   _Heal_does not remove [negative levels] or restore permanently
drained ability score points.

   If used against an undead creature, _heal_instead acts like _[harm]_.

   *Heal, Mass*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* cleric 9

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[heal],_except as noted above. The
maximum number of hit points restored to each creature is 250.

   Heal Mount

   *Heal Mount*

   *School* conjuration (healing); *Level* paladin 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* your mount touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell functions like _[heal],_but it affects only the paladin's
special mount (typically a horse).

   Heat Metal

   *Heat Metal*

   *School* transmutation [fire]; *Level* druid 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target*metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of
which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of metal/level, all of
which must be within a 30-ft. circle

   *Duration* 7 rounds

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   _Heat metal_causes metal objects to become red-hot. Unattended,
nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a
saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses
the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

   A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes
full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature
takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not
wearing or wielding such an item.

   On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes warm and
uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs
on the last round of the spell's duration. During the second (and also
the next-to-last) round, intense heat causes pain and damage. In the
third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is searing hot, and causes
more damage, as shown on the table below.

Round   Metal Temperature   Damage
----------------------------------------- 
1       Warm                None
2       Hot                 1d4 points
3-5     Searing             2d4 points
6       Hot                 1d4 points
7       Warm                None

   Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage
from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. If cast
underwater, _heat metal_deals half damage and boils the surrounding
water.

   _Heat metal_counters and dispels _[chill metal]_.

   Helping Hand

   *Helping Hand*

   *School* evocation; *Level* cleric 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 5 miles

   *Effect* ghostly hand

   *Duration* 1 hour/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You create the ghostly image of a hand, which you can send to find a
creature within 5 miles. The hand then beckons to that creature and
leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.

   When the spell is cast, you specify a person (or any creature) by
physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance
but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the
description is done, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that
fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject
depends on how far away he is, as detailed on the following table.

Distance          Time to Locate
----------------------------------- 
100 ft. or less   1 round
1,000 ft.         1 minute
1 mile            10 minutes
2 miles           1 hour
3 miles           2 hours
4 miles           3 hours
5 miles           4 hours

   Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow
it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction,
indicating the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in
front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240
feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it
disappears.

   The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any
particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the
hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then
disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you,
the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on its own devices to
locate you.

   If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description,
the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to
follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.

   If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no
subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you,
displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was
found), and disappears.

   The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is [invisible] to anyone
except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or
execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it
back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze
through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5
miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.

   Heroes' Feast

   *Heroes' Feast*

   *School*conjuration [creation]; *Level*bard 6, cleric 6

   *Casting Time*10 minutes

   *Components*V, S, DF

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect*feast for one creature/level

   *Duration*1 hour plus 12 hours; see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table,
chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume,
and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Every
creature partaking of the feast is cured of all sickness and nausea,
receives the benefits of both _[neutralize poison]_ and _[remove
disease]_, and gains 1d8 temporary hit points + 1 point per two caster
levels (maximum +10) after imbibing the nectar-like beverage that is
part of the feast. The ambrosial food grants each creature that
partakes a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and [Will] saves and a +4
morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12
hours.

   If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and
all effects of the spell are negated.

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell imbues a single creature with great bravery and morale in
battle. The target gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and
skill checks.

   *Heroism, Greater*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 5,
sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   This spell functions like _[heroism],_except the creature gains a +4
morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear
effects, and temporary hit points equal to your caster level (maximum
20).

   Hide from Animals

   *Hide from Animals*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* druid 1, ranger 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* one creature touched/level

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or
supernatural sensory capabilities, such as [blindsense], [blindsight],
[scent], and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures.
Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a
warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a
spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

   Hide from Undead

   *Hide from Undead*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* one touched creature/level

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   Undead cannot see, hear, or smell creatures warded by this spell.
Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as
[blindsense], [blindsight], [scent], and tremorsense, cannot detect or
locate warded creatures. Nonintelligent undead creatures (such as
skeletons or zombies) are automatically affected and act as though the
warded creatures are not there. An intelligent undead creature gets a
single [Will] saving throw. If it fails, the subject can't see any of
the warded creatures. If it has reason to believe unseen opponents are
present, however, it can attempt to find or strike them. If a warded
creature attempts to channel positive energy, turn or command undead,
touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature (even with a
spell), the spell ends for all recipients.

   Hideous Laughter

   *Hideous Laughter*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (tiny fruit tarts and a feather)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one creature; see text

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It
collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling [prone]. The subject
can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered [helpless].
After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn,
it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full
round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save
is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing
for the entire duration.

   A creature with an [Intelligence] score of 2 or lower is not
affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives
a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't “translate” well.

   Hold Animal

   *Hold Animal*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* druid 2,
ranger 2

   *Components*: V, S

   *Target* one animal

   This spell functions like _[hold person],_except that it affects an
animal instead of a humanoid.

   Hold Monster

   *Hold Monster*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 4,
sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Components*: V, S, M/DF (one hard metal bar or rod, which can be as
small as a three-penny nail)

   *Target* one living creature

   This spell functions like _[hold person],_except that it affects any
living creature that fails its [Will] save.

   *Hold Monster, Mass*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Targets* one or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[hold person],_except that it affects
multiple creatures and holds any living creature that fails its [Will]
save.

   Hold Person

   *Hold Person*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2,
cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a small, straight piece of iron)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one humanoid creature

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D); see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   The subject becomes [paralyzed] and freezes in place. It is aware
and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each
round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end
the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks
of opportunity. A winged creature who is [paralyzed] cannot flap its
wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown.

   *Hold Person, Mass*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level*
sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Targets* one or more humanoid creatures, no two of which can be
more than 30 ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[hold person],_except as noted above.

   Hold Portal

   *Hold Portal*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Component*V

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one portal, up to 20 sq. ft./level

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of
wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were
securely closed and normally locked. A _[knock]_spell or a successful
_[dispel magic]_spell can negate a _hold portal_spell.

   Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this
spell.

   Holy Aura

   *Holy Aura*

   *School* abjuration [good]; *Level* cleric 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

   *Range* 20 ft.

   *Targets* one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them
from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil
creatures, and causing evil creatures to become [blinded] when they
strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

   First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and
a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _[protection from evil]_, this
benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil
creatures.

   Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against
evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

   Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and
mental influence, just as _[protection from evil]_does.

   Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a
creature warded by a _holy aura_, the offending attacker is [blinded]
([Fortitude] save negates, as _[blindness/deafness]_, but against _holy
aura's_save DC).

   Holy Smite

   *Holy Smite*

   *School* evocation [good]; *Level* cleric 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* 20-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* instantaneous (1 round); see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] partial; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and
neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are
unaffected.

   The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum
5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per
caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to
become [blinded] for 1 round. A successful [Will] saving throw reduces
damage to half and negates the [blinded] effect.

   The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good
nor evil, and they are not [blinded]. Such a creature can reduce that
damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful
[Will] save.

   Holy Sword

   *Holy Sword*

   *School* evocation [good]; *Level* paladin 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target*melee weapon touched

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any
other melee weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a _+5 holy weapon_(+5
enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, extra 2d6 damage against
evil opponents). It also emits a _[magic circle against evil]_effect
(as the spell). If the _magic circle_ends, the sword creates a new one
on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1
round after the weapon leaves your hand. You cannot have more than one
_holy sword_at a time.

   If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell
supercede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal
enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration
of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with _bless weapon_or any
other spell that might modify the weapon in any way. This spell does
not work on artifacts. A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not
stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.

   Holy Word

   *Holy Word*

   *School* evocation [good, sonic]; *Level* cleric 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* 40 ft.

   *Area* nongood creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on you

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Will] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Any nongood creature within the area of a _holy word_spell suffers
the following ill effects.

HD                       Effect
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Equal to caster level    [Deafened]
Up to caster level -1    [Blinded], [deafened]
Up to caster level -5    [Paralyzed], [blinded], [deafened]
Up to caster level -10   Killed, [paralyzed], [blinded], [deafened]

   The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful [Will] save
reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple
effects make only one save and apply the result to all the effects.

   _Deafened_: The creature is [deafened] for 1d4 rounds. Save negates.

   _Blinded_: The creature is [blinded] for 2d4 rounds. Save reduces
the [blinded] effect to 1d4 rounds.

   _Paralyzed_: The creature is [paralyzed] and [helpless] for 1d10
minutes. Save reduces the [paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

   _Killed_: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. Save
negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes 3d6
points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +25).

   Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell,
nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished
back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at
least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the
creatures hear the _holy word_ or not_._The banishment effect allows a
[Will] save (at a -4 penalty) to negate.

   Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by _holy
word._

   Horrid Wilting

   *Horrid Wilting*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a bit of sponge)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Targets* living creatures, no two of which can be more than 60 ft.
apart

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] half; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell evaporates moisture from the body of each subject living
creature, causing flesh to wither and crack and crumble to dust. This
deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). This spell
is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures,
which instead take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).

   Hypnotic Pattern

   *Hypnotic Pattern*

   *School* illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V (bard only), S, M (a stick of incense or a crystal
rod); see text

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* colorful lights in a 10-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* Concentration + 2 rounds

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the
air, fascinating creatures within it. Roll 2d4 and add your caster
level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of HD of creatures
affected. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among
creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a
creature are wasted. Affected creatures become [fascinated] by the
pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

   A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but
a bard must perform as a verbal component.

   Hypnotism

   *Hypnotism*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area* several living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* 2d4 rounds (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use
their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more
plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total HD of creatures you affect.
Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more HD.
Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do not
need to understand you to be [fascinated].

   If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its
saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat
at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2.

   While the subject is [fascinated] by this spell, it reacts as though
it were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a
single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate
with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the
spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only
with respect to that particular request.

   A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you
enspelled it.

   *Sanctuary*

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even
with a targeted spell, must attempt a [Will] save. If the save
succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that
casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow
through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't
directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell.
Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This
spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or
affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without
breaking the spell but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act.

   *Scare*

   *School* necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2,

   *Targets* one living creature per three levels, no two of which can
be more than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 round/level or 1 round; see text for _cause fear_

   *Saving Throw*[Will] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell functions like _cause fear,_except that it causes all
targeted creatures of less than 6 HD to become [frightened].

   *Duration* concentration + 2 rounds

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A twisting pattern of coruscating colors weaves through the air,
affecting creatures within. The spell affects a total number of HD of
creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the
fewest HD are affected first, and among creatures with equal HD, those
who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD
that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell
affects each subject according to its HD.

   _6 or less_: [Unconscious] for 1d4 rounds, then [stunned] for 1d4
rounds, and then _[confused]_for 1d4 rounds. result as [stunned] for
nonliving creatures.)

   _7 to 12_: [Stunned] for 1d4 rounds, then _[confused]_for an
additional 1d4 rounds.

   _13 or more_:_[Confused]_for 1d4 rounds.

   Sightless creatures are not affected by _scintillating pattern_.

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* one or more rays

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one
ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a
maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch
attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be
fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at
targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

   *Duration* 24 hours

   *Saving Throw* none or [Will] disbelief (if interacted with); see
text; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell creates a powerful protection from scrying and
observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not
be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in
general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed.
Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you
with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion
created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal
illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering
the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save,
assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those
affected by the illusion.

   You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds
on a [Will] save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends
on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical
connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the
subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its [Will] save.

   *You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of
which you have no knowledge.

   If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its
surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).
If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.

   As with all divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full
visual acuity, including any magical effects. In addition, the
following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through
the sensor: _[detect chaos]_, _[detect evil]_, _[detect good]_,
_[detect law]_, _[detect magic]_, and _[message]_.

   If the save succeeds, you can't attempt to scry on that subject
again for at least 24 hours.

   *Scrying, Greater*

   *School* divination (scrying); *Level* bard 6, cleric 7, druid 7,
sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Duration* 1 hour/level

   This spell functions like _[scrying]_, except as noted above.
Additionally, all of the following spells function reliably through the
sensor: _[detect chaos]_, _[detect evil]_, _[detect good]_, _[detect
law]_, _[detect magic]_, _[message]_, _[read magic]_, and _[tongues]_.

   Sculpt Sound

   *Sculpt Sound*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature or object/level, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   You can change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can
create sounds where none exist, deaden sounds, or transform sounds into
other sounds. All affected creatures or objects must be transmuted in
the same way. Once the transmutation is made, you cannot change it. You
can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words with which
you are unfamiliar yourself.

   A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically is unable to cast
spells with verbal components.

   Searing Light

   *Searing Light*

   *School* evocation; *Level* cleric 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* ray

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   Focusing divine power like a ray of the sun, you project a blast of
light from your open palm. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to
strike your target. A creature struck by this ray of light takes 1d8
points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead
creature takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6),
and an undead creature particularly vulnerable to bright light takes
1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). A construct or
inanimate object takes only 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels
(maximum 5d6).

   Secret Chest

   *Secret Chest*

   *School* conjuration (summoning); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, F (the chest and its replica)

   *Range* see text

   *Target* one chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level

   *Duration* 60 days or until discharged

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as 60 days and
can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of
material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which
is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in
the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the
chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard
action), and it appears next to you.

   The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive,
constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is
never less than 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny
replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail) so that the
miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs
50 gp.) The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted with locks, wards,
and so on, just as any normal chest can be.

   To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest
and the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need
the replica to recall the chest. After 60 days, there is a cumulative
chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the
miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, even with
a _[wish]_spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an
extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.

   Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they
die if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to
survive.

   Secret Page

   *Secret Page*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (powdered herring scales and a vial of
will-o'-wisp essence)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* page touched, up to 3 sq. ft. in size

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   S_ecret page_alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be
something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to
show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This
spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it
can be used to hide a scroll. _[Explosive runes]_or _[sepia snake
sigil]_can be cast upon the _secret page._

   A _[comprehend languages]_spell alone cannot reveal a _secret
page_'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by
speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return
it to its _secret page_form at will. You can also remove the spell by
double repetition of the special word. A _[detect magic]_spell reveals
dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true
contents. _[True seeing]_reveals the presence of the hidden material
but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with
_[comprehend languages]._A _secret page_spell can be dispelled, and the
hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an _erase_spell.

   Secure Shelter

   *Secure Shelter*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (a chip of stone, sand, a drop of water, and a
wood splinter)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* 20-ft.-square structure

   *Duration* 2 hours/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is
common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean,
and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door,
two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.

   The shelter must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat
adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however,
provide considerable security otherwise--it is as strong as a normal
stone building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling
resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to normal
missiles (but not the sort cast by siege engines or giants).

   The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against intrusion,
the former two being secured with _[arcane lock]_and the latter by an
iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In addition, these three areas
are protected by an _alarm_spell. Finally, an _unseen servant_is
conjured to provide service to you for the duration of the shelter.

   The _secure shelter_contains crude furnishings--eight bunks, a
trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.

   See Invisibility

   *See Invisibility*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (talc and powdered silver)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 10 min./level (D)

   You can see any objects or beings that are [invisible] within your
range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were
normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent
shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible,
[invisible], and ethereal creatures.

   The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It
does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects.
It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or
otherwise hard to see.

   _See invisibility_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell.

   Seeming

   *Seeming*

   *School* illusion (glamer); *Level* bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

   *Duration* 12 hours (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates or [Will] disbelief (if interacted
with); **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes or no; see text

   This spell functions like _[disguise self]_, except that you can
change the appearance of other people as well. Affected creatures
resume their normal appearances if slain. Unwilling targets can negate
the spell's effect on them by making [Will] saves or with [spell
resistance].

   Sending

   *Sending*

   *School* evocation; *Level* cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (fine copper wire)

   *Range* see text

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* 1 round; see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and
send a short message of 25 words or less to the subject. The subject
recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner
immediately. A creature with an [Intelligence] score as low as 1 can
understand the _sending,_though the subject's ability to react is
limited as normal by its [Intelligence]. Even if the _sending_is
received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

   If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as
you are, there is a 5% chance that the _sending_does not arrive. (Local
conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

   Sepia Snake Sigil

   *Sepia Snake Sigil*

   *School* conjuration (creation) [force]; *Level* bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (powdered amber worth 500 gp and a snake scale)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one touched book or written work

   *Duration* permanent or until discharged; until released or 1d4 days
+ 1 day/level; see text

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   You cause a small symbol to appear in the text of a written work.
The text containing the symbol must be at least 25 words long. When
anyone reads the text containing the symbol, the _sepia snake
sigil_springs into being, transforming into a large sepia serpent that
strikes at the reader, provided there is line of effect between the
symbol and the reader.

   Simply seeing the enspelled text is not sufficient to trigger the
spell; the subject must deliberately read it. The target is entitled to
a save to evade the snake's strike. If it succeeds, the _sepia
snake_dissipates in a flash of brown light accompanied by a puff of
dun-colored smoke and a loud noise. If the target fails its save, it is
engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force and immobilized until
released, either at your command or when 1d4 days + 1 day per caster
level have elapsed.

   While trapped in the amber field of force, the subject does not age,
breathe, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells. It is preserved in a
state of suspended animation, unaware of its surroundings. It can be
damaged by outside forces (and perhaps even killed), since the field
provides no protection against physical injury. However, a [dying]
subject does not lose hit points or become [stable] until the spell
ends.

   The hidden sigil cannot be detected by normal observation, and
_[detect magic]_reveals only that the entire text is magical.

   A _[dispel magic]_can remove the sigil. An _erase_spell destroys the
entire page of text.

   _Sepia snake sigil_can be cast in combination with other spells that
hide or garble text, such as _[secret page]._

   Sequester

   *Sequester*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a basilisk eyelash and gum arabic)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one willing creature or object (up to a 2-ft. cube/level)
touched

   *Duration* 1 day/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none or [Will] negates (object); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no or yes (object)

   When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or
locating the target and also renders the affected target [invisible]
(as the _[invisibility]_spell). The spell does not prevent the subject
from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of
devices. Creatures affected by _sequester_become comatose and are
effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

   _Note_: The [Will] save prevents an attended or magical object from
being _sequestered._There is no save to see the _sequestered_creature
or object or to detect it with a divination spell.

   Shades

   *Shades*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 9

   This spell functions like _[shadow conjuration],_except that it
mimics conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory
conjurations created deal four-fifths (80%) damage to nonbelievers, and
nondamaging effects are 80% likely to work against nonbelievers.

   Shadow Conjuration

   *Shadow Conjuration*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* see text

   *Effect* see text

   *Duration* see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see
text; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes; see text

   You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real
illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. _Shadow
conjuration_can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or
conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower.

   _Shadow conjurations_are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real
things, though creatures who believe the _shadow conjurations_to be
real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts
with the spell can make a [Will] save to recognize its true nature.

   Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected
creature succeeds on a [Will] save. Each disbelieving creature takes
only one-fifth (20%) damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack
has a special effect other than damage, that effect is only 20% likely
to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an
affected creature is also allowed any save that the spell being
simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to _shadow
conjuration_'s level (4th) rather than the spell's normal level. In
addition, any effect created by _shadow conjuration_allows [spell
resistance], even if the spell it is simulating does not. Shadow
objects or substances have normal effects except against those who
disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are 20% likely to work.

   A shadow creature has one-fifth the hit points of a normal creature
of its kind (regardless of whether it's recognized as shadowy). It
deals normal damage and has all normal abilities and weaknesses.
Against a creature that recognizes it as a shadow creature, however,
the shadow creature's damage is one-fifth (20%) normal, and all special
abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 20% likely to work.
(Roll for each use and each affected character separately.)
Furthermore, the shadow creature's [AC] bonuses are just one-fifth as
large.

   A creature that succeeds on its save sees the _shadow
conjurations_as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy
forms. Objects automatically succeed on their [Will] saves against this
spell.

   *Shadow Conjuration, Greater*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   This spell functions like _[shadow conjuration],_except that it
duplicates any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or
conjuration (creation) spell of 6th level or lower. The illusory
conjurations created deal three-fifths (60%) damage to nonbelievers,
and nondamaging effects are 60% likely to work against nonbelievers.

   Shadow Evocation

   *Shadow Evocation*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* see text

   *Effect* see text

   *Duration* see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real,
illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level
or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an
affected creature succeeds on a [Will] save. Each disbelieving creature
takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack
has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as
strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a
_shadow evocation,_a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage.
Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected
creature is also allowed any save (or [spell resistance]) that the
spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to
_shadow evocation'_s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.

   Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who
disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.

   Objects automatically succeed on their [Will] saves against this
spell.

   *Shadow Evocation, Greater*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 8

   This spell functions like _[shadow evocation],_except that it
enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of sorcerer or
wizard evocation spells of 7th level or lower. If recognized as a
_greater shadow evocation_, a damaging spell deals only three-fifths
(60%) damage.

   Shadow Walk

   *Shadow Walk*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* up to one touched creature/level

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   To use the _shadow walk_spell, you must be in an area of dim light.
You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling
path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders
the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is
quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject
to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.

   In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour,
moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more
rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to
travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired
distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.

   Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and
the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas
you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your
travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making
the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when
the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10 × 100 feet in a random
horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place
you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10 × 1,000 feet in the
same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object,
you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space
available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature
[fatigued] (no save).

   _Shadow walk_can also be used to travel to other planes that border
on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the
Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality.
The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.

   Any creatures touched by you when _shadow walk_is cast also make the
transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.

   They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble
back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter
results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to
accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a [Will] saving throw,
negating the effect if successful.

   Shambler

   *Shambler*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* druid 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* three or more shambling mounds, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart; see text

   *Duration* 7 days or 7 months (D); see text

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   The _shambler_spell creates 1d4+2 shambling mounds with the advanced
template. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform
a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with
you for 7 days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created
only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is 7 months. In
this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site
or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the
spell's range, which is measured from the point where each first
appeared. You can only have one _shambler_ spell in effect at one time.
If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the
previous casting is dispelled. The shamblers have resistance to fire as
normal shambling mounds do only if the terrain where they are summoned
is rainy, marshy, or damp.

   Shapechange

   *Shapechange*

   *School*transmutation (polymorph); *Level*druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S, F (jade circlet worth 1,500 gp)

   *Range*personal

   *Target*you

   *Duration*10 min./level (D)

   This spell allows you to take the form of a wide variety of
creatures. This spell can function as _[alter self], [beast shape IV],
[elemental body IV], [form of the dragon III], [giant form II],_and
_[plant shape III]_ depending on what form you take. You can change
form once each round as a free action. The change takes place either
immediately before your regular action or immediately after it, but not
during the action.

   Shatter

   *Shatter*

   *School* evocation [sonic]; *Level* bard 2, cleric 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a chip of mica)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area or Target* 5-ft.-radius spread; or one solid object or one
crystalline creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); [Will] negates (object) or
[Fortitude] half; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   _Shatter_creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle,
nonmagical objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or
damages a crystalline creature.

   Used as an area attack, _shatter_destroys nonmagical objects of
crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such unattended objects
within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens
of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your
level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate
composition are shattered.

   Alternatively, you can target _shatter_against a single solid
nonmagical object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds
per caster level. Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any
weight), _shatter_deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level
(maximum 10d6), with a [Fortitude] save for half damage.

   Shield

   *Shield*

   *School* abjuration [force]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   _Shield_creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of
you. It negates _[magic missile]_attacks directed at you. The disk also
provides a +4 shield bonus to [AC]. This bonus applies against
[incorporeal] touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The
_shield_has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

   Shield of Faith

   *Shield of Faith*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (parchment with a holy text written on it)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the target
that averts and deflects attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2
deflection bonus to [AC], with an additional +1 to the bonus for every
six levels you have (maximum +5 deflection bonus at 18th level).

   Shield of Law

   *Shield of Law*

   *School* abjuration [lawful]; *Level* cleric 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a reliquary worth 500 gp)

   *Range* 20 ft.

   *Targets* one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from
attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures,
and _slowing_chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This
abjuration has four effects.

   First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC] and
a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _[protection from chaos]_, this
benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by
chaotic creatures.

   Second, a warded creature gains [spell resistance] 25 against
chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

   Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental
influence, just as _[protection from chaos]_does.

   Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a
warded creature, the attacker is _slowed_([Will] save negates, as the
_[slow]_spell, but against _shield of law_'s save DC).

   Shield Other

   *Shield Other*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 2, paladin 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a pair of platinum rings worth 50 gp worn by
both you and the target)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one creature

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between
you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you.
The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to [AC] and a +1 resistance
bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from
all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities)
that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the
warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit
points, such as _charm_effects, temporary ability damage, level
draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a
reduction of hit points from a lowered [Constitution] score, the
reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage.
When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the
subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the
subject.

   If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other,
the spell ends.

   Shillelagh

   *Shillelagh*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one touched nonmagical oak club or quarterstaff

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   Your own nonmagical club or quarterstaff becomes a weapon with a +1
enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A quarterstaff gains this
enhancement for both ends of the weapon. It deals damage as if it were
two size categories larger (a Small club or quarterstaff so transmuted
deals 1d8 points of damage, a Medium 2d6, and a Large 3d6), +1 for its
enhancement bonus. These effects only occur when the weapon is wielded
by you. If you do not wield it, the weapon behaves as if unaffected by
this spell.

   Shocking Grasp

   *Shocking Grasp*

   *School* evocation [electricity]; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature or object touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity
damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you
gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor
(or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

   Shout

   *Shout*

   *School* evocation [sonic]; *Level* bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V

   *Range* 30 ft.

   *Area* cone-shaped burst

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial or [Reflex] negates (object); see
text; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in
its path. Any creature within the area is [deafened] for 2d6 rounds and
takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the
deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or
crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic
damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed
a [Fortitude] save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding
fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful [Reflex]
save. A _shout_spell cannot penetrate a _[silence]_spell.

   *Shout, Greater*

   *School* evocation [sonic]; *Level* bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Components*: V, S, F (a metal or ivory horn)

   *Range* 60 ft.

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial or [Reflex] negates (object); see
text

   This spell functions like _[shout],_except that the cone deals 10d6
points of sonic damage (or 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level,
maximum 20d6, against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or
crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be [stunned] for 1
round and [deafened] for 4d6 rounds. A creature in the area of the cone
can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and the duration of
the deafness with a successful [Fortitude] save. A creature holding
vulnerable objects can attempt a [Reflex] save to negate the damage to
those objects.

   Shrink Item

   *Shrink Item*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one touched object of up to 2 cu. ft./level

   *Duration* 1 day/level; see text

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size
limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000
the original volume and mass). This change effectively reduces the
object's size by four categories. Optionally, you can also change its
now shrunken composition to a clothlike one. Objects changed by a
_shrink item_spell can be returned to normal composition and size
merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command
from the original caster. Even a burning fire and its fuel can be
shrunk by this spell. Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size
and composition ends the spell.

   _Shrink item_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell, in
which case the affected object can be shrunk and expanded an indefinite
number of times, but only by the original caster.

   Silence

   *Silence*

   *School*illusion (glamer); *Level*bard 2, cleric 2

   *Casting Time*1 round

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area*20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object, or
point in space

   *Duration*1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*: [Will] negates; see text or none (object); **note
Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.*: yes; see text or no (object)

   Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the
affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells
with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues
from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a
point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile
object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then
radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature
can attempt a [Will] save to negate the spell and can use [spell
resistance], if any. Items in a creature's possession or magic items
that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and [spell resistance],
but unattended objects and points in space do not. Creatures in an area
of a _silence_spell are immune to sonic or language-based attacks,
spells, and effects.

   Silent Image

   *Silent Image*

   *School* illusion (figment); *Level* bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (a bit of fleece)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Effect* visual figment that cannot extend beyond four 10-ft. cubes
+ one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

   *Duration* concentration

   *Saving Throw*[Will] disbelief (if interacted with); **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or
force, as visualized by you. The illusion does not create sound, smell,
texture, or temperature. You can move the image within the limits of
the size of the effect.

   Simulacrum

   *Simulacrum*

   *School* illusion (shadow); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 12 hours

   *Components* V, S, M (ice sculpture of the target plus powdered
rubies worth 500 gp per HD of the simulacrum)

   *Range* 0 ft.

   *Effect* one duplicate creature

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   _Simulacrum_creates an illusory duplicate of any creature. The
duplicate creature is partially real and formed from ice or snow. It
appears to be the same as the original, but it has only half of the
real creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats,
skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD).
You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed
twice your caster level. You must make a Disguise check when you cast
the spell to determine how good the likeness is. A creature familiar
with the original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception
check (opposed by the caster's Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive
check.

   At all times, the simulacrum remains under your absolute command. No
special telepathic link exists, so command must be exercised in some
other manner. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It
cannot increase its level or abilities. If reduced to 0 hit points or
otherwise destroyed, it reverts to snow and melts instantly into
nothingness. A complex process requiring at least 24 hours, 100 gp per
hit point, and a fully equipped magical laboratory can repair damage to
a simulacrum.

   Slay Living

   *Slay Living*

   *School* necromancy [death]; *Level* cleric 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Target* living creature touched

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You can attempt to slay any one living creature. When you cast this
spell, your hand seethes with eerie dark fire. You must succeed on a
melee touch attack to touch the target. The target takes 12d6 points of
damage + 1 point per caster level. If the target's [Fortitude] saving
throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per
caster level. The subject might die from damage even if it succeeds on
its saving throw.

   Sleep

   *Sleep*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, M (fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* one or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   A _sleep_spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 HD of
creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among
creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of
origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a
creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are [helpless]. Slapping or
wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid
another action). _Sleep_does not target [unconscious] creatures,
constructs, or undead creatures.

   Sleet Storm

   *Sleet Storm*

   *School* conjuration (creation) [cold]; *Level* druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (dust and water)

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Area* cylinder (40-ft. radius, 20 ft. high)

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   Driving sleet blocks all sight (even [darkvision]) within it and
causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or
through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics
check. Failure means it can't move in that round, while failure by 5 or
more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details).

   The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

   Slow

   *Slow*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate.
Creatures affected by this spell are [staggered] and can take only a
single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may
it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on
attack rolls, [AC], and [Reflex] saves. A _slowed_creature moves at
half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which
affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

   Multiple _slow_effects don't stack. _Slow_counters and dispels
_[haste]_.

   Snare

   *Snare*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 3, ranger 2

   *Casting Time* 3 rounds

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* touched nonmagical circle of vine, rope, or thong with a 2
ft. diameter + 2 ft./level

   *Duration* Until triggered or broken

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic
trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope.
When you cast _snare_upon it, the cordlike object blends with its
surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the
trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop
that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping
inside the circle.

   If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to
it. The spell causes the tree to bend, straightening when the loop is
triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and
lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree
is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing
no damage but causing it to be [entangled].

   The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC
23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 [Strength] check that is a full-round
action. The snare has [AC] 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from
the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.

   Soften Earth and Stone

   *Soften Earth and Stone*

   *School* transmutation [earth]; *Level* druid 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area* 10-ft. square/level; see text

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in
the spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth
becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily
molded or chopped. You affect a 10-foot square area to a depth of 1 to
4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that
spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.
Earth or stone creatures are not affected.

   A creature in mud must succeed on a [Reflex] save or be caught for
1d2 rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that
succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it
can't run or charge. Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all
creatures in the area can move at only half their normal speed and
can't run or charge over the surface. Stone softened into clay does not
hinder movement, but it does allow characters to cut, shape, or
excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before.

   While this spell does not affect dressed or worked stone, cavern
ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be affected.
Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened
material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and falls (treat
as a cave-in with no bury zone, see [Environment]).

   A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a
manufactured structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it
to settle. However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by
this spell, not destroyed.

   Solid Fog

   *Solid Fog*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Components*: V, S, M (powdered peas and an animal hoof)

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell functions like _[fog cloud]_, but in addition to
obscuring sight, the _solid fog_ is so thick that it impedes movement.
Creatures moving through a _solid fog_ move at half their normal speed
and take a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The
vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays
and the like). A creature or object that falls into _solid fog_ is
slowed so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces the
falling damage by 1d6. A creature cannot take a 5-foot-step while in
_solid fog_. _Solid fog_, and effects that work like _solid fog_, do
not stack with each other in terms of slowed movement and attack
penalties.

   Unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these
vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

   _Solid fog_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell. A
permanent _solid fog_dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

   Song of Discord

   *Song of Discord*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting, sonic]; *Level*
bard 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* creatures within a 20-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather
than attack their foes. Each affected creature has a 50% chance to
attack the nearest target each round. (Roll to determine each
creature's behavior every round at the beginning of its turn.) A
creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act
normally for that round. Creatures forced by a _song of discord_to
attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing
their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do
not, however, harm targets that have fallen [unconscious].

   Soul Bind

   *Soul Bind*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F (see text)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* corpse

   *Duration* permanent

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   You draw the soul from a newly dead body and imprison it in a black
sapphire gem. The subject must have been dead no more than 1 round per
caster level. The soul, once trapped in the gem, cannot be returned
through _[clone], [raise dead], reincarnation, [resurrection], [true
resurrection],_or even a _[miracle]_or a _[wish]._Only by destroying
the gem or dispelling the spell on the gem can one free the soul (which
is then still dead).

   The focus for this spell is a black sapphire of at least 1,000 gp
value for every HD possessed by the creature whose soul is to be bound.
If the gem is not valuable enough, it shatters when the binding is
attempted. (While creatures have no concept of level or HD as such, the
value of the gem needed to trap an individual can be researched.)

   Sound Burst

   *Sound Burst*

   *School* evocation [sonic]; *Level* bard 2, cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a musical instrument)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Area* 10-ft.-radius spread

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You blast an area with a tremendous cacophony. Every creature in the
area takes 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed on a [Fortitude]
save to avoid being [stunned] for 1 round. Creatures that cannot hear
are not [stunned] but are still damaged.

   Speak with Animals

   *Speak with Animals*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 3, druid 1, ranger 1

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the
spell doesn't make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning
animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones
make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do
some favor or service for you.

   Speak with Dead

   *Speak with Dead*

   *School* necromancy [language-dependent]; *Level* cleric 3

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 10 ft.

   *Target* one dead creature

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* no

   You grant the semblance of life to a corpse, allowing it to answer
questions. You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse's
knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the
languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive,
especially if the creature would have opposed you in life.

   If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the
corpse gets a [Will] save to resist the spell as if it were alive. If
successful, the corpse can refuse to answer your questions or attempt
to deceive you, using Bluff. The soul can only speak about what it knew
in life. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that
occurred after its death.

   If the corpse has been subject to _speak with dead_within the past
week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has
been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly
intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give
partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have
a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell does not affect a corpse
that has been turned into an undead creature.

   Speak with Plants

   *Speak with Plants*

   *School* divination; *Level* bard 4, druid 3, ranger 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   You can communicate with normal plants and plant creatures, and can
ask questions of and receive answers from them. A normal plant's sense
of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or
recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about
events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant
creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore,
wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive,
while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature
is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you.

   Spectral Hand

   *Spectral Hand*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* one spectral hand

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   A ghostly hand shaped from your life force materializes and moves as
you desire, allowing you to deliver low-level, touch range spells at a
distance. On casting the spell, you lose 1d4 hit points that return
when the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is
destroyed. (The hit points can be healed as normal.) For as long as the
spell lasts, any touch range spell of 4th level or lower that you cast
can be delivered by the _spectral hand_. The spell gives you a +2 bonus
on your melee touch attack roll, and attacking with the hand counts
normally as an attack. The hand always strikes from your direction. The
hand cannot flank targets like a creature can. After it delivers a
spell, or if it goes beyond the spell range or goes out of your sight,
the hand returns to you and hovers.

   The hand is [incorporeal] and thus cannot be harmed by normal
weapons. It has improved evasion (half damage on a failed [Reflex] save
and no damage on a successful save), your save bonuses, and an [AC] of
22 (+8 size, +4 natural armor). Your [Intelligence] modifier applies to
the hand's [AC] as if it were the hand's [Dexterity] modifier. The hand
has 1 to 4 hit points, the same number that you lost in creating it.

   Spell Immunity

   *Spell Immunity*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell
for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or
lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable [spell
resistance] regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that
immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which [spell
resistance] doesn't apply. _Spell immunity_protects against spells,
spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of
creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary
abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.

   Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain
domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in
effect. A creature can have only one _spell immunity_or _greater spell
immunity_spell in effect on it at a time.

   *Spell Immunity, Greater*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 8

   This spell functions like _[spell immunity]_, except the immunity
applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A creature can have only one
_[spell immunity]_or _greater spell immunity_spell in effect on it at a
time.

   Spell Resistance

   *Spell Resistance*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* cleric 5

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The target gains [spell resistance] equal to 12 + your caster level.

   Spellstaff

   *Spellstaff*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 6

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, F (the staff that stores the spell)

   *Range* touch

   *Target*wooden quarterstaff touched

   *Duration* permanent until discharged (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (object); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (object)

   You store one spell that you can normally cast in a wooden
quarterstaff. Only one such spell can be stored in a staff at a given
time, and you cannot have more than one _spellstaff_at any given time.
You can cast a spell stored within a staff just as though it were among
those you had prepared, but it does not count against your normal
allotment for a given day. You use up any applicable material
components required to cast the spell when you store it in the
_spellstaff._

   Spell Turning

   *Spell Turning*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a small silver mirror)

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* until expended or 10 min./level

   Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon
the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as
a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. _Spell turning_also
fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell
levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.

   When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of
spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract
the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming
spell, then divide the result by the spell level of the incoming spell
to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells,
you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage. For nondamaging
spells, each of you has a proportional chance to be the one who is
affected. If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by _spell
turning_effects in operation, a resonating field is created. Roll
randomly to determine the result.

d%       Effect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
01-70    Spell drains away without effect.
71-80    Spell affects both of you equally at full effect.
81-97    Both turning effects are rendered nonfunctional for 1d4 minutes.
98-100   Both of you go through a rift into another plane.

   Spider Climb

   *Spider Climb*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a live spider)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even
traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must
have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb
speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks;
furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or
horizontal surface (even upside down). A _spider climbing_creature
retains its [Dexterity] bonus to *note Armor Class: #armor-class. (if
any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their
attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while
climbing.

   Spike Growth

   *Spike Growth*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* druid 3, ranger 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* one 20-ft. square/level

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard
and sharply pointed without changing its appearance.

   In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way.
Typically, _spike growth_can be cast in any outdoor setting except open
water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone. Any creature
moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of
piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

   Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on
a [Reflex] save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its
land speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the
injured creature receives a _cure_spell (which also restores lost hit
points). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes
to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the
spell's save DC.

   Magic traps are hard to detect. A rogue (only) can use the
Perception skill to find a _spike growth_. The DC is 25 + spell level,
or DC 28 for _spike growth_(or DC 27 for _spike growth_cast by a
ranger)._Spike growth_can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

   Spike Stones

   *Spike Stones*

   *School* transmutation [earth]; *Level* druid 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Area* one 20-ft. square/level

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] partial; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves
into long, sharp points that blend into the background.

   _Spike stones_impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any
creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half
speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8
points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the
spiked area.

   Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed on
a [Reflex] save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save
causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 24 hours
or until the injured creature receives a _cure_spell (which also
restores lost hit points). Another character can remove the penalty by
taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Heal check
against the spell's save DC.

   Magic traps such as _spike stones_are hard to detect. A rogue (only)
can use the Perception skill to find _spike stones_. The DC is 25 +
spell level, or DC 29 for _spike stones_._Spike stones_is a magic trap
that can't be disabled with the Disable Device skill.

   Spiritual Weapon

   *Spiritual Weapon*

   *School* evocation [force]; *Level* cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect*magic weapon of force

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as
you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three
caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of
a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual
significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat
range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes
the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the
spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It
uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per
round in subsequent rounds) plus your [Wisdom] modifier as its attack
bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can
damage creatures that have [damage reduction]. As a force effect, it
can strike [incorporeal] creatures without the reduction in damage
associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your
direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get
one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the
weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if
you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.

   Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect
the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to
attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon
switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking
that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base
attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the _spiritual weapon_is a
ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range
increment, and switching targets still is a move action.

   A _spiritual weapon_cannot be attacked or harmed by physical
attacks, but _[dispel magic]_, _[disintegrate]_, a _[sphere of
annihilation]_, or a _[rod of cancellation]_affects it. A _spiritual
weapon_'s [AC] against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny
object).

   If an attacked creature has [spell resistance], you make a caster
level check (1d20 + caster level) against that [spell resistance] the
first time the _spiritual weapon_strikes it. If the weapon is
successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has
its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

   The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own
personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his
alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a _spiritual
weapon_of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in
accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with
each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail),
good (warhammer), law (longsword).

   Stabilize

   *Stabilize*

   *School*conjuration (healing); *Level*cleric 0, druid 0

   *Casting Time*1 standard action

   *Components*V, S

   *Range*close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration*instantaneous

   *Saving Throw*: [Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.*: yes (harmless)

   Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has -1 or
fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does
not lose any further hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it
continues [dying] normally.

   Statue

   *Statue*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, M (lime, sand, and a drop of water stirred by an
iron spike)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 1 hour/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   A _statue_spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any
garments and equipment worn or carried. In statue form, the subject
gains hardness 8. The subject retains its own hit points. The subject
can see, hear, and smell normally, but it does not need to eat or
breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the
granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a
mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms constitutes
serious damage. The subject of a _statue_spell can return to its normal
state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free
action) if it so desires as long as the spell duration is in effect.

   Status

   *Status*

   *School* divination; *Level* cleric 2

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* touch

   *Targets* one living creature touched per three levels

   *Duration* 1 hour/level

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   When you need to keep track of comrades who may get separated,
_status_allows you to mentally monitor their relative positions and
general condition. You are aware of direction and distance to the
creatures and any conditions affecting them: unharmed, wounded,
[disabled], [staggered], [unconscious], [dying], [nauseated],
[panicked], [stunned], poisoned, [diseased], [confused]_,_or the like.
Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between
them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on
the same plane of existence. If a subject leaves the plane, or if it
dies, the spell ceases to function for it.

   Stinking Cloud

   *Stinking Cloud*

   *School* conjuration (creation); *Level* sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a rotten egg or cabbage leaves)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Effect* cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

   *Duration* 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   _Stinking cloud_creates a bank of fog like that created by _[fog
cloud]_, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the
cloud become [nauseated]. This condition lasts as long as the creature
is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately
for each [nauseated] character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save
but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.
This is a poison effect.

   _Stinking cloud_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell. A
permanent _stinking cloud_dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

   Stone Shape

   *Stone Shape*

   *School* transmutation [earth]; *Level* cleric 3, druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (soft clay)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* stone or stone object touched, up to 10 cu. ft. + 1 cu.
ft./level

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You can form an existing piece of stone into any shape that suits
your purpose. While it's possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so
forth with _stone shape,_fine detail isn't possible. There is a 30%
chance that any shape including moving parts simply doesn't work.

   Stoneskin

   *Stoneskin*

   *School* abjuration; *Level* druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (granite and diamond dust worth 250 gp)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* creature touched

   *Duration* 10 min./level or until discharged

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates (harmless); **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes (harmless)

   The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and
slashes. The subject gains [DR] 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10
points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an
adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented
a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points),
it is discharged.

   Stone Tell

   *Stone Tell*

   *School* divination; *Level* druid 6

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* personal

   *Target* you

   *Duration* 1 min./level

   You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you who
or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered or
concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete descriptions
if asked. A stone's perspective, perception, and knowledge may prevent
the stone from providing the details you are looking for. You can speak
with natural or worked stone.

   Stone to Flesh

   *Stone to Flesh*

   *School* transmutation; *Level* sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Target* one [petrified] creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft.
to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long

   *Duration* instantaneous

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates (object); see text; **note Spell
Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell restores a [petrified] creature to its normal state,
restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 [Fortitude]
save to survive the process. Any [petrified] creature, regardless of
size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into
a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force
unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this
spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh
statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in
the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a
cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a
cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

   Storm of Vengeance

   *Storm of Vengeance*

   *School* conjuration (summoning); *Level* cleric 9, druid 9

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

   *Effect* 360-ft.-radius storm cloud

   *Duration* concentration (maximum 10 rounds) (D)

   *Saving Throw* see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You create a huge black storm cloud in the air. Each creature under
the cloud must succeed on a [Fortitude] save or be [deafened] for 1d4 ×
10 minutes. Each round you continue to concentrate, the spell generates
additional effects as noted below. Each effect occurs on your turn.

   _2nd Round_: Acid rains down in the area, dealing 1d6 points of acid
damage (no save).

   _3rd Round_: You call six bolts of lightning down from the cloud.
You decide where the bolts strike. No two bolts may be directed at the
same target. Each bolt deals 10d6 points of electricity damage. A
creature struck can attempt a [Reflex] save for half damage.

   _4th Round_: Hailstones rain down in the area, dealing 5d6 points of
bludgeoning damage (no save).

   _5th through 10th Rounds_: Violent rain and wind gusts reduce
visibility. The rain obscures all sight, including [darkvision], beyond
5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). Speed
is reduced by three-quarters.

   Ranged attacks within the area of the storm are impossible. Spells
cast within the area are disrupted unless the caster succeeds on a
Concentration check against a DC equal to the _storm of vengeance_'s
save DC + the level of the spell the caster is trying to cast.

   Suggestion

   *Suggestion*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one living creature

   *Duration* 1 hour/level or until completed

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a
course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The _suggestion_must
be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable.
Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically
negates the effect of the spell.

   The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire
duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You
can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell
duration expires, the activity is not performed.

   A very reasonable _suggestion_causes the save to be made with a
penalty (such as -1 or -2).

   *Suggestion, Mass*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; *Level* bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Range*medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

   *Targets* one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30
ft. apart

   This spell functions like _[suggestion]_, except that it can affect
more creatures. The same _[suggestion]_applies to all these creatures.

   Summon Instrument

   *Summon Instrument*

   *School* conjuration (summoning); *Level* bard 0

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S

   *Range* 0 ft.

   *Effect* one summoned handheld musical instrument

   *Duration* 1 min./level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell summons one handheld musical instrument of your choice.
This instrument appears in your hands or at your feet (your choice).
The instrument is typical for its type. Only one instrument appears per
casting, and it will play only for you. You can't summon an instrument
too large to be held in two hands. The summoned instrument disappears
at the end of this spell.

   * This creature is summoned with the [celestial template] if you are

   *School* conjuration (summoning) [see text]; *Level* bard 1, cleric
1, sorcerer/wizard 1

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, F/DF (a tiny bag and a small candle)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* one summoned creature

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell summons an extraplanar creature (typically an outsider,
elemental, or magical beast native to another plane). It appears where
you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your
opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the
creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular
enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell conjures one of the
creatures from the 1st Level list on Table 10-1. You choose which kind
of creature to summon, and you can choose a different one each time you
cast the spell.

   A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another
creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support
them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or
spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive material
components (such as _[wish]_).

   When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an
alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. Creatures
on Table 10-1 marked with an “*” are summoned with the celestial
template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil.
If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the
creature. Creatures marked with an “*” always have an alignment that
matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment. Summoning these
creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your alignment.

   *School* conjuration (summoning); *Level* druid 1, ranger 1

   *Casting Time* 1 round

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Effect* one summoned creature

   *Duration* 1 round/level (D)

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   This spell summons to your side a natural creature (typically an
animal, fey, magical beast, outsider with the elemental subtype, or a
giant). The summoned ally appears where you designate and acts
immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its
ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it
not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other
actions as you command.

   A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another
creature, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities.
Creatures cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support
them. Creatures summoned using this spell cannot use spells or
spell-like abilities that duplicate spells that have expensive material
components (such as _[wish]_).

   The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st Level list on
Table 10-2. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you can
change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on
the table are neutral unless otherwise noted.

   When you use a summoning spell to summon a creature with an
alignment or elemental subtype, it is a spell of that type. All
creatures summoned with this spell without alignment subtypes have an
alignment that matches yours, regardless of their usual alignment.
Summoning these creatures makes the summoning spell's type match your
alignment.

   *Components* V, S, M/DF (a square of red cloth)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Duration* concentration + 2 rounds

   *Saving Throw* none; **note Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* no

   You summon a swarm of bats, rats, or spiders (your choice), which

so that it shares the area of other creatures.) If no living creatures
are within its area, the swarm attacks or pursues the nearest creature
as best it can. The caster has no control over its target or direction
of travel.

   Sunbeam

   *Sunbeam*

   *School* evocation [light]; *Level* druid 7

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   *Components* V, S, DF

   *Range* 60 ft.

   *Area* line from your hand

   *Duration* 1 round/level or until all beams are [exhausted]

   *Saving Throw* [Reflex] negates and [Reflex] half; see text; **note
Spell Resistance: #spell-resistance.* yes

   For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action to
evoke a dazzling beam of intense light each round. You can call forth
one beam per three caster levels (maximum six beams at 18th level). The
spell ends when its duration runs out or your allotment of beams is
[exhausted].

   Each creature in the beam is [blinded] and takes 4d6 points of
damage. Any creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take
double damage. A successful [Reflex] save negates the blindness and
reduces the damage by half.

   An undead creature caught within the beam takes 1d6 points of damage
per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a [Reflex] save is
successful. In addition, the beam results in the destruction of any
undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails its
save.

   The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi,
mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.

   Sunburst

   *Sunburst*

   *School* evocation [light]; *Level* druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 standard action

   _Sunburst_causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently
from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are [blinded] and
take 6d6 points of damage. A creature to which sunlight is harmful or
unnatural takes double damage. A successful [Reflex] save negates the
blindness and reduces the damage by half.

   An undead creature caught within the globe takes 1d6 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 25d6), or half damage if a [Reflex]
save is successful. In addition, the burst results in the destruction
of any undead creature specifically harmed by bright light if it fails
its save.

   The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi,
mold, oozes, and slimes just as if they were undead creatures.

   _Sunburst_dispels any darkness spells of lower than 9th level within
its area.

   Symbol of Death

   *Symbol of Death*

   *School* necromancy [death]; *Level* cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth 5,000 gp each)

   *Range* 0 ft.; see text

   *Effect* one symbol

   *Duration* see text

   *Saving Throw* [Fortitude] negates; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a
surface. When triggered, a _symbol of death_kills one or more creatures
within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total
current hit points do not exceed 150. The _symbol of death_affects the
closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to
affect. Once triggered, the _symbol_becomes active and glows, lasting
for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit
points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that
enters the area while the _symbol of death_is active is subject to its
effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was
triggered. A creature need save against the _symbol_only once as long
as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns
while the _symbol_is still active, it must save again.

   Until it is triggered, the _symbol of death_is inactive (though
visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a
_symbol of death_must always be placed in plain sight and in a
prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the _symbol of
death_ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which
case the _symbol of death_works normally.

   As a default, a _symbol of death_is triggered whenever a creature
does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune;
reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes
through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or
methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death
can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering
conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a
_symbol of death_'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.

   In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it,
identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a _symbol of
death_to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to
touch. You can't use a _symbol of death_offensively; for instance, a
touch-triggered _symbol of death_ remains untriggered if an item
bearing the _symbol of death_is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a
_symbol of death_cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when
the weapon strikes a foe.

   You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These
can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for
triggering a _symbol of death_can be based on a creature's name,
identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable
actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit
points don't qualify.

   When scribing a _symbol of death_, you can specify a password or
phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's
effect_._Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular
rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the
rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use
the password again.

   You also can attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of
death,_but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two
creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as
10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large
group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups
takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to
a _symbol of death_cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even
if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically
considered attuned to your own _symbols of death_, and thus always
ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.

   _[Read magic]_allows you to identify a _symbol_with a Spellcraft
check (DC 10 + the _symbol's_spell level). Of course, if the _symbol_is
set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.

   A _symbol of death_can be removed by a successful _[dispel
magic]_targeted solely on the rune. An _erase_spell has no effect on a
_symbol of death._Destruction of the surface where a _symbol of
death_is inscribed destroys the _symbol_but also triggers it.

   _Symbol of death_can be made permanent with a _[permanency]_spell. A
permanent _symbol of death_that is disabled or has affected its maximum
number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be
triggered again as normal.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of death_are hard to detect and
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol
of death_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
spell level, or 33 for _symbol of death_.

   Symbol of Fear

   *Symbol of Fear*

   *School* necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that all
creatures within 60 feet of the _symbol of fear_instead become
[panicked] for 1 round per caster level.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of fear_are hard to detect and
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol
of fear_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
spell level, or 31 for _symbol of fear_.

   Symbol of Insanity

   *Symbol of Insanity*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric
8, sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that all
creatures within the radius of the _symbol of insanity_instead become
permanently insane (as the _[insanity]_spell).

   Unlike _[symbol of death]_, symbol of insanity has no hit point
limit; once triggered, a _symbol of insanity_simply remains active for
10 minutes per caster level.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of insanity_are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a
_symbol of insanity_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each
case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for _symbol of insanity_.

   Symbol of Pain

   *Symbol of Pain*

   *School* necromancy [evil]; *Level* cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that each
creature within the radius of a _symbol of pain_instead suffers
wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks,
and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature
moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

   Unlike _[symbol of death]_, _symbol of pain_has no hit point limit;
once triggered, a _symbol of pain_simply remains active for 10 minutes
per caster level.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of pain_are hard to detect and
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol
of pain_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
spell level, or 30 for _symbol of pain_.

   Symbol of Persuasion

   *Symbol of Persuasion*

   *School* enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that all
creatures within the radius of a _symbol of persuasion_instead become
charmed by the caster (as the _[charm monster]_spell) for 1 hour per
caster level.

   Unlike _[symbol of death]_, _symbol of persuasion_has no hit point
limit; once triggered, a _symbol of persuasion_simply remains active
for 10 minutes per caster level.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of persuasion_are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a
_symbol of persuasion_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each
case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for _symbol of persuasion_.

   Symbol of Sleep

   *Symbol of Sleep*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric
5, sorcerer/wizard 5

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that all
creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the _symbol of
sleep_instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes.
Unlike with the _[sleep]_spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened
by nonmagical means before this time expires.

   Unlike _[symbol of death]_, _symbol of sleep_has no hit point limit;
once triggered, a _symbol of sleep_simply remains active for 10 minutes
per caster level.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of sleep_are hard to detect and
disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a _symbol
of sleep_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 +
spell level, or 30 for _symbol of sleep_.

   Symbol of Stunning

   *Symbol of Stunning*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* cleric
7, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that all
creatures within 60 feet of a _symbol of stunning_instead become
[stunned] for 1d6 rounds.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of stunning_are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a
_symbol of stunning_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each
case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of stunning_.

   Symbol of Weakness

   *Symbol of Weakness*

   *School* necromancy; *Level* cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

   *Components* V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond
and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

   This spell functions like _[symbol of death]_, except that every
creature within 60 feet of a _symbol of weakness_instead suffers
crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of [Strength] damage.

   Unlike _[symbol of death]_, _symbol of weakness_has no hit point
limit; once triggered, a _symbol of weakness_simply remains active for
10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this
symbol once.

   _Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of weakness_are hard to detect
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a
_symbol of weakness_and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each
case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of weakness_.

   Sympathetic Vibration

   *Sympathetic Vibration*

   *School* evocation [sonic]; *Level* bard 6

   *Casting Time* 10 minutes

   *Components* V, S, F (a tuning fork)

   *Range* touch

   *Target* one freestanding structure

   *Duration* up to 1 round/level

   *Saving Throw* none; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   By attuning yourself to a freestanding structure, you can create a
damaging vibration within it. Once it begins, the vibration deals 2d10
points of damage per round to the target structure, bypassing hardness.
You can choose at the time of casting to limit the duration of the
spell; otherwise it lasts for 1 round per level. If the spell is cast
upon a target that is not freestanding, the surrounding stone
dissipates the effect and no damage occurs.

   _Sympathetic vibration_cannot affect creatures (including
constructs). Since a structure is an unattended object, it gets no
saving throw to resist the effect.

   Sympathy

   *Sympathy*

   *School* enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; *Level* druid 9,
sorcerer/wizard 8

   *Casting Time* 1 hour

   *Components* V, S, M (a drop of honey and crushed pearls worth 1,500
gp)

   *Range* close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

   *Target* one location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object

   *Duration* 2 hours/level (D)

   *Saving Throw*[Will] negates; see text; **note Spell Resistance:
#spell-resistance.* yes

   You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that
attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of
a particular alignment, as defined by you. The particular kind of
creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype
is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment must be named.

   Creatures of the specified kind or alignment feel elated and pleased
to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The
compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If
the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment,
but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 × 10 minutes later. If this save
fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.

   _Sympathy_counters and dispels _[antipathy]_.

33 Arcane Archer
****************

Many who seek to perfect the use of the bow sometimes pursue the path
of the arcane archer. Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as
they possess the ability to strike at targets with unerring accuracy
and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane
archers fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike at foes around
corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies that cower
behind such cover. At the height of their power, arcane archers can
fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.

   Those who have trained as both rangers and wizards excel as arcane
archers, although other multiclass combinations are not unheard of.
Arcane archers may be found wherever elves travel, but not all are
allies of the elves. Many, particularly half-elven arcane archers, use
elven traditions solely for their own gain, or worse, against the elves
whose very traditions they adhere to.

   *Role*: Arcane archers deal death from afar, winnowing down
opponents while their allies rush into hand-to-hand combat. With their
capacity to unleash hails of arrows on the enemy, they represent the
pinnacle of ranged combat.

   *Alignment*: Arcane archers can be of any alignment. Elf or half-elf
arcane arches tend to be free-spirited and are rarely lawful.
Similarly, it is uncommon for elven arcane archers to be evil, and
overall the path of the arcane archer is more often pursued by good or
neutral characters.

33.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are class features of the arcane archer prestige
class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: An arcane archer is proficient with
all [simple] and [martial weapons], light armor, medium armor, and
shields.

   *Spells per Day*: At the indicated levels, an arcane archer gains
new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He
does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would
have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he
is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of
spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting
class before becoming an arcane archer, he must decide to which class
he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

   *Enhance Arrows (Su)*: At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an
arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1
enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the
archer need not spend gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an
archer's magic arrows only function for him.

   In addition, the arcane archer's arrows gain a number of additional
qualities as he gains additional levels. The elemental, elemental
burst, and aligned qualities can be changed once per day, when the
arcane archer prepares spells or, in the case of spontaneous
spellcasters, after 8 hours of rest.

   At 3rd level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains
one of the following elemental themed weapon qualities:
_[flaming]_,_[frost]_, or _[shock]_.

   At 5th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains
the _[distance]_ weapon quality.

   At 7th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains
one of the following elemental burst weapon qualities: _[flaming
burst]_, _[icy burst]_, or _[shocking burst]_. This ability replaces
the ability gained at 3rd level.

   At 9th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer gains
one of the following aligned weapon qualities: _[anarchic]_,
_[axiomatic]_, _[holy]_, or _[unholy]_. The arcane archer cannot choose
an ability that is the opposite of his alignment (for example, a lawful
good arcane archer could not choose _[anarchic]_ or _[unholy]_ as his
weapon quality).

   The bonuses granted by a magic bow apply as normal to arrows that
have been enhanced with this ability. Only the larger enhancement bonus
applies. Duplicate abilities do not stack.

   *Imbue Arrow* *(Sp)*: At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the
ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired,
the spell's area is centered where the arrow lands, even if the spell
could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the
archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. A spell
cast in this way uses its standard casting time and the arcane archer
can fire the arrow as part of the casting. The arrow must be fired
during the round that the casting is completed or the spell is wasted.
If the arrow misses, the spell is wasted.

   *Seeker Arrow* *(Sp)*: At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an
arrow at a target known to him within range, and the arrow travels to
the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the
limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability
negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is
rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting
the arrow is part of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability
once per day at 4th level, and one additional time per day for every
two levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of four times per day at 10th level.

   *Phase Arrow* *(Sp)*: At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an
arrow once per day at a target known to him within range, and the arrow
travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any
nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the
arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, armor, and shield
modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this
ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the
action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per day at 6th
level, and one additional time per day for every two levels beyond 6th,
to a maximum of three times per day at 10th level.

   *Hail of Arrows* *(Sp)*: In lieu of his regular attacks, once per
day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each
and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every
arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's
primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single
arrow.

   *Arrow of Death* *(Sp)*: At 10th level, an arcane archer can create
a special type of_[slaying arrow]_that forces the target, if damaged by
the arrow's attack, to make a [Fortitude] save or be slain immediately.
The DC of this save is equal to 20 + the arcane archer's [Charisma]
modifier. It takes 1 day to make a _[slaying arrow]_, and the arrow
only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The _[slaying
arrow]_lasts no longer than 1 year, and the archer can only have one
such arrow in existence at a time.

34 Arcane Trickster
*******************

Few can match the guile and craftiness of arcane tricksters. These
prodigious thieves blend the subtlest aspects of the arcane with the
natural cunning of the bandit and the scoundrel, using spells to
enhance their natural thieving abilities. Arcane tricksters can pick
locks, disarm traps, and lift purses from a safe distance using their
magical legerdemain, and as often as not seek humiliation as a goal to
triumph over their foes than more violent solutions.

   The path to becoming an arcane trickster is a natural progression
for rogues who have supplemented their talents for theft with the study
of the arcane. Multiclass rogue/sorcerers and rogue/bards are the most
common arcane tricksters, although other combinations are possible.
Arcane tricksters are most often found in large, cosmopolitan cities
where their talents for magical larceny can be most effectively put to
use, prowling the streets and stealing from the unwary.

   *Role*: With their mastery of magic, arcane tricksters can make for
even more subtle or confounding opponents than standard rogues. Ranged
legerdemain enhances their skill as thieves, and their ability to make
sneak attacks without[flanking] or as part of a spell can make arcane
tricksters formidable damage-dealers.

   *Alignment*: All arcane tricksters have a penchant for mischief and
thievery, and are therefore never lawful. Although they sometimes
acquire their magical abilities through the studious path of wizardry,
their magical aptitude more often stems from a sorcerous bloodline. As
such, many arcane tricksters are of a chaotic alignment.

34.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are class features of the arcane trickster
prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Arcane tricksters gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

   *Spells per Day*: When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the
character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in
a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class.
She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class
would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known
(if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level
of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class
before becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she
adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

   *Ranged Legerdemain (Su)*: An arcane trickster can use *note Disable
Device: #disable-device. and *note Sleight of Hand: #sleight-of-hand.
at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal skill
check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check.
Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. She can only
use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.

   *Sneak Attack*: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same
name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd,
4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets a [sneak attack]
bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

   *Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex)*: Beginning at 3rd level, once per day
an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack she makes to
be a [sneak attack] (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if
the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an
impromptu sneak attack loses any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], but only
against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but
creatures that are not subject to [critical hit]s take no extra damage
(though they still lose any [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] against the
attack).

   At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.

   *Tricky Spells (Su)*: Starting at 5th level, an arcane trickster can
cast her spells without their somatic or verbal components, as if using
the [Still Spell] and [Silent Spell] feats. Spells cast using this
ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can use
this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional time per
every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per day at 9th
level. The arcane trickster decides to use this ability at the time of
casting.

   *Invisible Thief (Su)*: At 9th level, an arcane trickster can become
[invisible], as if under the effects of _[greater invisibility],_ as a
free action. She can remain [invisible] for a number of rounds per day
equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for this effect
is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not be consecutive.

   *Surprise Spells*: At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add her
sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the targets are
[flat-footed]. This additional damage only applies to spells that deal
hit point damage, and the additional damage is of the same type as the
spell. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or halve the
damage, it also negates or halves the sneak attack damage.

   Assassin

35 Assassin
***********

A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional detachment,
the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty hunting, and
terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan, and his medium is
death. Trained in a variety of killing techniques, assassins are among
the most feared classes.

   While nearly any class is capable of becoming an assassin, rogues
suit the part more than any other, from both an ability viewpoint and
an ideological one. Though they make excellent allies during combat,
assassins excel in more clandestine situations, and the best assassins
are the ones the victims never knew existed.

   *Role*: Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing companions as
liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin's missions put him in the
company of adventurers for long stretches at a time, but few people are
comfortable trusting a professional assassin to watch their backs in a
fight, and are more likely to let the emotionless killer scout ahead or
help prepare ambushes.

   *Alignment*: Due to its necessary selfishness and callous
indifference toward taking lives, the assassin class attracts those
with evil alignments more than any others. Because the profession
requires a degree of self-discipline, chaotic characters are ill suited
to becoming these shadowy killers. Neutral characters sometimes become
assassins, frequently thinking of themselves as simple professionals
performing a job, yet the nature of their duties inevitably pushes them
toward an evil alignment.

File: test.info,  Node: Class Features,  Prev: Class Skills,  Up: Assassin

35.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are class features of the assassin prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Assassins are proficient with the
crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap,
shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are
proficient with light armor but not with shields.

   *Sneak Attack*: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same
name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (1st,
3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). If an assassin gets a [sneak attack] bonus
from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

   *Death Attack (Ex)*: If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds
and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully
deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly
either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). Studying
the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target
detects the assassin or recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although
the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his
[Dexterity] bonus to his *note Armor Class: #armor-class. or
is[flanked]). If the victim of such a death attack fails a [Fortitude]
save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's [Int]
modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails
against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered [helpless] and
unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If
the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak
attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must
make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

   If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save)
or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of
completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can
attempt another death attack.

   *Poison Use*: Assassins are trained in the use of poison and cannot
accidentally poison themselves when applying [poison] to a blade (see
*note Poison: #poison.).

   *Save Bonus against Poison*: At 2nd level, the assassin gains a +1
saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus increase by +1 every two
levels.

   *Uncanny Dodge (Ex)*: At 2nd level, an assassin cannot be caught
[flat-footed], even if the attacker is [invisible]. He still loses his
[Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. An assassin with this ability
can still lose his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent
successfully uses the feint action against him.

   If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he
automatically gains [improved uncanny dodge] instead.

   *Hidden Weapons (Ex)*: At 4th level, an assassin becomes a master at
hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all *note
Sleight of Hand: #sleight-of-hand. skill checks made to prevent others
from noticing them.

   *True Death (Su)*: Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an
assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the
dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead
using _[raise dead]_ or similar magic must make a caster level check
with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails and the
material component is wasted. Casting _[remove curse]_ the round before
attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this
chance. The DC of the _[remove curse]_ is 10 + the assassin's level.

   *Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)*: At 5th level and higher, an assassin
can no longer be[flanked]. This defense denies a [rogue] the ability to
sneak attack the assassin by[flanking] him, unless the attacker has at
least four more [rogue] levels than the target has assassin levels.

   If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the
levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the
minimum [rogue] level required to[flank] the character.

   *Quiet Death (Ex)*: At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a
creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also
make a *note Stealth: #stealth. check, opposed by *note Perception:
#perception. checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from
identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not
even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the
assassin to avoid detection.

   *Hide in Plain Sight (Su)*: At 8th level, an assassin can use the
*note Stealth: #stealth. skill even while being observed. As long as he
is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself
from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind.
He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.

   *Swift Death (Ex)*: At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can make
a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He
must still [sneak attack] his foe using a melee weapon that deals
damage.

   *Angel of Death (Su)*: At 10th level, the assassin becomes a master
of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death
attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This
prevents _[raise dead]_ and _[resurrection]_ (although _[true
resurrection]_ works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of
this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the
target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is
wasted with no effect.

36 Dragon Disciple
******************

As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in
existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting
mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Likewise, the
great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and
alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their
bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs
through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a
sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however,
the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.

   Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to
channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors
who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but
also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their
foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they
can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and--at the
pinnacle of their abilities--assume the form of a dragon. Although they
are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons
interact with mortals.

   *Role*: With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal,
dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering
the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their
opponents. Dragon disciples' draconic abilities, however, make these
versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath
weapons and flight to destroy their foes directly.

   *Alignment*: Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they
tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume
the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red
dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after
the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons,
are often of good alignments.

36.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are class features of the dragon disciple prestige
class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Dragon disciples gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor.

   *Spells per Day*: At the indicated levels, a dragon disciple gains
new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He
does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would
have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he
is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of
spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting
class before becoming a dragon disciple, he must decide to which class
he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

   *Blood of Dragons*: A dragon disciple adds his level to his
[sorcerer] levels when determining the powers gained from his
bloodline. If the dragon disciple does not have levels of [sorcerer],
he instead gains bloodline powers of the [draconic bloodline], using
his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the
bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first
level in this class and that type must be the same as his [sorcerer]
type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a [sorcerer] unless
he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are
automatically granted if the [sorcerer] gains spell slots of the
spell's level.

   *Natural Armor Increase (Ex)*: As his skin thickens, a dragon
disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At
1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the
character's existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on [Table:
Dragon Disciple]. These armor bonuses stack.

   *Ability Boost (Ex)*: As a dragon disciple gains levels in this
prestige class, his ability scores increase as noted on [Table: Dragon
Disciple]. These increases stack and are gained as if through level
advancement.

   *Bloodline Feat*: Upon reaching 2nd level, and every three levels
thereafter, a dragon disciple receives one bonus feat, chosen from the
draconic bloodline's [bonus feat list].

   *Dragon Bite (Ex)*: At 2nd level, whenever the dragon disciple uses
his bloodline to grow claws, he also gains a bite attack. This is a
primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the
dragon disciple is Small), plus 1-1/2 times the dragon disciple's
Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6
points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the
dragon disciple's bloodline.

   *Breath Weapon (Su)*: At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the
breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant
that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through
the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his
breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends
on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple, as detailed
under the [Draconic sorcerer bloodline] description.

   *Blindsense (Ex)*: At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains
[blindsense] with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon
disciple notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make
*note Perception: #perception. checks to notice and pinpoint the
location of creatures within range of his [blindsense] ability,
provided that he has [line of effect] to that creature.

   Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total
concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the normal
miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still
affects the movement of a creature with [blindsense]. A creature with
[blindsense] is still denied its [Dexterity] bonus to *note Armor
Class: #armor-class. against attacks from creatures it cannot see. At
10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.

   *Dragon Form* *(Sp)*: At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the
form of a dragon. This ability works like _[form of the dragon I]_. At
10th level, this ability functions as _[form of the dragon II]_ and the
dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level
for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his
draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts _form of the dragon,_ he must
assume the form of a dragon of the same type as his bloodline.

   *Wings (Su)*: At 9th level, a dragon disciple gains the wings
bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once
his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline,
the dragon disciple's speed increases to 90 feet.

   Duelist

37 Duelist
**********

Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move with a
grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and countering attacks
with swift thrusts of their blades. They may wear armor, but generally
eschew such bulky protection as their grace allows them to dodge their
opponents with ease. While others flounder on treacherous terrain,
duelists charge nimbly across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling
into the fray. They thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade
allows them to make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple
opponents with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.

   The path to the duelist is natural for rogues and bards, as those
classes do not rely on armor for defense, although nearly as many
duelists come from the ranks of fighters and rangers. They are often
found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and etiquette for
battle.

   *Role*: The abilities of duelists complement those rogues or bards
who wish to accentuate their fighting prowess but, because of their
lack of heavy armor, are afraid to leap into combat. Duelists fight in
the forefront alongside fighters, barbarians, and other melee
combatants, deftly avoiding the blades of their opponents while
expertly targeting their vulnerabilities.

   *Alignment*: Duelists can be of any alignment, although since most
hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to eschew lawful
behavior. Lawful duelists are not unheard of, however, and such
duelists often adhere to a strict code of honor, refusing to attack
unarmed or obviously inferior opponents.

37.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are class features of the duelist prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: The duelist is proficient with all
[simple][and][martial weapons]. Duelists are proficient with light
armor but not with shields.

   *Canny Defense (Ex)*: When wearing light or no armor and not using a
shield, a duelist adds 1 point of [Intelligence] bonus (if any) per
duelist class level to her [Dexterity] bonus to modify *note Armor
Class: #armor-class. while wielding a melee weapon. If a duelist is
caught [flat-footed] or otherwise denied her [Dexterity] bonus, she
also loses this bonus.

   *Precise Strike (Ex)*: A duelist gains the ability to strike
precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding her
duelist level to her damage roll.

   When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a weapon
in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise strike only
works against living creatures with discernible anatomies. Any creature
that is immune to [critical hit]s is also immune to a precise strike,
and any item or ability that protects a creature from [critical hit]s
also protects a creature from a precise strike.

   *Improved Reaction (Ex)*: At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2 bonus
on initiative checks. At 8th level, the bonus increases to +4. This
bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the [Improved Initiative]
feat.

   *Parry (Ex)*: At 2nd level, a duelist learns to parry the attacks of
other creatures, causing them to miss. Whenever the duelist takes a
full attack action with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she can
elect not to take one of her attacks. At any time before her next turn,
she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as
an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack
roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during
her previous action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the
attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size
category that the attacking creature is larger than the duelist, the
duelist takes a -4 penalty on her attack roll. The duelist also takes a
-4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent
ally. The duelist must declare the use of this ability after the attack
is announced, but before the roll is made.

   *Enhanced Mobility (Ex)*: Starting at 3rd level, when wearing light
or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an additional +4
bonus to [AC] against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out
of a threatened square.

   *Combat Reflexes*: At 4th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the
[Combat Reflexes] feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon.

   *Grace (Ex)*: At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2
competence bonus on all [Reflex] saving throws. This ability functions
for a duelist only when she is wearing light or no armor and not using
a shield.

   *Riposte (Ex)*: Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an attack
of opportunity against any creature whose attack she successfully
parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is within reach.

   *Acrobatic Charge (Ex)*: At 6th level, a duelist gains the ability
to charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over
difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on the
circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks to
successfully move over the terrain.

   *Elaborate Defense (Ex)*: At 7th level and higher, if a duelist
chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, she
gains an additional +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC] for every 3 levels of
duelist she has attained.

   *Deflect Arrows*: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of the
[Deflect Arrows] feat when using a light or one-handed piercing weapon.
The duelist does not need a free hand to use this feat.

   *No Retreat (Ex)*: At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the duelist
that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from the
duelist.

   *Crippling Critical (Ex)*: When you confirm a [critical hit] using a
light or one-handed piercing weapon, you can apply one of the following
penalties in addition to the damage dealt: reduce all of the target's
speeds by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), 1d4 points of Strength or
[Dexterity] damage, -4 penalty on all saving throws, -4 penalty to
*note Armor Class: #armor-class, or 2d6 points of bleed damage. These
penalties last for 1 minute, except for ability damage, which must be
healed normally, and bleed damage, which continues until the target
receives magic healing or a DC 15 *note Heal: #heal. skill check.

38 Eldritch Knight
******************

Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare among
magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside fighters,
barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must face eldritch
knights in combat fear them greatly, for their versatility on the
battlefield is tremendous; against heavily armed and armored opponents
they may level crippling spells, while opposing spellcasters meet their
ends on an eldritch knight's blade.

   Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both
martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always begin
their paths as multiclassed characters, such as fighter/wizards or
ranger/sorcerers. They may be found wherever studies of the arcane are
as prevalent as martial training.

   *Role*: Eldritch knights blend the abilities of fighting classes and
spellcasters, hurling magic at the enemy one moment and hewing down
their opponents with steel the next. They are just as comfortable
fighting in the thick of combat as they are casting spells at foes
while remaining safely behind their compatriots. Their versatility
makes them valuable allies when the nature of an upcoming battle is
unclear.

   *Alignment*: The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as varied as
the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a career as a
soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any alignment.
Maintaining a balance between studies of arcane lore and martial
techniques requires great discipline, however, and for that reason many
favor lawful alignments.

38.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are features of the eldritch knight prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor.

   *Bonus Feat*: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus
[combat feat]. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any
class normally gets from advancing levels. The character must still
meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats. An eldritch knight gains
an additional [combat feat] at 5th and 9th level.

   *Diverse Training*: An eldritch knight adds his level to any levels
of [fighter] he might have for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites
for feats (if he has no fighter levels, treat his eldritch knight
levels as levels of fighter). He also adds his level to any levels in
an arcane spellcasting class for the purpose of meeting the
prerequisites for feats.

   *Spells per Day*: At the indicated levels, an eldritch knight gains
new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He
does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class
would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known
(if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level
of spellcasting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting
class before becoming an eldritch knight, he must decide to which class
he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

   *Spell Critical (Su)*: At 10th level, whenever an eldritch knight
successfully confirms a [critical hit], he can cast a spell as a swift
action. The spell must include the target of the attack as one of its
targets or in its area of effect. Casting this spell does not provoke
an attack of opportunity. The caster must still meet all of the spell's
components and must roll for arcane spell failure if necessary.

39 Loremaster
*************

The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often
obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore serving as
his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that knowledge is power, the
loremaster often forsakes material wealth and personal glory for rare
or unusual information, an endless quest that brings him ever closer to
his unattainable goal: perfection through edification. Often rejecting
what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of
his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only
worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might. After
all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the body is
limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater with time is
infinite.

   The loremaster class holds little appeal for
non-spellcasters--indeed, before one can devote a life to the studies
and traditions of the loremaster, a character must first master several
spells of the school of divination. Most loremasters begin their paths
as clerics or wizards, but any character capable of casting enough
divination spells can, eventually, become a loremaster.

   *Role*: Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and
fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the loremaster's
reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter oftentimes forces a
loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers who, through a mutually
beneficial arrangement, might provide a degree of protection to the
scholar while he seeks whatever knowledge he is after. For his part,
the loremaster provides a wealth of information and arcane firepower to
a party. Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear
to leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only
old lore can be discovered in books--new lore must be sought out in the
world. These more active loremasters might join up with an adventuring
party for the benefit of the journey, content with whatever knowledge
might be picked up along the way.

   *Alignment*: Most loremasters cannot be bothered with distracting
and pointless philosophies such as ethics, and so tend to be neutral,
neutral good, or neutral evil.

   *Hit Die*: d6.

39.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are Class Features of the loremaster prestige
class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Loremasters gain no proficiency with
any weapon or armor.

   *Spells per Day/Spells Known*: When a new loremaster level is
gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained
a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the
prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character
of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day,
spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased
effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one
spellcasting class before becoming a loremaster, he must decide to
which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells
per day.

   *Secret*: At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st (3rd,
5th, 7th, and 9th), the loremaster chooses one secret from the
Loremaster Secrets table. His level plus [Intelligence] modifier
determines which secrets he can choose. He can't choose the same secret
twice.

about the subject in question.

   Mystic Theurge

40 Mystic Theurge
*****************

Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find
no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the
divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic
in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one
stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power.
No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that
perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral
energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate
and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.

   Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can
already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that they
gain increase their mastery over both.

   *Role*: The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any party,
supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic theurges
travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts, magical lore,
or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with
groups of adventurers so long as that group's goals do not directly
conflict with their own.

   *Alignment*: The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a
sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral
good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral,
or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the
benefit--or control--of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer
still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.

File: test.info,  Node: Class Features,  Prev: Class Skills,  Up: Mystic Theurge

40.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are features of the mystic theurge prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Mystic theurges gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor.

   *Spells per Day*: When a new mystic theurge level is gained, the
character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in
any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the
prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class he belonged to
previously. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of
that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the
level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane
spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has,
then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level
accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class
or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic
theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic
theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.

   *Combined Spells (Su)*: A mystic theurge can prepare and cast spells
from one of his spellcasting classes using the available slots from any
of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way
take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This
ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell
exists on both spell lists. At 1st level, a mystic theurge can prepare
1st-level spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the
2nd-level slots of the other spellcasting class. Every two levels
thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases
by one, to a maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells
would take up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do
not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting
class used to cast the spell.

   Spontaneous spellcasters can only select spells that they have
prepared that day using non-spontaneous classes for this ability, even
if the spells have already been cast. For example, a
cleric/sorcerer/mystic theurge can use this ability to spontaneously
cast a _[bless]_ spell using a 2nd-level sorcerer spell slot, if the
character had a prepared _[bless]_spell using a 1st-level cleric spell
slot, even if that spell had already been cast that day.

   *Spell Synthesis (Su)*: At 10th level, a mystic theurge can cast two
spells, one from each of his spellcasting classes, using one action.
Both of the spells must have the same casting time. The mystic theurge
can make any decisions concerning the spells independently. Any target
affected by both of the spells takes a -2 penalty on saves made against
each spell. The mystic theurge receives a +2 bonus on caster level
checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. A
mystic theurge may use this ability once per day.

41 PF Chronicler
****************

Brave explorers and scavengers of lost or forgotten knowledge, PF
chroniclers are quintessential adventurers, exploring the world for
esoteric truths, magical and mundane relics and artifacts, and new and
mysterious vistas, be they wonderful or terrible. For some, this
journey is purely about the wealth, for others the glory of discovery,
and still more are stirred by the irresistible drive to uncover the
bones of the ages and legends of forgotten epochs in an effort to
chronicle the deeds of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

   The PF chronicler class attracts any who see the world as a great
mystery to be unraveled, and thus has a diverse and varied following,
from fighters and bards to wizards and clerics, and everything in
between. However, due to their role as historians and preservers of
posterity, hopefuls must be literate and scholarly--for PF chroniclers
are more than mere treasure hunters.

   *Role*: The PF chronicler's missions often thrust her into the role
of party leader, and adventures typically result from, and revolve
around, his endless quests.

   *Alignment*: A PF chronicler's alignment largely determines her
motivations. Good characters tend to view their missions as noble
ventures, neutral characters seek to preserve knowledge for knowledge's
sake, and evil characters are driven by an urge to accumulate wealth
and add to their own glory.

41.3 Class Features
===================

The following are class features of the PF chronicler prestige class.

   *[Bardic Knowledge] (Ex)*: This ability is identical to the bard
class feature of the same name, and levels in this class stack with
levels in any other class that grants a similar ability.

   *Deep Pockets (Ex)*: A PF chronicler collects items as well as lore,
picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a
result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 100 gp per
class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into
a backpack, including [potions] and [scrolls] (but not any other sort
of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through
her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting
its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh
more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, the
chronicler can retrieve no more items until she refills her deep
pockets by spending a few hours and an amount of gold to bring her
total up to 100 gp per class level.

   In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she
gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her [light encumbrance]. This
does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient
distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same amount
of weight normally should. Finally, the PF chronicler gains a +4 bonus
on *note Sleight of Hand: #sleight-of-hand. checks made to conceal
small objects on her person.

   *Master Scribe (Ex)*: A PF chronicler adds her class level as a
bonus on all *note Linguistics: #linguistics. and *note Profession:
#profession. (scribe) checks, as well as *note Use Magic Device:
#use-magic-device. checks involving [scrolls] or other written magical
items. A PF chronicler can make *note Linguistics: #linguistics. checks
to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on *note
Linguistics: #linguistics. and *note Profession: #profession. (scribe)
checks, even if distracted or endangered.

   *Live to Tell the Tale (Ex)*: At 2nd level, once per day per two
class levels, a PF chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against
any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a
previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability
has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against
instantaneous effects.

   *Pathfinding (Ex)*: Beginning at 2nd level, a PF chronicler develops
an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through
difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A PF chronicler gains a
+5 bonus on *note Survival: #survival. checks made to avoid becoming
lost and to [Intelligence] checks to escape a _[maze]_ spell. In
addition, she always uses the “road or trail” [overland movement]
modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted.
With a DC 15 *note Survival: #survival. check, the PF chronicler can
extend this benefit to one companion per class level.

   *[Bardic Performance] (Su)*: At 3rd level, a PF chronicler gains
this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same
name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than
her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other
class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard
level.

   *Improved Aid (Ex)*: PF chroniclers frequently serve as the
companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their
deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level,
a PF chronicler using the [aid another] action grants a +4 bonus,
rather than the normal +2.

   *Epic Tales (Su)*: A 4th-level PF chronicler can inscribe a tale so
evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of bardic music
through the written word. To create an epic tale requires the PF
chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her bardic performance
ability equal to twice the duration of the epic tale (maximum duration
of 10 rounds), and any relevant [Performance] skill check is made with
*note Profession: #profession. (scribe) instead. An epic tale affects
only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally
apply for hearing a performance. A PF chronicler may apply the effects
of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale
retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires
1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration
equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds expended during
its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed.

   *Whispering Campaign (Ex)*: PF chroniclers influence the world
through their control of information and ability to shape public
perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the PF
chronicler can create the effect of a _[doom]_ spell as cast by a
sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is
a language-dependent effect.

   Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an
individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of
bardic music creates the effect of the _[enthrall]_ spell, but at the
end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their
attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction
of the PF chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level.

   *Inspire Action (Su)*: As a special use of bardic music, a 6th-level
PF chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge
of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action.
This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own
turn.

   At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a standard
action instead.

   *Call Down the Legends (Su)*: At 7th level, once per week as a
full-round action, a PF chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human
barbarians, as if she used a bronze _[horn of Valhalla]_; these
summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are
constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive
with the normal [starting equipment for barbarians] and attack anyone
the chronicler designates.

   *Greater Epic Tales (Su)*: At 8th level, the PF chronicler's written
word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic
tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect
as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by
the reader and use the reader's [Charisma] score where applicable.

   *Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su)*: Once per week as a full-round
action, a 10th-level PF chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human
barbarians, as if she used an iron _[horn of Valhalla]._ The summoned
barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are
constructs, with the [incorporeal] subtype (they take 50% of the damage
from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They
arrive wearing _+2 studded leather_and wielding _+1 [ghost touch]
greataxes_ (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures)
and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and
their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral
warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the
ancient heroes and must succeed at [Will] saves or become [shaken] for
1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the PF chronicler's [Charisma]
modifier).

42 Shadowdancer
***************

Civilized folk have always feared the night, barring themselves behind
doors or comforting themselves with bonfires when the shadows grow
long, rightfully wary of the creatures that prowl the darkness. Yet
long ago, some learned that the best way to conquer an enemy is to
embrace it. These were the first shadowdancers.

   Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness,
where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of
deception. Unbound by any specified morality or traditional code,
shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types who have
seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their abilities to safely
cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes
devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with
the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite
literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though
more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and
infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.

   *Role*: Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons. Many
adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of their teams
due to their incredible stealth and ability to surprise enemies with
lightning-quick attacks where they're least expected. For this reason,
their services are often sought out by those groups in need of scouts
or spies.

   *Alignment*: Because of their nature as visually duplicitous
tricksters, shadowdancers do not fit comfortably into the lawful
category, as many use their talents to avoid the eyes of legitimate
authority. Yet though they are allies of darkness, shadowdancers are
neither inherently evil nor predisposed to good. To them, the darkness
is simply the darkness, without any of the usual moral connotations
made by the unenlightened.

Table: Shadowdancer

42.3 Class Features
===================

All of the following are features of the shadowdancer prestige class.

   *Weapon and Armor Proficiency*: Shadowdancers are proficient with
the club, crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart,
mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and
composite), and short sword. Shadowdancers are proficient with light
armor but not with shields.

   *Hide in Plain Sight (Su)*: A shadowdancer can use the *note
Stealth: #stealth. skill even while being observed. As long as she is
within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a shadowdancer can hide herself
from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She
cannot, however, hide in her own shadow.

   *Evasion (Ex)*: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If
exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a [Reflex]
saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful
saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if the shadowdancer
is wearing light armor or no armor.

   *Darkvision (Ex)*: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains [darkvision]
out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has [darkvision], the range
increases by 30 feet.

   *Uncanny Dodge (Ex)*: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer cannot be caught
[flat-footed], even if the attacker is [invisible]. He still loses her
[Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized. An shadowdancer with this
ability can still lose his [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent
successfully uses the feint action against him.

   If a shadowdancer already has uncanny dodge from a different class,
he automatically gains [improved uncanny dodge] instead.

   *Rogue Talent*: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a
shadowdancer gains a special ability that allows her to confound her
foes. This functions as the [rogue talent] class feature. A
shadowdancer cannot select an individual talent more than once. If a
shadowdancer has the [advanced talents] rogue class feature, she can
chose from the [advanced talents] list instead.

   *Shadow Illusion* *(Sp)*: When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd level, she
can create visual illusions. This ability functions as _[silent
image],_ using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A
shadowdancer can use this ability once per day for every two
shadowdancer levels she has attained. The DC for this ability is
[Charisma]-based.

   *Summon Shadow (Su)*: At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a
shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's
alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature cannot
create spawn. The summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on [Will] saves
made to halve the damage from positive channeled energy and the shadow
cannot be turned or commanded. This shadow serves as a companion to the
shadowdancer and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer.
This shadow has a number of [hit points] equal to half the
shadowdancer's total. The shadow uses the shadowdancer's base attack
bonus and base save bonuses.

   If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses to
dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15 [Fortitude] save. If
the saving throw fails, the shadowdancer gains one permanent negative
level. A successful saving throw avoids this negative level. A
destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

   *Shadow Call (Sp)*: At 4th level, a shadowdancer can create
creatures and effects out of raw shadow. This ability functions as
_[shadow conjuration],_ using the shadowdancer's level as the caster
level. A shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 4th level,
plus one additional time per day for every two levels attained beyond
4th (2/day at 6th level, 3/day at 8th level, and 4/day at 10th level).
Upon reaching 10th level, this ability functions as _[greater shadow
conjuration]_. The DC for this ability is [Charisma]-based.

   *Shadow Jump (Su)*: At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the ability
to travel between shadows as if by means of a _[dimension door]_spell.
The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an
area with at least some dim light. A shadowdancer can jump up to a
total of 40 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump of 40
feet or four jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels higher than 4th,
the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day doubles (80 feet at 6th,
160 feet at 8th, and 320 feet at 10th). This amount can be split among
many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot
increment.

   *[Defensive Roll] (Ex)*: Starting at 5th level, once per day, a
shadowdancer can attempt to avoid a lethal blow. This functions as the
rogue's advanced talent of the same name.

   *Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)*: At 5th level and higher, shadowdancer
can no longer be[flanked]. This defense denies a [rogue] the ability to
[sneak attack] the assassin by[flanking] him, unless the attacker has
at least four more rogue levels than the target has assassin levels.

   If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the
levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the
minimum [rogue] level required to[flank] the character.

   *Slippery Mind (Ex)*: At 7th level, a shadowdancer becomes resilient
to enchantment spells. This functions as the rogue's advanced talent of
the same name.

   *Shadow Power (Sp)*: At 8th level, a shadowdancer can use raw shadow
to damage her foes. This ability functions as _[shadow evocation],_
using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can
use this ability once per day at 8th level, and one additional time per
day upon reaching 10th level. The DC for this ability is
[Charisma]-based.

   *Improved Evasion (Ex)*: This ability, gained at 10th level, works
like [evasion] (see above). A shadowdancer takes no damage at all on
successful saving throws against attacks that allow a [Reflex] saving
throw for half damage. What's more, she takes only half damage even if
she fails her saving throw.

   *Shadow Master (Su)*: At 10th level, whenever a shadowdancer is in
an area of dim light, she gains [DR] 10/-- and a +2 luck bonus on all
saving throws. In addition, whenever she successfully scores a
[critical hit] against a foe who is in an area of dim light, that foe
is blinded for 1d6 rounds.

43 Spell Lists
**************

An M or F appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists
denotes a spell with a material or focus component, respectively, that
is not normally included in a spell component pouch.

   *Order of Presentation*: In the spell lists and the short
descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical
order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When
a spell's name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is
alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

   *Hit Dice*: The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character
levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of
creatures. Creatures with Hit Dice only from their race, not from
classes, still have character levels equal to their Hit Dice.

   *Caster Level*: A spell's power often depends on caster level, which
is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a
particular spell. A creature with no classes has a caster level equal
to its Hit Dice unless otherwise specified. The word “level” in the
short descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.

   *Creatures and Characters*: The words “creature” and “character” are
used synonymously in the short descriptions.
