# Core Rulebook

**Version 0.1 (EARLY BETA)**

*This work is in early beta. Many of the tables are not formatted
properly and the work has not been checked for accuracy (although
the text is pretty much lifted from it's previous so should be
usable). Bug reports and patches are very welcome!*

This has been converted into pandoc markdown by Nathanael Farley.

Words that are enclosed by square brackets [like so] are links to
other parts of the prd not in this book (except if you are
reading this as an info, in which case links are disabled, and
all appear like this; if you don't know what info is, you're not
reading one). If words in square brackets are supposed to point
to a place in this book, please report it as a bug.

Please report any bugs to
