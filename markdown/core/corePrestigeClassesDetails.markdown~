# Arcane Archer

Many who seek to perfect the use of the bow sometimes pursue the
path of the arcane archer. Arcane archers are masters of ranged
combat, as they possess the ability to strike at targets with
unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful
spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers fly at weird and uncanny
angles to strike at foes around corners, and can pass through
solid objects to hit enemies that cower behind such cover. At the
height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most
powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.

Those who have trained as both rangers and wizards excel as
arcane archers, although other multiclass combinations are not
unheard of. Arcane archers may be found wherever elves travel,
but not all are allies of the elves. Many, particularly
half-elven arcane archers, use elven traditions solely for their
own gain, or worse, against the elves whose very traditions they
adhere to.

**Role**: Arcane archers deal death from afar, winnowing down
opponents while their allies rush into hand-to-hand combat. With
their capacity to unleash hails of arrows on the enemy, they
represent the pinnacle of ranged combat.

**Alignment**: Arcane archers can be of any alignment. Elf or
half-elf arcane arches tend to be free-spirited and are rarely
lawful. Similarly, it is uncommon for elven arcane archers to be
evil, and overall the path of the arcane archer is more often
pursued by good or neutral characters.

**Hit Die**: d10.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the arcane archer
prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An arcane archer is proficient
with all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
and [martial
weapons](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons),
light armor, medium armor, and shields.

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, an arcane archer
gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an
arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the
prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a
character of that class would have gained, except for additional
spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous
spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before
becoming an arcane archer, he must decide to which class he adds
the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Enhance Arrows (Su)**: At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an
arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1
enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means,
the archer need not spend gold pieces to accomplish this task.
However, an archer's magic arrows only function for him.

In addition, the arcane archer's arrows gain a number of
additional qualities as he gains additional levels. The
elemental, elemental burst, and aligned qualities can be changed
once per day, when the arcane archer prepares spells or, in the
case of spontaneous spellcasters, after 8 hours of rest.

At 3rd level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer
gains one of the following elemental themed weapon qualities:
*[flaming](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming)*,*[frost](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-frost)*,
or *[shock](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-shock)*.

At 5th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer
gains the
*[distance](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-distance)* weapon
quality.

At 7th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer
gains one of the following elemental burst weapon qualities:
*[flaming
burst](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst)*, *[icy
burst](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-icy-burst)*, or
*[shocking
burst](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-shocking-burst)*. This
ability replaces the ability gained at 3rd level.

At 9th level, every nonmagical arrow fired by an arcane archer
gains one of the following aligned weapon qualities:
*[anarchic](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-anarchic)*,
*[axiomatic](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-axiomatic)*,
*[holy](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy)*, or
*[unholy](../magicItems/weapons.html#_unholy)*. The arcane archer
cannot choose an ability that is the opposite of his alignment
(for example, a lawful good arcane archer could not choose
*[anarchic](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-anarchic)* or
*[unholy](../magicItems/weapons.html#_unholy)* as his weapon
quality).

The bonuses granted by a magic bow apply as normal to arrows that
have been enhanced with this ability. Only the larger enhancement
bonus applies. Duplicate abilities do not stack.

**Imbue Arrow** **(Sp)**: At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains
the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow
is fired, the spell's area is centered where the arrow lands,
even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster.
This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than
the spell's range. A spell cast in this way uses its standard
casting time and the arcane archer can fire the arrow as part of
the casting. The arrow must be fired during the round that the
casting is completed or the spell is wasted. If the arrow misses,
the spell is wasted.

**Seeker Arrow** **(Sp)**: At 4th level, an arcane archer can
launch an arrow at a target known to him within range, and the
arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an
unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents
the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment
modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using
this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part
of the action). An arcane archer can use this ability once per
day at 4th level, and one additional time per day for every two
levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of four times per day at 10th
level.

**Phase Arrow** **(Sp)**: At 6th level, an arcane archer can
launch an arrow once per day at a target known to him within
range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path,
passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any
magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover,
concealment, armor, and shield modifiers, but otherwise the
attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard
action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action). An arcane
archer can use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one
additional time per day for every two levels beyond 6th, to a
maximum of three times per day at 10th level.

**Hail of Arrows** **(Sp)**: In lieu of his regular attacks, once
per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow
at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target
for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses
the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be
targeted by a single arrow.

**Arrow of Death** **(Sp)**: At 10th level, an arcane archer can
create a special type of*[slaying
arrow](../magicItems/weapons.html#_slaying-arrow)*that forces the
target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save or be slain
immediately. The DC of this save is equal to 20 + the arcane
archer's [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
modifier. It takes 1 day to make a *[slaying
arrow](../magicItems/weapons.html#_slaying-arrow)*, and the arrow
only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The
*[slaying arrow](../magicItems/weapons.html#_slaying-arrow)*lasts
no longer than 1 year, and the archer can only have one such
arrow in existence at a time.

Arcane Trickster

# Arcane Trickster

Few can match the guile and craftiness of arcane tricksters.
These prodigious thieves blend the subtlest aspects of the arcane
with the natural cunning of the bandit and the scoundrel, using
spells to enhance their natural thieving abilities. Arcane
tricksters can pick locks, disarm traps, and lift purses from a
safe distance using their magical legerdemain, and as often as
not seek humiliation as a goal to triumph over their foes than
more violent solutions.

The path to becoming an arcane trickster is a natural progression
for rogues who have supplemented their talents for theft with the
study of the arcane. Multiclass rogue/sorcerers and rogue/bards
are the most common arcane tricksters, although other
combinations are possible. Arcane tricksters are most often found
in large, cosmopolitan cities where their talents for magical
larceny can be most effectively put to use, prowling the streets
and stealing from the unwary.

**Role**: With their mastery of magic, arcane tricksters can make
for even more subtle or confounding opponents than standard
rogues. Ranged legerdemain enhances their skill as thieves, and
their ability to make sneak attacks
without[flanking](../combat.html#_flanking) or as part of a spell
can make arcane tricksters formidable damage-dealers.

**Alignment**: All arcane tricksters have a penchant for mischief
and thievery, and are therefore never lawful. Although they
sometimes acquire their magical abilities through the studious
path of wizardry, their magical aptitude more often stems from a
sorcerous bloodline. As such, many arcane tricksters are of a
chaotic alignment.

**Hit Die**: d6.

## Requirements

To qualify to become an arcane trickster, a character must
fulfill all of the following criteria.

**Alignment**: Any nonlawful.

**Skills**: [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) 4 ranks,
[Escape Artist](../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist) 4
ranks, [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (arcana)
4 ranks.

**Spells**: Ability to cast *[mage
hand](../spells/mageHand.html#_mage-hand)*and at least one arcane
spell of 2nd level or higher.

**Special**: [Sneak attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack)
+2d6.

  : Table: Arcane Trickster

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the arcane trickster
prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Arcane tricksters gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: When a new arcane trickster level is gained,
the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained
a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the
prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a
character of that class would have gained, except for additional
spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous
spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one spellcasting class before
becoming an arcane trickster, she must decide to which class she
adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Ranged Legerdemain (Su)**: An arcane trickster can use [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) and
[Sleight of Hand](../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand)
at a range of 30 feet. Working at a distance increases the normal
skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on
this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or
less. She can only use this ability if she has at least 1 rank in
the skill being used.

**Sneak Attack**: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the
same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other
level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an arcane trickster gets
a [sneak attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack) bonus from
another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

**Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex)**: Beginning at 3rd level, once per
day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack
she makes to be a [sneak
attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack) (the target can be
no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a
ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class), but only against that attack.
The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are
not subject to [critical hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits)s
take no extra damage (though they still lose any
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against the attack).

At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per
day.

**Tricky Spells (Su)**: Starting at 5th level, an arcane
trickster can cast her spells without their somatic or verbal
components, as if using the [Still
Spell](../feats.html#_still-spell) and [Silent
Spell](../feats.html#_silent-spell) feats. Spells cast using this
ability do not increase in spell level or casting time. She can
use this ability 3 times per day at 5th level and one additional
time per every two levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5 times per
day at 9th level. The arcane trickster decides to use this
ability at the time of casting.

**Invisible Thief (Su)**: At 9th level, an arcane trickster can
become [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible), as if under the
effects of *[greater
invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility-greater),*
as a free action. She can remain
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) for a number of rounds
per day equal to her arcane trickster level. Her caster level for
this effect is equal to her caster level. These rounds need not
be consecutive.

**Surprise Spells**: At 10th level, an arcane trickster can add
her sneak attack damage to any spell that deals damage, if the
targets are [flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed). This
additional damage only applies to spells that deal hit point
damage, and the additional damage is of the same type as the
spell. If the spell allows a saving throw to negate or halve the
damage, it also negates or halves the sneak attack damage.

Assassin

# Assassin

A mercenary undertaking his task with cold, professional
detachment, the assassin is equally adept at espionage, bounty
hunting, and terrorism. At his core, an assassin is an artisan,
and his medium is death. Trained in a variety of killing
techniques, assassins are among the most feared classes.

While nearly any class is capable of becoming an assassin, rogues
suit the part more than any other, from both an ability viewpoint
and an ideological one. Though they make excellent allies during
combat, assassins excel in more clandestine situations, and the
best assassins are the ones the victims never knew existed.

**Role**: Assassins tend to be loners by nature, seeing
companions as liabilities at best. Sometimes an assassin's
missions put him in the company of adventurers for long stretches
at a time, but few people are comfortable trusting a professional
assassin to watch their backs in a fight, and are more likely to
let the emotionless killer scout ahead or help prepare ambushes.

**Alignment**: Due to its necessary selfishness and callous
indifference toward taking lives, the assassin class attracts
those with evil alignments more than any others. Because the
profession requires a degree of self-discipline, chaotic
characters are ill suited to becoming these shadowy killers.
Neutral characters sometimes become assassins, frequently
thinking of themselves as simple professionals performing a job,
yet the nature of their duties inevitably pushes them toward an
evil alignment.

**Hit Die**: d8.

## Requirements

To qualify to become an assassin, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

**Alignment**: Any evil.

**Skills**: [Disguise](../skills/disguise.html#_disguise) 2
ranks, [Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) 5 ranks.

**Special**: The character must kill someone for no other reason
than to become an assassin.

  : Table: Assassin

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the assassin prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Assassins are proficient with
the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart,
rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword.
Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

**Sneak Attack**: This is exactly like the rogue ability of the
same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other
level (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th). If an assassin gets a [sneak
attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack) bonus from another
source, the bonuses on damage stack.

**Death Attack (Ex)**: If an assassin studies his victim for 3
rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that
successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional
effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target
(assassin's choice). Studying the victim is a standard action.
The death attack fails if the target detects the assassin or
recognizes the assassin as an enemy (although the attack might
still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to his
[Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) or
is[flanked](../combat.html#_flanking)). If the victim of such a
death attack fails a [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save
(DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's
[Int](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier) against the
kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the
paralysis effect, the victim is rendered
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) and unable to act for 1d6
rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's
saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack.
Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must
make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her
save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3
rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are
required before he can attempt another death attack.

**Poison Use**: Assassins are trained in the use of poison and
cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying
[poison](../glossary.html#_poison) to a blade (see
[Poison](../glossary.html#_poison)).

**Save Bonus against Poison**: At 2nd level, the assassin gains a
+1 saving throw bonus against poisons. This bonus increase by +1
every two levels.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an assassin cannot be
caught [flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed), even if the
attacker is [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible). He still
loses his [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if immobilized. An assassin
with this ability can still lose his
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if an opponent successfully
uses the feint action against him.

If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class,
he automatically gains [improved uncanny
dodge](#improved-uncanny-dodge-assassin) instead.

**Hidden Weapons (Ex)**: At 4th level, an assassin becomes a
master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level
to all [Sleight of
Hand](../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand) skill checks
made to prevent others from noticing them.

**True Death (Su)**: Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an
assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from
the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from
the dead using *[raise
dead](../spells/raiseDead.html#_raise-dead)* or similar magic
must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the
assassin's level or the spell fails and the material component is
wasted. Casting *[remove
curse](../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)* the round
before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead
negates this chance. The DC of the *[remove
curse](../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)* is 10 + the
assassin's level.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 5th level and higher, an
assassin can no longer be[flanked](../combat.html#_flanking).
This defense denies a [rogue](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue) the
ability to sneak attack the assassin
by[flanking](../combat.html#_flanking) him, unless the attacker
has at least four more [rogue](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue)
levels than the target has assassin levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the
levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to
determine the minimum [rogue](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue) level
required to[flank](../combat.html#_flanking) the character.

**Quiet Death (Ex)**: At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a
creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can
also make a [Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) check,
opposed by [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception)
checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying
him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even
notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the
assassin to avoid detection.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Su)**: At 8th level, an assassin can use
the [Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) skill even while
being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of
shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open
without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot,
however, hide in his own shadow.

**Swift Death (Ex)**: At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can
make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe
beforehand. He must still [sneak
attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack) his foe using a
melee weapon that deals damage.

**Angel of Death (Su)**: At 10th level, the assassin becomes a
master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a
successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to
crumble to dust. This prevents *[raise
dead](../spells/raiseDead.html#_raise-dead)* and
*[resurrection](../spells/resurrection.html#_resurrection)*
(although *[true
resurrection](../spells/trueResurrection.html#_true-resurrection)*
works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this
ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the
target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability
is wasted with no effect.

Dragon Disciple

# Dragon Disciple

As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures
in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with
unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional
individuals. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures
has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various
magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a
result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many
races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline
and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of
their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.

Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to
channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome
warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished
sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of
dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power
of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight
on leathery wings, and—at the pinnacle of their abilities—assume
the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples
can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.

**Role**: With the magic of a spellcasting class at their
disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a
magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling
damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples'
draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters
even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and flight
to destroy their foes directly.

**Alignment**: Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although
they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples
that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial
white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil.
Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as
stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good
alignments.

**Hit Die**: d12.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a dragon disciple, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Race**: Any nondragon.

**Skills**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(arcana) 5 ranks.

**Languages**: Draconic.

**Spellcasting**: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells without
preparation. If the character has
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer) levels, he must
have the [draconic
bloodline](../classes/sorcerer.html#_draconic). If the character
gains levels of [sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer)
after taking this class, he must take the [draconic
bloodline](../classes/sorcerer.html#_draconic).

## Class Skills

The dragon disciple's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are [Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy)
([Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)), [Escape
Artist](../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist)

  : Table: Dragon Disciple

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the dragon disciple
prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Dragon disciples gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, a dragon disciple
gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an
arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the
prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a
character of that class would have gained, except for additional
spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous
spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before
becoming a dragon disciple, he must decide to which class he adds
the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Blood of Dragons**: A dragon disciple adds his level to his
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer) levels when
determining the powers gained from his bloodline. If the dragon
disciple does not have levels of
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer), he instead gains
bloodline powers of the [draconic
bloodline](../classes/sorcerer.html#_draconic), using his dragon
disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses
gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level
in this class and that type must be the same as his
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer) type. This ability
does not grant bonus spells to a
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer) unless he
possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells
are automatically granted if the
[sorcerer](../classes/sorcerer.html#_sorcerer) gains spell slots
of the spell's level.

**Natural Armor Increase (Ex)**: As his skin thickens, a dragon
disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical
aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an
increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any), as
indicated on [Table: Dragon
Disciple](#table-11-4-dragon-disciple). These armor bonuses
stack.

**Ability Boost (Ex)**: As a dragon disciple gains levels in this
prestige class, his ability scores increase as noted on [Table:
Dragon Disciple](#table-11-4-dragon-disciple). These increases
stack and are gained as if through level advancement.

**Bloodline Feat**: Upon reaching 2nd level, and every three
levels thereafter, a dragon disciple receives one bonus feat,
chosen from the draconic bloodline's [bonus feat
list](../classes/sorcerer.html#_draconic).

**Dragon Bite (Ex)**: At 2nd level, whenever the dragon disciple
uses his bloodline to grow claws, he also gains a bite attack.
This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage
(1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1–1/2 times the
dragon disciple's Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level,
this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of
damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline.

**Breath Weapon (Su)**: At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the
breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet
grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this
ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an
additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape
of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by
the dragon disciple, as detailed under the [Draconic sorcerer
bloodline](../classes/sorcerer.html#_draconic) description.

**Blindsense (Ex)**: At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense) with a
range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple
notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) checks to
notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense)
ability, provided that he has [line of
effect](../magic.html#_line-of-effect) to that creature.

Any opponent the dragon disciple cannot see still has total
concealment against him, and the dragon disciple still has the
normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment.
Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense). A
creature with
[blindsense](../glossary.html#_blindsight-and-blindsense) is
still denied its [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)
bonus to [Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) against
attacks from creatures it cannot see. At 10th level, the range of
this ability increases to 60 feet.

**Dragon Form** **(Sp)**: At 7th level, a dragon disciple can
assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like *[form of
the dragon
I](../spells/formOfTheDragon.html#_form-of-the-dragon-i)*. At
10th level, this ability functions as *[form of the dragon
II](../spells/formOfTheDragon.html#_form-of-the-dragon-ii)* and
the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His
caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer
levels for his draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts *form of the
dragon,* he must assume the form of a dragon of the same type as
his bloodline.

**Wings (Su)**: At 9th level, a dragon disciple gains the wings
bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power.
Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the
bloodline, the dragon disciple's speed increases to 90 feet.

Duelist

# Duelist

Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay. They move
with a grace unmatched by most foes, parrying blows and
countering attacks with swift thrusts of their blades. They may
wear armor, but generally eschew such bulky protection as their
grace allows them to dodge their opponents with ease. While
others flounder on treacherous terrain, duelists charge nimbly
across the battlefield, leaping and tumbling into the fray. They
thrive in melee, where their skill with the blade allows them to
make sudden attacks against clumsy foes and to cripple opponents
with particularly well-placed thrusts of the blade.

The path to the duelist is natural for rogues and bards, as those
classes do not rely on armor for defense, although nearly as many
duelists come from the ranks of fighters and rangers. They are
often found in those regions that possess elaborate rules and
etiquette for battle.

**Role**: The abilities of duelists complement those rogues or
bards who wish to accentuate their fighting prowess but, because
of their lack of heavy armor, are afraid to leap into combat.
Duelists fight in the forefront alongside fighters, barbarians,
and other melee combatants, deftly avoiding the blades of their
opponents while expertly targeting their vulnerabilities.

**Alignment**: Duelists can be of any alignment, although since
most hail from backgrounds as rogues or bards, they tend to
eschew lawful behavior. Lawful duelists are not unheard of,
however, and such duelists often adhere to a strict code of
honor, refusing to attack unarmed or obviously inferior
opponents.

**Hit Die**: d10.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a duelist, a character must fulfill all the
following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus**: +6.

**Skills**: [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) 2
ranks, [Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) 2 ranks.

**Feats**: [Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge),
[Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility), [Weapon
Finesse](../feats.html#_weapon-finesse).

## Class Skills

The duelist's class skills (and the key ability for each skill)
are [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics)
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff)
([Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)), [Escape
Artist](../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist)
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception)
([Wis](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)),
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform)
([Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)), and [Sense
Motive](../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive)
([Wis](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)).

**Skill Ranks at Each Level**: 4 +

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the duelist prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: The duelist is proficient with
all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)[and](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)[martial
weapons](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons).
Duelists are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

**Canny Defense (Ex)**: When wearing light or no armor and not
using a shield, a duelist adds 1 point of
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) bonus (if
any) per duelist class level to her
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to modify
[Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) while wielding a melee
weapon. If a duelist is caught
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed) or otherwise denied
her [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus, she
also loses this bonus.

**Precise Strike (Ex)**: A duelist gains the ability to strike
precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding her
duelist level to her damage roll.

When making a precise strike, a duelist cannot attack with a
weapon in her other hand or use a shield. A duelist's precise
strike only works against living creatures with discernible
anatomies. Any creature that is immune to [critical
hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits)s is also immune to a precise
strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from
[critical hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits)s also protects a
creature from a precise strike.

**Improved Reaction (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a duelist gains a +2
bonus on initiative checks. At 8th level, the bonus increases to
+4. This bonus stacks with the benefit provided by the [Improved
Initiative](../feats.html#_improved-initiative) feat.

**Parry (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a duelist learns to parry the
attacks of other creatures, causing them to miss. Whenever the
duelist takes a full attack action with a light or one-handed
piercing weapon, she can elect not to take one of her attacks. At
any time before her next turn, she can attempt to parry an attack
against her or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry
the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same
bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous
action. If her attack roll is greater than the roll of the
attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each
size category that the attacking creature is larger than the
duelist, the duelist takes a –4 penalty on her attack roll. The
duelist also takes a –4 penalty when attempting to parry an
attack made against an adjacent ally. The duelist must declare
the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before
the roll is made.

**Enhanced Mobility (Ex)**: Starting at 3rd level, when wearing
light or no armor and not using a shield, a duelist gains an
additional +4 bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against
attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of a threatened
square.

**Combat Reflexes**: At 4th level, a duelist gains the benefit of
the [Combat Reflexes](../feats.html#_combat-reflexes) feat when
using a light or one-handed piercing weapon.

**Grace (Ex)**: At 4th level, a duelist gains an additional +2
competence bonus on all [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving
throws. This ability functions for a duelist only when she is
wearing light or no armor and not using a shield.

**Riposte (Ex)**: Starting at 5th level, a duelist can make an
attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack she
successfully parries, so long as the creature she is attacking is
within reach.

**Acrobatic Charge (Ex)**: At 6th level, a duelist gains the
ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may
charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement.
Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make
appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain.

**Elaborate Defense (Ex)**: At 7th level and higher, if a duelist
chooses to fight defensively or use total defense in melee
combat, she gains an additional +1 [dodge
bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) for every 3 levels of duelist
she has attained.

**Deflect Arrows**: At 9th level, a duelist gains the benefit of
the [Deflect Arrows](../feats.html#_deflect-arrows) feat when
using a light or one-handed piercing weapon. The duelist does not
need a free hand to use this feat.

**No Retreat (Ex)**: At 9th level, enemies adjacent to the
duelist that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of
opportunity from the duelist.

**Crippling Critical (Ex)**: When you confirm a [critical
hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits) using a light or one-handed
piercing weapon, you can apply one of the following penalties in
addition to the damage dealt: reduce all of the target's speeds
by 10 feet (minimum 5 feet), 1d4 points of Strength or
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) damage, –4 penalty
on all saving throws, –4 penalty to [Armor
Class](../combat.html#_armor-class), or 2d6 points of bleed
damage. These penalties last for 1 minute, except for ability
damage, which must be healed normally, and bleed damage, which
continues until the target receives magic healing or a DC 15
[Heal](../skills/heal.html#_heal) skill check.

Eldritch Knight

# Eldritch Knight

Fearsome warriors and spellcasters, eldritch knights are rare
among magic-users in their ability to wade into battle alongside
fighters, barbarians, and other martial classes. Those who must
face eldritch knights in combat fear them greatly, for their
versatility on the battlefield is tremendous; against heavily
armed and armored opponents they may level crippling spells,
while opposing spellcasters meet their ends on an eldritch
knight's blade.

Because the road to becoming an eldritch knight requires both
martial prowess and arcane power, eldritch knights almost always
begin their paths as multiclassed characters, such as
fighter/wizards or ranger/sorcerers. They may be found wherever
studies of the arcane are as prevalent as martial training.

**Role**: Eldritch knights blend the abilities of fighting
classes and spellcasters, hurling magic at the enemy one moment
and hewing down their opponents with steel the next. They are
just as comfortable fighting in the thick of combat as they are
casting spells at foes while remaining safely behind their
compatriots. Their versatility makes them valuable allies when
the nature of an upcoming battle is unclear.

**Alignment**: The road to becoming an eldritch knight is as
varied as the paths leading to apprenticeship under a wizard or a
career as a soldier, and eldritch knights can therefore be of any
alignment. Maintaining a balance between studies of arcane lore
and martial techniques requires great discipline, however, and
for that reason many favor lawful alignments.

**Hit Die**: d10.

## Requirements

To qualify to become an eldritch knight, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Weapon Proficiency**: Must be proficient with all [martial
weapons](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons).

**Spells**: Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells.

  : Table: Eldritch Knight

## Class Features

All of the following are features of the eldritch knight prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Eldritch knights gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Bonus Feat**: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a
bonus [combat feat](../feats.html#_combat-feats). This is in
addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets
from advancing levels. The character must still meet any
prerequisites for these bonus feats. An eldritch knight gains an
additional [combat feat](../feats.html#_combat-feats) at 5th and
9th level.

**Diverse Training**: An eldritch knight adds his level to any
levels of [fighter](../classes/fighter.html#_fighter) he might
have for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if
he has no fighter levels, treat his eldritch knight levels as
levels of fighter). He also adds his level to any levels in an
arcane spellcasting class for the purpose of meeting the
prerequisites for feats.

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, an eldritch knight
gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an
arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the
prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a
character of that class would have gained, except for additional
spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous
spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before
becoming an eldritch knight, he must decide to which class he
adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Spell Critical (Su)**: At 10th level, whenever an eldritch
knight successfully confirms a [critical
hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits), he can cast a spell as a
swift action. The spell must include the target of the attack as
one of its targets or in its area of effect. Casting this spell
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The caster must still
meet all of the spell's components and must roll for arcane spell
failure if necessary.

Loremaster

# Loremaster

The loremaster is a gatherer and keeper of secrets. He is often
obsessed by the written word, with cryptic and arcane lore
serving as his devoted mistress. Holding to the adage that
knowledge is power, the loremaster often forsakes material wealth
and personal glory for rare or unusual information, an endless
quest that brings him ever closer to his unattainable goal:
perfection through edification. Often rejecting what he views as
the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his
short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only
worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might.
After all, wealth is spent, passions fade, and the power of the
body is limited by age, while the mind's capacity to grow greater
with time is infinite.

The loremaster class holds little appeal for
non-spellcasters—indeed, before one can devote a life to the
studies and traditions of the loremaster, a character must first
master several spells of the school of divination. Most
loremasters begin their paths as clerics or wizards, but any
character capable of casting enough divination spells can,
eventually, become a loremaster.

**Role**: Loremasters' lives are spent in study, research, and
fieldwork. While the first two lend themselves to the
loremaster's reputation as a bookish recluse, the latter
oftentimes forces a loremaster to seek out the aid of adventurers
who, through a mutually beneficial arrangement, might provide a
degree of protection to the scholar while he seeks whatever
knowledge he is after. For his part, the loremaster provides a
wealth of information and arcane firepower to a party. Some
loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to leave
the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old
lore can be discovered in books—new lore must be sought out in
the world. These more active loremasters might join up with an
adventuring party for the benefit of the journey, content with
whatever knowledge might be picked up along the way.

**Alignment**: Most loremasters cannot be bothered with
distracting and pointless philosophies such as ethics, and so
tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.

**Hit Die**: d6.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a loremaster, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

**Skills**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (any
two) 7 ranks in each.

**Feats**: Any three [metamagic](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats)
or [item creation feats](../feats.html#_item-creation-feats),
plus [Skill Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus)
([Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [any individual
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) skill]).

**Spells**: Able to cast seven different divination spells, one
of which must be 3rd level or higher.

## Class Skills

skill) are [Appraise](../skills/appraise.html#_appraise)

## Class Features

All of the following are Class Features of the loremaster
prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Loremasters gain no proficiency
with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day/Spells Known**: When a new loremaster level is
gained, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also
gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before
adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other
benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for
additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous
spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting.
If a character had more than one spellcasting class before
becoming a loremaster, he must decide to which class he adds the
new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

**Secret**: At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st
(3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the loremaster chooses one secret from
the Loremaster Secrets table. His level plus
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier
determines which secrets he can choose. He can't choose the same
secret twice.

If used to create a *[legend
lore](../spells/legendLore.html#_legend-lore)* effect, this
ability has a casting time of 1 minute, regardless of how much
information is already known about the subject in question.

Mystic Theurge

# Mystic Theurge

Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities
and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as
well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding
no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting
their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply
hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations,
mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through
the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that
perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the
nature of this reality, but destiny itself.

Mystic theurges are drawn from multiclass spellcasters who can
already cast both arcane and divine spells, and the powers that
they gain increase their mastery over both.

**Role**: The mystic theurge is a powerful component for any
party, supplying magic for attack, defense, and healing. Mystic
theurges travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts,
magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms
about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that
group's goals do not directly conflict with their own.

**Alignment**: The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem
from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be
neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges,
whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their
powers for either the benefit—or control—of society. Chaotic
mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally
requires great personal discipline.

**Hit Die**: d6.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a mystic theurge, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Skills**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(arcana) 3 ranks,
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (religion) 3
ranks.

**Spells**: Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells and 2nd-level
arcane spells.

## Class Skills

The mystic theurge's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(arcana) ([Int](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)),
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (religion)

  : Table: Mystic Theurge

## Class Features

All of the following are features of the mystic theurge prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Mystic theurges gain no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: When a new mystic theurge level is gained,
the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a
level in any one arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before
he added the prestige class and any one divine spellcasting class
he belonged to previously. He does not, however, gain other
benefits a character of that class would have gained. This
essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the
level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine
spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per
day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character
had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one
divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he
must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge
for the purpose of determining spells per day.

**Combined Spells (Su)**: A mystic theurge can prepare and cast
spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the available
slots from any of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared
or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they
originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell
at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. At 1st
level, a mystic theurge can prepare 1st-level spells from one of
his spellcasting classes using the 2nd-level slots of the other
spellcasting class. Every two levels thereafter, the level of
spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a
maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells would take
up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do not
change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting
class used to cast the spell.

Spontaneous spellcasters can only select spells that they have
prepared that day using non-spontaneous classes for this ability,
even if the spells have already been cast. For example, a
cleric/sorcerer/mystic theurge can use this ability to
spontaneously cast a *[bless](../spells/bless.html#_bless)* spell
using a 2nd-level sorcerer spell slot, if the character had a
prepared *[bless](../spells/bless.html#_bless)*spell using a
1st-level cleric spell slot, even if that spell had already been
cast that day.

**Spell Synthesis (Su)**: At 10th level, a mystic theurge can
cast two spells, one from each of his spellcasting classes, using
one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time.
The mystic theurge can make any decisions concerning the spells
independently. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a
–2 penalty on saves made against each spell. The mystic theurge
receives a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell
resistance with these two spells. A mystic theurge may use this
ability once per day.

PF Chronicler

# PF Chronicler {#PF-chronicler}

Brave explorers and scavengers of lost or forgotten knowledge, PF
chroniclers are quintessential adventurers, exploring the world
for esoteric truths, magical and mundane relics and artifacts,
and new and mysterious vistas, be they wonderful or terrible. For
some, this journey is purely about the wealth, for others the
glory of discovery, and still more are stirred by the
irresistible drive to uncover the bones of the ages and legends
of forgotten epochs in an effort to chronicle the deeds of
yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

The PF chronicler class attracts any who see the world as a great
mystery to be unraveled, and thus has a diverse and varied
following, from fighters and bards to wizards and clerics, and
everything in between. However, due to their role as historians
and preservers of posterity, hopefuls must be literate and
scholarly—for PF chroniclers are more than mere treasure hunters.

**Role**: The PF chronicler's missions often thrust her into the
role of party leader, and adventures typically result from, and
revolve around, his endless quests.

**Alignment**: A PF chronicler's alignment largely determines her
motivations. Good characters tend to view their missions as noble
ventures, neutral characters seek to preserve knowledge for
knowledge's sake, and evil characters are driven by an urge to
accumulate wealth and add to their own glory.

**Hit Dice**: d8.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a PF chronicler, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Skills**:
[Linguistics](../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics) 3 ranks,
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) (oratory) 5 ranks,
[Profession](../skills/profession.html#_profession) (scribe) 5
ranks.

**Special**: Must have authored or scribed something (other than
a magical scroll or other device) for which another person (not a
PC) paid at least 50 gp.

  : Table: PF Chronicler

## Class Features

The following are class features of the PF chronicler prestige
class.

**[Bardic Knowledge](../classes/bard.html#_bardic-knowledge)
(Ex)**: This ability is identical to the bard class feature of
the same name, and levels in this class stack with levels in any
other class that grants a similar ability.

**Deep Pockets (Ex)**: A PF chronicler collects items as well as
lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her
travels. As a result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth
up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that
can reasonably fit into a backpack, including
[potions](../magicItems/potions.html#_potions) and
[scrolls](../magicItems/scrolls.html#_scrolls) (but not any other
sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may
dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that
time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This
item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining
cost reaches 0, the chronicler can retrieve no more items until
she refills her deep pockets by spending a few hours and an
amount of gold to bring her total up to 100 gp per class level.

In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she
gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her [light
encumbrance](../additionalRules.html#_carrying-capacity). This
does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient
distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same
amount of weight normally should. Finally, the PF chronicler
gains a +4 bonus on [Sleight of
Hand](../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand) checks made
to conceal small objects on her person.

**Master Scribe (Ex)**: A PF chronicler adds her class level as a
bonus on all
[Linguistics](../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics) and
[Profession](../skills/profession.html#_profession) (scribe)
checks, as well as [Use Magic
Device](../skills/useMagicDevice.html#_use-magic-device) checks
involving [scrolls](../magicItems/scrolls.html#_scrolls) or other
written magical items. A PF chronicler can make
[Linguistics](../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics) checks to
decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on
[Linguistics](../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics) and
[Profession](../skills/profession.html#_profession) (scribe)
checks, even if distracted or endangered.

**Live to Tell the Tale (Ex)**: At 2nd level, once per day per
two class levels, a PF chronicler can attempt a new saving throw
against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving
throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally
permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not
allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects.

**Pathfinding (Ex)**: Beginning at 2nd level, a PF chronicler
develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading
others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A
PF chronicler gains a +5 bonus on
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) checks made to
avoid becoming lost and to
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) checks to
escape a *[maze](../spells/maze.html#_maze)* spell. In addition,
she always uses the “road or trail” [overland
movement](../additionalRules.html#_overland-movement) modifier
even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With
a DC 15 [Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) check, the
PF chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class
level.

**[Bardic Performance](../classes/bard.html#_bardic-performance)
(Su)**: At 3rd level, a PF chronicler gains this ability, which
functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except
that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her
class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other
class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective
bard level.

**Improved Aid (Ex)**: PF chroniclers frequently serve as the
companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording
their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting
at 3rd level, a PF chronicler using the [aid
another](../combat.html#_aid-another) action grants a +4 bonus,
rather than the normal +2.

**Epic Tales (Su)**: A 4th-level PF chronicler can inscribe a
tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of
bardic music through the written word. To create an epic tale
requires the PF chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her
bardic performance ability equal to twice the duration of the
epic tale (maximum duration of 10 rounds), and any relevant
[Performance](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill check is
made with [Profession](../skills/profession.html#_profession)
(scribe) instead. An epic tale affects only the reader, but it
grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a
performance. A PF chronicler may apply the effects of any feats
that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains
its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1
hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a
duration equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds
expended during its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's
magic is consumed.

**Whispering Campaign (Ex)**: PF chroniclers influence the world
through their control of information and ability to shape public
perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the
PF chronicler can create the effect of a
*[doom](../spells/doom.html#_doom)* spell as cast by a sorcerer
of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a
language-dependent effect.

Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target
(an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This
form of bardic music creates the effect of the
*[enthrall](../spells/enthrall.html#_enthrall)* spell, but at the
end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift
their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in
the direction of the PF chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class
level.

**Inspire Action (Su)**: As a special use of bardic music, a
6th-level PF chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to
a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take
an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's
number of actions on his own turn.

At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a
standard action instead.

**Call Down the Legends (Su)**: At 7th level, once per week as a
full-round action, a PF chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human
barbarians, as if she used a bronze *[horn of
Valhalla](../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_horn-of-valhalla)*;
these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The
barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem
to be). They arrive with the normal [starting equipment for
barbarians](../creatingNPCs.html#_step-6-gear) and attack anyone
the chronicler designates.

**Greater Epic Tales (Su)**: At 8th level, the PF chronicler's
written word gains power. This ability functions like the
chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the
bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability,
but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score where
applicable.

**Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su)**: Once per week as a full-round
action, a 10th-level PF chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level
human barbarians, as if she used an iron *[horn of
Valhalla](../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_horn-of-valhalla).*
The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning
loyalty. They are constructs, with the
[incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) subtype (they take
50% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from
nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing *+2 studded leather*and
wielding *+1 [ghost
touch](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-ghost-touch)
greataxes* (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal
creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the
chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a
noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold
the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at
[Will](../combat.html#_will) saves or become
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for 1 round per summoned
barbarian (DC 15 + the PF chronicler's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier).

Shadowdancer

# Shadowdancer

Civilized folk have always feared the night, barring themselves
behind doors or comforting themselves with bonfires when the
shadows grow long, rightfully wary of the creatures that prowl
the darkness. Yet long ago, some learned that the best way to
conquer an enemy is to embrace it. These were the first
shadowdancers.

Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness,
where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists
of deception. Unbound by any specified morality or traditional
code, shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types
who have seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their
abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly
away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the
ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even
take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and
mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the
temptation presented by their talents with deception and
infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.

**Role**: Shadowdancers adventure for a wide variety of reasons.
Many adventuring parties find shadowdancers valuable members of
their teams due to their incredible stealth and ability to
surprise enemies with lightning-quick attacks where they're least
expected. For this reason, their services are often sought out by
those groups in need of scouts or spies.

**Alignment**: Because of their nature as visually duplicitous
tricksters, shadowdancers do not fit comfortably into the lawful
category, as many use their talents to avoid the eyes of
legitimate authority. Yet though they are allies of darkness,
shadowdancers are neither inherently evil nor predisposed to
good. To them, the darkness is simply the darkness, without any
of the usual moral connotations made by the unenlightened.

**Hit Die**: d8.

## Requirements

To qualify to become a shadowdancer, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

**Skills**: [Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) 5 ranks,
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) (dance) 2 ranks.

**Feats**: [Combat Reflexes](../feats.html#_combat-reflexes),
[Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge),
[Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility).

## Class Skills

The shadowdancer's class skills (and the key ability for each
skill) are [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics)
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff)

## Class Features

All of the following are features of the shadowdancer prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Shadowdancers are proficient
with the club, crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any
type), dart, mace, morningstar, quarterstaff, rapier, sap,
shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Shadowdancers
are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

**Hide in Plain Sight (Su)**: A shadowdancer can use the
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) skill even while being
observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim
light, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open
without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however,
hide in her own shadow.

**Evasion (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains evasion. If
exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving throw for half damage,
she takes no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion
ability can only be used if the shadowdancer is wearing light
armor or no armor.

**Darkvision (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer gains
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) out to a range of 60
feet. If she already has
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision), the range increases
by 30 feet.

**Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a shadowdancer cannot be
caught [flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed), even if the
attacker is [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible). He still
loses her [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if immobilized. An shadowdancer
with this ability can still lose his
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if an opponent successfully
uses the feint action against him.

If a shadowdancer already has uncanny dodge from a different
class, he automatically gains [improved uncanny
dodge](#improved-uncanny-dodge-shadow-dancer) instead.

**Rogue Talent**: At 3rd level, and every three levels
thereafter, a shadowdancer gains a special ability that allows
her to confound her foes. This functions as the [rogue
talent](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue-talents) class feature. A
shadowdancer cannot select an individual talent more than once.
If a shadowdancer has the [advanced
talents](../classes/rogue.html#_advanced-talents) rogue class
feature, she can chose from the [advanced
talents](../classes/rogue.html#_advanced-talents) list instead.

**Shadow Illusion** **(Sp)**: When a shadowdancer reaches 3rd
level, she can create visual illusions. This ability functions as
*[silent image](../spells/silentImage.html#_silent-image),* using
the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A shadowdancer can
use this ability once per day for every two shadowdancer levels
she has attained. The DC for this ability is
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based.

**Summon Shadow (Su)**: At 3rd level, a shadowdancer can summon a
shadow, an undead shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow's
alignment matches that of the shadowdancer, and the creature
cannot create spawn. The summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on
[Will](../combat.html#_will) saves made to halve the damage from
positive channeled energy and the shadow cannot be turned or
commanded. This shadow serves as a companion to the shadowdancer
and can communicate intelligibly with the shadowdancer. This
shadow has a number of [hit points](../combat.html#_hit-points)
equal to half the shadowdancer's total. The shadow uses the
shadowdancer's base attack bonus and base save bonuses.

If a shadow companion is destroyed, or the shadowdancer chooses
to dismiss it, the shadowdancer must attempt a DC 15
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save. If the saving throw
fails, the shadowdancer gains one permanent negative level. A
successful saving throw avoids this negative level. A destroyed
or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 days.

**Shadow Call (Sp)**: At 4th level, a shadowdancer can create
creatures and effects out of raw shadow. This ability functions
as *[shadow
conjuration](../spells/shadowConjuration.html#_shadow-conjuration),*
using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A
shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 4th level, plus
one additional time per day for every two levels attained beyond
4th (2/day at 6th level, 3/day at 8th level, and 4/day at 10th
level). Upon reaching 10th level, this ability functions as
*[greater shadow
conjuration](../spells/shadowConjuration.html#_shadow-conjuration-greater)*.
The DC for this ability is
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based.

**Shadow Jump (Su)**: At 4th level, a shadowdancer gains the
ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a *[dimension
door](../spells/dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door)*spell. The
limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an
area with at least some dim light. A shadowdancer can jump up to
a total of 40 feet each day in this way; this may be a single
jump of 40 feet or four jumps of 10 feet each. Every two levels
higher than 4th, the distance a shadowdancer can jump each day
doubles (80 feet at 6th, 160 feet at 8th, and 320 feet at 10th).
This amount can be split among many jumps, but each one, no
matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

**[Defensive
Roll](../classes/rogue.html#_advanced-talents-defensive-roll)
(Ex)**: Starting at 5th level, once per day, a shadowdancer can
attempt to avoid a lethal blow. This functions as the rogue's
advanced talent of the same name.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)**: At 5th level and higher,
shadowdancer can no longer be[flanked](../combat.html#_flanking).
This defense denies a [rogue](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue) the
ability to [sneak attack](../classes/rogue.html#_sneak-attack)
the assassin by[flanking](../combat.html#_flanking) him, unless
the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target
has assassin levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the
levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to
determine the minimum [rogue](../classes/rogue.html#_rogue) level
required to[flank](../combat.html#_flanking) the character.

**Slippery Mind (Ex)**: At 7th level, a shadowdancer becomes
resilient to enchantment spells. This functions as the rogue's
advanced talent of the same name.

**Shadow Power (Sp)**: At 8th level, a shadowdancer can use raw
shadow to damage her foes. This ability functions as *[shadow
evocation](../spells/shadowEvocation.html#_shadow-evocation),*
using the shadowdancer's level as the caster level. A
shadowdancer can use this ability once per day at 8th level, and
one additional time per day upon reaching 10th level. The DC for
this ability is
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based.

**Improved Evasion (Ex)**: This ability, gained at 10th level,
works like [evasion](#evasion-shadow-dancer) (see above). A
shadowdancer takes no damage at all on successful saving throws
against attacks that allow a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex)
saving throw for half damage. What's more, she takes only half
damage even if she fails her saving throw.

**Shadow Master (Su)**: At 10th level, whenever a shadowdancer is
in an area of dim light, she gains
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 10/— and a +2 luck bonus
on all saving throws. In addition, whenever she successfully
scores a [critical hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits) against a
foe who is in an area of dim light, that foe is blinded for 1d6
rounds.
