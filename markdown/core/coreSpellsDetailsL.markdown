**Legend Lore**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** see text

**Components** V, S, M (incense worth 250 gp), F (four pieces of
ivory worth 50 gp each)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** see text

*[Legend lore]*brings to your mind legends about an
important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at
hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is
only 1d4 × 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on
the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and
the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often
provides enough information to help you find the person, place,
or thing, thus allowing a better *legend lore*result next time).
If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the
resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs
you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better *legend
lore*result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine
activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the
divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or
things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current,
legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has
never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not
of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of
thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,”
as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic
items they wield, and the places where they perform their key
deeds.

Lesser (Spell Name)

**Lesser (Spell Name)**

Any spell whose name begins with *lesser*is alphabetized
according to the spell name. Thus, the description of a
*lesser*spell appears near the description of the spell on which
it is based. Spell chains that have *lesser*spells in them
include those based on the spells
*[confusion],
[geas], [globe of
invulnerability],
[planar ally], [planar
binding],*and
*[restoration].*

Levitate

**Levitate**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a leather loop or golden wire bent into a
cup shape)

**Range** personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** you or one willing creature or one object (total
weight up to 100 lbs./level)

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Levitate*allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an
object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be
levitated*,*and an object must be unattended or possessed by a
willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move
up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move
action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the
recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example,
or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half
its base land speed).

A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon
finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1
penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum
penalty of –5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature
to begin again at –1.

Light

**Light**

**School**evocation [light]; **Level**bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, M/DF (a firefly)

**Range**touch

**Target**object touched

**Duration**10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding
normal light in a 20-foot radius, and increasing the light level
for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light
(darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light).
In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect.
The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You can only have one *light* spell active at any one time. If
you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the
previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent
* or a similar
effect), it does not count against this limit. *Light*can be used
to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell
level.

Lightning Bolt

**Lightning Bolt**

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (fur and a glass rod)

**Range** 120 ft.

**Area** 120-ft. line

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] half; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6
points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to
each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your
fingertips.

The *lightning bolt*sets fire to combustibles and damages objects
in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as
lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an
interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may
continue beyond the barrier if the spell's range permits;
otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect
does.

Limited Wish

**Limited Wish**

**School**universal; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (diamond worth 1,500 gp)

**Range**see text

**Target, Effect, Area**see text

**Duration**see text

**Saving Throw** none, see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A *limited wish*lets you create nearly any type of effect. For
example, a *limited wish*can do any of the following things.

-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower,
    provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition
    schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or
    lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your
    opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower,
    even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 4th level or
    lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Undo the harmful effects of many spells, such as or
    *[insanity]*.
-   Produce any other effect whose power level is in line with
    the above effects, such as a single creature automatically
    hitting on its next attack or taking a –7 penalty on its next
    saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and [spell
resistance] as normal, but
the save DC is for a 7th-level spell. When a *limited wish*spell
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
1,000 gp, you must provide that component (in addition to the
1,500 gp diamond component for this spell).

Liveoak

**Liveoak**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** tree touched

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell turns an oak tree into a protector or guardian. The
spell can only be cast on a single tree at a time; while
*liveoak*is in effect, you can't cast it again on another tree.
*Liveoak*must be cast on a healthy, Huge oak. A triggering phrase
of up to one word per caster level is placed on the targeted oak.
The *liveoak*spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant.

If *liveoak*is dispelled, the tree takes root immediately
wherever it happens to be. If released by you, the tree tries to
return to its original location before taking root.

Locate Creature

**Locate Creature**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Components**: V, S, M (fur from a bloodhound)

**Duration** 10 min./level

This spell functions like *[locate
object],*except this spell
locates a known creature. You slowly turn and sense when you are
facing in the direction of the creature to be located, provided
it is within range. You also know in which direction the creature
is moving, if any.

The spell can locate a creature of a specific kind or a specific
creature known to you. It cannot find a creature of a certain
type. To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a
creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once.

Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can
be fooled by *[mislead]*,
*[nondetection]*, and
*[polymorph]*spells.

Locate Object

**Locate Object**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 2, cleric 3,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a forked twig)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** circle, centered on you, with a radius of 400 ft. + 40
ft./level

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized
object. You can search for general items, in which case you
locate the nearest of its kind if more than one is within range.
Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific and
accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the
actual object, the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item
unless you have observed that particular item firsthand (not
through divination).

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures
cannot be found by this spell. *[Polymorph any
object]*and*[nondetection]*fool
it.

Longstrider

**Longstrider**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

This spell gives you a +10 foot enhancement bonus to your base
speed. It has no effect on other modes of movement, such as
burrow, climb, fly, or swim.

Lullaby

**Lullaby**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Any creature within the area that fails a
[Will] save becomes drowsy and inattentive,
taking a –5 penalty on Perception checks and a –2 penalty on
[Will] saves against
*[sleep]*effects while the *lullaby*is in
effect. *Lullaby*lasts for as long as the caster concentrates,
plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter.
