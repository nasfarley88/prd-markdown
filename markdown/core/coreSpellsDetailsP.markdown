**Passwall**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (sesame seeds)

**Range** touch

**Effect** 5-ft.-by-8-ft. opening, 10 ft. deep plus 5 ft. deep
per three additional levels

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but
not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 10
feet deep plus an additional 5 feet deep per three caster levels
above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a maximum of 25
feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than
the depth of the passage created, then a single *passwall*simply
makes a niche or short tunnel. Several *passwall*spells can then
form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When
*passwall*ends, creatures within the passage are ejected out the
nearest exit. If someone dispels the *passwall*or you dismiss it,
creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there
is one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

Permanent Image

**Permanent Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard
6

**Effect** figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube + one
10-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** permanent (D)

This spell functions like *[silent
image],*except that the figment
includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, and
the spell is permanent. By concentrating, you can move the image
within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are
not concentrating.

Persistent Image

**Persistent Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard
5

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

This spell functions like *[silent
image],*except that the figment
includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal components, and
the figment follows a script determined by you. The figment
follows that script without your having to concentrate on it. The
illusion can include intelligible speech if you wish.

Phantasmal Killer

**Phantasmal Killer**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief, then
[Fortitude] partial; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature
imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the
subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious
mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's
subject can see the *phantasmal killer*. You see only a vague
shape. The target first gets a [Will] save
to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the
phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a
[Fortitude] save or die from fear.
Even if the [Fortitude] save is
successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

If the subject of a *phantasmal killer*attack succeeds in
disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a *helm of
telepathy,*the beast can be turned upon you. You must then
disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.

Phantom Steed

**Phantom Steed**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** one quasi-real, horselike creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact
coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only
by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the
mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and
tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound.
It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not
fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount is [AC] 18 (–1 size, +4
natural armor, +5 [Dex]) and 7
hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its
hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a
speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet
at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10
pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A
mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

*8th Level*: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy
ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

*10th Level*: The mount can use *[water
walk]*at will (as the spell, no
action required to activate this ability).

*12th Level*: The mount can use *[air
walk]*at will (as the spell, no action
required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time,
after which it falls to the ground.

*14th Level*: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly
skill checks equal to your caster level.

Phantom Trap

**Phantom Trap**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (special dust worth 50 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Duration** permanent (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be
trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon
any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork,
cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses
any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real
trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing
happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to
frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

If another *phantom trap*is active within 50 feet when the spell
is cast, the casting fails.

Phase Door

**Phase Door**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** touch

**Effect** ethereal 5-ft.-by-8-ft. opening, 10 ft. deep + 5 ft.
deep per three levels

**Duration** one usage per two levels

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell creates an ethereal passage through wooden, plaster,
or stone walls, but not other materials. The *phase door*is
[invisible] and inaccessible to all
creatures except you, and only you can use the passage. You
disappear when you enter the *phase door*and appear when you
exit. If you desire, you can take one other creature (Medium or
smaller) through the door. This counts as two uses of the door.
The door does not allow light, sound, or spell effects through
it, nor can you see through it without using it. Thus, the spell
can provide an escape route, though certain creatures, such as
phase spiders, can follow with ease. A *gem of [true
seeing]*or similar magic reveals
the presence of a *phase door*but does not allow its use.

A *phase door*is subject to *[dispel
magic].*If anyone is within the
passage when it is dispelled, he is harmlessly ejected just as if
he were inside a *[passwall]*effect.

You can allow other creatures to use the *phase door*by setting
some triggering condition for the door. Such conditions can be as
simple or elaborate as you desire. They can be based on a
creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be
based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as
level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

*Phase door*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Planar Ally

**Planar Ally**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text for *[lesser planar
ally]*]; **Level** cleric 6

**Components** V, S, M (offerings worth 1,250 gp plus payment),
DF

**Effect** one or two called outsiders, totaling no more than 12
HD, which cannot be more than 30 ft. apart when they appear

This spell functions like *[lesser planar
ally]*, except you may call a single
creature of 12 HD or less, or two creatures of the same kind
whose HD total no more than 12. The creatures agree to help you
and request your return payment together.

**Planar Ally, Greater**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text for *[lesser planar
ally]*]; **Level** cleric 8

**Components** V, S, M (offerings worth 2,500 gp plus payment),
DF

**Effect** up to three called outsiders, totaling no more than 18
HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when they
appear.

This spell functions like *[lesser planar
ally]*, except that you may call a single
creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the same
kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. The creatures agree to
help you and request your return payment together.

**Planar Ally, Lesser**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (offerings worth 500 gp plus payment, see
text), DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** one called outsider of 6 HD or less

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an
outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no
particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a
creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an
individual creature's name, you may request that individual by
speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a
different creature anyway).

You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a
payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the
complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called
in order to bargain for its services.

The creature called requires a payment for its services. This
payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic
items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the
creature, to some other action on your part that matches the
creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be
made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The
bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature
begin in the round after it arrives.

A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment
of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to
1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500
gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster
level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.

A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment,
while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift.
Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal
(remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed,
unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly
aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the
payment.

At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for
expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting
back to you, if appropriate and possible).

*Note*: When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic,
earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell
of that type.

Planar Binding

**Planar Binding**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text for *[lesser planar
binding]*]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Components**: V, S

**Targets** up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more
than 12 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when
they appear

This spell functions like *[lesser planar
binding],*except that you may call a
single creature of 12 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the
same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 12. Each creature
gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and
must be individually persuaded to aid you.

**Planar Binding, Greater**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text for *[lesser planar
binding]*]; **Level**: sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components**: V, S

**Targets** up to three elementals or outsiders, totaling no more
than 18 HD, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart when
they appear.

This spell functions like *[lesser planar
binding],*except that you may call a
single creature of 18 HD or less, or up to three creatures of the
same kind whose Hit Dice total no more than 18. Each creature
gets a saving throw, makes an independent attempt to escape, and
must be individually persuaded to aid you.

**Planar Binding, Lesser**

**School** conjuration (calling) [see text]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text

**Target** one elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** no and yes; see
text

Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature
from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must
lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the
trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its
freedom.

To create the trap, you must use a *magic circle*spell, focused
inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and
stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use
that individual's proper name in casting the spell.

The target creature is allowed a [Will]
saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists
the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately
drawn to the trap ([spell
resistance] does not keep it
from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by
successfully pitting its [spell
resistance] against your
caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful
[Charisma] check (DC 15 +
1/2 your caster level + your
[Charisma] modifier). It
can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee
or attack you. A *[dimensional
anchor]*cast on the
creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also
employ a calling diagram (see *[magic circle against
evil]*)
to make the trap more secure.

If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it
bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the
creature to perform a service by describing the service and
perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a
[Charisma] check opposed by
the creature's [Charisma]
check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the
nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the
opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the
like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This
process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve,
until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by
means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable
commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the
[Charisma] check, the
creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or
attack you.

Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only
to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The
creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended
task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions,
the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster
level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free
(with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note
that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth,
evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of
that type.

Plane Shift

**Plane Shift**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** cleric 5,
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane
of travel)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures
joining hands

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of
existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link
hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the
*[plane shift]*at the same time. Precise accuracy
as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh
impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other
plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended
destination. *[Plane shift]*transports creatures
instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other
means if they are to travel back (including casting *[plane
shift]* again).

Plant Growth

**Plant Growth**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** see text

**Target or Area** see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

*Plant growth*has different effects depending on the version
chosen.

*Overgrowth*: This effect causes normal vegetation (grasses,
briars, bushes, creepers, thistles, trees, vines, and so on)
within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per caster level) to become
thick and overgrown. The plants entwine to form a thicket or
jungle that creatures must hack or force a way through. Speed
drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet for Large or larger creatures. The
area must have brush and trees in it for this spell to take
effect. If this spell is cast on an area that is already affected
by any spell or effect that enhances plants, such as
*[entangle]* or *[wall of
thorns],*any DC involved with
these spells is increased by 4. This bonus is granted for 1 day
after the casting of *plant growth.*

At your option, the area can be a 100-foot-radius circle, a
150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter circle.

You may designate places within the area that are not affected.

*Enrichment*: This effect targets plants within a range of a
half-mile, raising their potential productivity over the course
of the next year to one-third above normal.

*Plant growth*counters *[diminish
plants]*.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

Plant Shape

**Plant Shape I**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 5

plan to assume)

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 min./level (D)

When you cast this spell you can assume the form of any Small or
Medium creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any
of the following abilities, you gain the listed ability:
[darkvision] 60 feet, [low-light
vision], constrict, grab, and
poison. If the form you assume does not possess the ability to
move, your speed is reduced to 5 feet and you lose all other
forms of movement. If the creature has vulnerability to an
element, you gain that vulnerability.

*Small plant*: If the form you take is that of a Small plant, you
gain a +2 size bonus to your
[Constitution] and a +2
natural armor bonus.

*Medium plant*: If the form you take is that of a Medium plant,
you gain a +2 size bonus to your
[Strength], a +2 enhancement
bonus to your
[Constitution], and a +2
natural armor bonus.

**Plant Shape II**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as *[plant shape I]* except
that it also allows you to assume the form of a Large creature of
the plant type. If the creature has immunity or resistance to any
elements, you gain resistance 20 to those elements. If the
creature has vulnerability to an element, you gain that
vulnerability.

*Large plant*: If the form you take is that of a Large plant, you
gain a +4 size bonus to your
[Strength], a +2 size bonus to
your [Constitution], and a
+4 natural armor bonus.

**Plant Shape III**

creature of the plant type. If the form you assume has any of the
following abilities, you gain the listed ability:
[DR], regeneration 5, and
trample.

*Huge plant*: If the form you take is that of a Huge plant, you
gain a +8 size bonus to your
[Strength], a –2 penalty to
your [Dexterity], a +4 size
bonus to your
[Constitution], and a +6
natural armor bonus.

Poison

**Poison**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 4, druid 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous; see text

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect
the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee
touch attack. This poison deals 1d3
[Constitution] damage per
round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a
[Fortitude] save each round to negate
the damage and end the affliction.

Polar Ray

**Polar Ray**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a white ceramic cone or prism)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand.
You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal
damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per
caster level (maximum 25d6) and 1d4 points of
[Dexterity] drain.

Polymorph Any Object

**Polymorph Any Object**

**School** transmutation (polymorph); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature, or one nonmagical object of up to 100
cu. ft./level

**Duration** see text

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates
(object); see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (object)

This spell functions like *[greater
polymorph],*except that it
changes one object or creature into another. You can use this
spell to transform all manner of objects and creatures into new
forms—you aren't limited to transforming a living creature into
another living form. The duration of the spell depends on how
radical a change is made from the original state to its
transmuted state. The duration is determined by using the
following guidelines.

If the target of the spell does not have physical ability scores
([Strength],
[Dexterity], or
[Constitution]), this spell
grants a base score of 10 to each missing ability score. If the
target of the spell does not have mental ability scores
([Intelligence],
[Wisdom], or
[Charisma])*,* this spell
grants a score of 5 to such scores. Damage taken by the new form
can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed creature. In
general, damage occurs when the new form is changed through
physical force. A nonmagical object cannot be made into a magic
item with this spell. Magic items aren't affected by this spell.

This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value, such
as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, platinum, mithral, or
adamantine. It also cannot reproduce the special properties of
cold iron in order to overcome the [damage

This spell transforms a willing creature into an animal, humanoid
or elemental of your choosing; the spell has no effect on
unwilling creatures, nor can the creature being targeted by this
spell influence the new form assumed (apart from conveying its
wishes, if any, to you verbally).

If you use this spell to cause the target to take on the form of
an animal or magical beast, the spell functions as *[beast shape
II]*. If the form is that of an
elemental, the spell functions as *[elemental body
I].*If the form is that of
a humanoid, the spell functions as *[alter
self]*. The subject may choose to
resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the
spell for that subject.

**Polymorph, Greater**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as *[polymorph]* except that it
allows the creature to take on the form of a dragon or plant
creature. If you use this spell to cause the target to take on
the form of an animal or magical beast, it functions as *[beast
shape IV]*. If the form is that
of an elemental, the spell functions as *[elemental body
III].*If the form is that
of a humanoid, the spell functions as *[alter
self]*. If the form is that of a
plant, the spell functions as *[plant shape
II].*If the form is that of a
dragon, the spell functions as *[form of the dragon
I].*The subject may
choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so
ends the spell.

Prestidigitation

**Prestidigitation**

**School** universal; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 10 ft.

**Target, Effect, or Area**see text

**Duration** 1 hour

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use
for practice. Once cast, a *prestidigitation*spell enables you to
perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor
and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1
pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot
cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of
nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the
concentration of spellcasters. *Prestidigitation*can create small
objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials
created by a *prestidigitation*spell are extremely fragile, and
they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
Finally, *prestidigitation*lacks the power to duplicate any other
spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just
moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

Prismatic Sphere

**Prismatic Sphere**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Components**: V

**Range** 10 ft.

**Effect** 10-ft.-radius sphere centered on you

This spell functions like *[prismatic
wall],*except you conjure up
an immobile, opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light that
surrounds you and protects you from all forms of attack. The
sphere flashes in all colors of the visible spectrum.

The sphere's *blindness*effect on creatures with less than 8 HD
lasts 2d4 × 10 minutes.

You can pass into and out of the *prismatic sphere*and remain
near it without harm. When you're inside it, however, the sphere
blocks any attempt to project something through the sphere
(including spells). Other creatures that attempt to attack you or
pass through suffer the effects of each color, one at a time.

Typically, only the upper hemisphere of the globe exists, since
you are at the center of the sphere, so the lower half is usually
occluded by the floor surface you are standing on.

The colors of the sphere have the same effects as the colors of a
*[prismatic wall].*

*Prismatic sphere*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Prismatic Spray

**Prismatic Spray**

**School** evocation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

This spell causes seven shimmering, multicolored beams of light
to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power.
Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are
automatically [blinded] for 2d4
rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or
more beams, which have additional effects.

Prismatic Wall

**Prismatic Wall**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect**wall 4 ft./level wide, 2 ft./level high

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** see text

*Prismatic wall*creates a vertical, opaque wall—a shimmering,
multicolored plane of light that protects you from all forms of
attack. The wall flashes with seven colors, each of which has a
distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and you can
pass through and remain near the wall without harm. Any other
creature with less than 8 HD that is within 20 feet of the wall
is [blinded] by the colors for 2d4
rounds if it looks at the wall.

The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per caster level
and 2 feet high per caster level. A *prismatic wall*spell cast to
materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted, and
the spell is wasted.

Each color in the wall has a special effect. The accompanying
table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they
appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack you or pass
through the wall, and the magic needed to negate each color.

The wall can be destroyed, color by color, in consecutive order,
by casting the specified spells on the wall; however, the first
color must be brought down before the second can be affected, and
so on. A *[rod of
cancellation]*or a
*[mage's
disjunction]*spell
destroys a *prismatic wall*, but an *[antimagic
field]*fails to penetrate
it. *[Dispel magic]*and *greater
dispel magic*can only be used on the wall once all the other
colors have been destroyed. [Spell
resistance] is effective
against a *prismatic wall*, but the caster level check must be
repeated for each color present.

*Prismatic wall*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

might render some colors ineffective (see above).

Produce Flame

**Produce Flame**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** flame in your palm

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames
harm neither you nor your equipment.

In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled
or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a melee
touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per
caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames
up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with
a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same
damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames
than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces
the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the
remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the
attack resolves.

This spell does not function underwater.

Programmed Image

**Programmed Image**

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard
6

**Components** V, S, M (fleece and jade dust worth 25 gp)

**Effect** visual figment that cannot extend beyond a 20-ft. cube
+ one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** permanent until triggered, then 1 round/level

This spell functions like *[silent
image],*except that this spell's
figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment
includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements,
including intelligible speech.

You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word)
when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can
be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be
based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The
trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to
the senses, such as alignment. See *magic mouth*for more details
about such triggers.

Project Image

**Project Image**

**School** illusion (shadow); **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a small replica of you worth 5 gp)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** one shadow duplicate

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] disbelief (if
interacted with); **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real,
illusory version of yourself. The projected image looks, sounds,
and smells like you but is intangible. The projected image mimics
your actions (including speech) unless you direct it to act
differently (which is a move action).

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you
were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch
from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free
action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered
[blinded] and
[deafened].

If you desire, any spell you cast whose range is touch or greater
can originate from the projected image instead of from you. The
projected image can't cast any spells on itself except for
illusion spells. The spells affect other targets normally,
despite originating from the projected image.

Objects are affected by the projected image as if they had
succeeded on their [Will] save. You must
maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. If
your line of effect is obstructed, the spell ends. If you use
*[dimension door],
[teleport], [plane
shift],*or a similar spell that
breaks your line of effect, even momentarily, the spell ends.

Protection from Arrows

**Protection from Arrows**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a piece of tortoiseshell or turtle shell)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until discharged

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The
subject gains [damage
reduction] 10/magic against
ranged weapons. This spell doesn't grant you the ability to
damage creatures with similar [damage
reduction]. Once the spell
has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level
(maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

Protection from Chaos

**Protection from Chaos**

**School** abjuration [lawful]; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

This spell functions like *[protection from
evil]*, except
that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made
by chaotic creatures. The target receives a new saving throw
against control by chaotic creatures and chaotic summoned
creatures cannot touch the target.

Protection from Energy

**Protection from Energy**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level or until discharged

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

*Protection from energy*grants temporary immunity to the type of
energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity,
fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster
level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th
level), it is discharged.

*Protection from energy*overlaps (and does not stack with)
*[resist energy].*If a
character is warded by *protection from energy*and *[resist
energy],*the *protection*spell
absorbs damage until its power is
[exhausted].

Protection from Evil

**Protection from Evil**

**School** abjuration [good]; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** no;
see text

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from
mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical
barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier
moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to
[AC] and a +2 resistance bonus on
saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects
created by evil creatures.

Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if
one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that
possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including
enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects,
such as *charm person*, *command*, and *dominate person*. This
saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as
the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed
for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the
duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this
spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or
exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not
expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster
using
*[magic]*[]*[jar]*),
but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second
effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil
creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned
creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such
creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks
require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are
not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against
contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes
an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the
blocked creature. [Spell
resistance] can allow a
creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded
creature.

Protection from Good

**Protection from Good**

**School** abjuration [evil]; **Level** cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard
1

This spell functions like *[protection from
evil]*, except
that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made
by good creatures. The target receives a new saving throw against
control by good creatures and good summoned creatures cannot
touch the target.

Protection from Law

**Protection from Law**

**School** abjuration [chaotic]; **Level** cleric 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

This spell functions like *[protection from
evil]*, except
that the deflection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks made
by lawful creatures. The target receives a new saving throw
against control by lawful creatures and lawful summoned creatures
cannot touch the target.

Protection from Spells

**Protection from Spells**

**School** abjuration; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (diamond worth 500 gp), F (One 1,000 gp
diamond per target. Each subject must carry the gem for the
duration of the spell. If a subject loses the gem, the spell
ceases to affect him.)

**Range** touch

**Targets** up to one creature touched per four levels

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The subject gains a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against
spells and spell-like abilities (but not against supernatural and
extraordinary abilities).

Prying Eyes

**Prying Eyes**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of crystal marbles)

**Range** 1 mile

**Effect** 10 or more levitating eyes

**Duration** 1 hour/level; see text (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called
“eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out,
scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the
spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all
directions.

While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and
difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size
of a small apple, that has 1 hit point,
[AC] 18 (+8 bonus for its size),
flies at a speed of 30 feet with a +20 bonus on Fly skill checks
and a +16 bonus on Stealth skill checks. It has a Perception
modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject
to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect
your ability to receive visual information about your
surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by
touch.

When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them
to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. Any knowledge
you possess is known by the eyes as well.

In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your
hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its
existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded
images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.

If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly
ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you
won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of
range or because of some other event.

The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they
return to you. *[Dispel
magic]*can destroy eyes. Roll
separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if
an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar
obstacle and destroy itself.

**Prying Eyes, Greater**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions like *[prying eyes],*except
that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if
they had *[true seeing]*with a
range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at
normal speed. Also, a *greater prying eye*'s maximum Perception
modifier is +25 instead of +15.

Purify Food and Drink

**Purify Food and Drink**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 0, druid 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 10 ft.

**Target** 1 cu. ft./level of contaminated food and water

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, diseased, poisonous, or
otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for
eating and drinking. This spell does not prevent subsequent
natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and
drink of significance is spoiled by *purify food and drink,*but
the spell has no effect on creatures of any type nor upon magic
potions. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot
of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

Pyrotechnics

**Pyrotechnics**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (one fire source)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target** one fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube

**Duration** 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave
the smoke cloud; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates or
[Fortitude] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes or
no; see text

*Pyrotechnics*turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or
a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The
spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A
fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly
extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a
fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per
caster level.

*Fireworks*: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst
of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures
within 120 feet of the fire source to become
[blinded] for 1d4+1 rounds
([Will] negates). These creatures must have
line of sight to the fire to be affected. [Spell
resistance] can prevent
blindness.

*Smoke Cloud*: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire,
forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions
and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even
[darkvision], is ineffective in or
through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to
[Strength] and
[Dexterity]
([Fortitude] negates). These effects
last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the
creature leaves the area of the cloud. [Spell
resistance] does not apply.
