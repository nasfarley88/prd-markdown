## Barbarian

For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the
fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all
these brutal souls know.  Savages, hired muscle, masters of
vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional
warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter
and spirits of war.  Known as barbarians, these warmongers know
little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for
them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before
them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their
death.  They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the
endurance to weather all that might entail.  These brutal
warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and
savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam
the wild places of the world.  Within barbarians storms the
primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

**Role**: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial
prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to
themselves.  With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond
that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into
battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.

**Alignment**: Any nonlawful.

**Hit Die**: d12.

  : Table: Barbarian

### Barbarian Class Features 

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A barbarian is proficient with
all [simple] and [martial] weapons, light armor, medium armor,
and shields (except tower shields).

**Fast Movement**: A barbarian's land speed is faster than the
norm for her race by +10 feet.  This benefit applies only when she
is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not
carrying a heavy load.  Apply this bonus before modifying the
barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.  This
bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's land
speed.

**Rage**: A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength
and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess.  Starting at
1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day
equal to 4 + her [Constitution] modifier.  At each level after
1st, she can rage for 2 additional rounds.  Temporary increases to
[Constitution], such as those gained from rage and spells like
*[bear's endurance],* do not increase the total number of rounds
that a barbarian can rage per day.  A barbarian can enter rage as
a free action.  The total number of rounds of rage per day is
renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not
need to be consecutive.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her
[Strength] and [Constitution], as well as a +2 morale bonus on
[Will saves].  In addition, she takes a –2 penalty to [Armor
Class].  The increase to [Constitution] grants the barbarian 2 hit
points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and
are not lost first like [temporary hit points].  While in rage, a
barbarian cannot use any [Charisma]-, [Dexterity]-, or
[Intelligence]-based skills , [Fly], [Intimidate], and [Ride]) or
any ability that requires patience or concentration.

A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is [fatigued]
after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of
rounds spent in the rage.  A barbarian cannot enter a new rage
while [fatigued] or [exhausted] but can otherwise enter rage
multiple times during a single encounter or combat.  If a
barbarian falls [unconscious], her rage immediately ends, placing
her in peril of death.

**Rage Powers**: As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use
her rage in new ways.  Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a
rage power.  She gains another rage power for every two levels of
barbarian attained after 2nd level.  A barbarian gains the
benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these
powers require the barbarian to take an action first.  Unless
otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power
more than once.

*Animal Fury*: While raging, the barbarian gains a bite
attack.  If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack
is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus –5.  If the bite
hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming the barbarian is
Medium; 1d3 points of damage if Small) plus half the barbarian's
[Strength] modifier.  A barbarian can make a bite attack as part
of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple.  This
attack is resolved before the grapple check is made.  If the bite
attack hits, any grapple checks made by the barbarian against the
target this round are at a +2 bonus.

*Clear Mind**: A barbarian may reroll a failed [Will save].
*This power is used as an immediate action after the first save
*is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM.  The
*barbarian must take the second result, even if it is worse.  A
*barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this
*power.  This power can only be used once per rage.

*Fearless Rage*: While raging, the barbarian is immune to the
[shaken] and [frightened] conditions.  A barbarian must be at
least 12th level before selecting this rage power.

*Guarded Stance**: The barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus] to
*her [Armor Class] against melee attacks for a number of rounds
*equal to the barbarian's current [Constitution] modifier .  This
*bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has
*attained.  Activating this ability is a move action that does not
*provoke an [attack of opportunity].

*Increased Damage Reduction**: The barbarian's [damage
*reduction] increases by 1/—.  This increase is always active
*while the barbarian is raging.  A barbarian can select this rage
*power up to three times.  Its effects stack.  A barbarian must be
*at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

*Internal Fortitude*: While raging, the barbarian is immune to
the [sickened] and [nauseated] conditions.  A barbarian must be at
least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

*Intimidating Glare**: The barbarian can make an [Intimidate]
*check against one adjacent foe as a move action.  If the
*barbarian successfully demoralizes her opponent, the foe is
*[shaken] for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which
*the barbarian's check exceeds the DC.

*Knockback**: Once per round, the barbarian can make a [bull
*rush] attempt against one target in place of a melee attack.  If
*successful, the target takes damage equal to the barbarian's
*[Strength] modifier and is moved back as normal.  The barbarian
*does not need to move with the target if successful.  This does
*not provoke an [attack of opportunity].

*Low-Light Vision**: The barbarian's senses sharpen and she
*gains [low-light vision] while raging.

*Mighty Swing**: The barbarian automatically confirms a
*[critical hit].  This power is used as an immediate action once a
*critical threat has been determined.  A barbarian must be at
*least 12th level before selecting this power.  This power can
*only be used once per rage.

*Moment of Clarity**: The barbarian does not gain any benefits
*or take any of the penalties from rage for 1 round.  Activating
*this power is a swift action.  This includes the penalty to
*[Armor Class] and the restriction on what actions can be
*performed.  This round still counts against her total number of
*rounds of rage per day.  This power can only be used once per
*rage.

*Night Vision**: The barbarian's senses grow incredibly sharp
*while raging and she gains [darkvision] 60 feet.  A barbarian
*must have [low-light vision] as a rage power or a racial trait
*to select this rage power.

*No Escape*: The barbarian can move up to double her normal
speed as an immediate action but she can only use this ability
when an adjacent foe uses a [withdraw action] to move away from
her.  She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used
the [withdraw action].  The barbarian provokes attacks of
opportunity as normal during this movement.  This power can only
be used once per rage.

*Powerful Blow*: The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on a single
damage roll.  This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the
barbarian has attained.  This power is used as a swift action
before the roll to hit is made.  This power can only be used once
per rage.

*Quick Reflexes*: While raging, the barbarian can make one
additional [attack of opportunity] per round.

*Raging Climber*: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as
an enhancement bonus on all [Climb] [skill checks].

*Raging Leaper*: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as
an enhancement bonus on all [Acrobatics] [skill checks] made to
jump.  When making a jump in this way, the barbarian is always
considered to have a running start.

*Raging Swimmer*: When raging, the barbarian adds her level as
an enhancement bonus on all [Swim] [skill checks].

*Renewed Vigor**: As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8
*points of damage + her [Constitution] modifier.  For every four
*levels the barbarian has attained above 4th, this amount of
*damage healed increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 20th
*level.  A barbarian must be at least 4th level before selecting
*this power.  This power can be used only once per day and only
*while raging.

*Rolling Dodge*: The barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus] to her
[Armor Class] against ranged attacks for a number of rounds equal
to the barbarian's current [Constitution] modifier .  This bonus
increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has
attained.  Activating this ability is a move action that does not
provoke an [attack of opportunity].

*Roused Anger**: The barbarian may enter a rage even if
*[fatigued].  While raging after using this ability, the barbarian
*is immune to the [fatigued] condition.  Once this rage ends, the
*barbarian is [exhausted] for 10 minutes per round spent raging.

*Scent* *[*: The barbarian gains the [scent] ability while raging
and can use this ability to locate unseen foes (see [Special
Abilities] for rules on the [scent] ability).

*Strength Surge**: The barbarian adds her barbarian level on
*one [Strength] check or [combat maneuver check], or to her
*[Combat Maneuver Defense] when an opponent attempts a maneuver
*against her.  This power is used as an immediate action.  This
*power can only be used once per rage.

*Superstition*: The barbarian gains a +2 morale bonus on
[saving throws] made to resist spells, supernatural abilities,
and spell-like abilities.  This bonus increases by +1 for every 4
levels the barbarian has attained.  While raging, the barbarian
cannot be a willing target of any spell and must make [saving
throws] to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.

*Surprise Accuracy**: The barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on
*one attack roll.  This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels
*the barbarian has attained.  This power is used as a swift
*action before the roll to hit is made.  This power can only be
*used once per rage.

*Swift Foot**: The barbarian gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus
*to her speed.  This increase is always active while the barbarian
*is raging.  A barbarian can select this rage power up to three
*times.  Its effects stack.

*Terrifying Howl**: The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl
*as a standard action.  All [shaken] enemies within 30 feet must
*make a [Will save] (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level +
*the barbarian's [Strength] modifier) or be [panicked] for 1d4+1
*rounds.  Once an enemy has made a save versus terrifying howl ,
*it is immune to this power for 24 hours.  A barbarian must have
*the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power.  A
*barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this
*power.

*Unexpected Strike*: The barbarian can make an [attack of
opportunity] against a foe that moves into any square threatened
by the barbarian, regardless of whether or not that movement
would normally provoke an [attack of opportunity].  This power can
only be used once per rage.  A barbarian must be at least 8th
level before selecting this power.

**Uncanny Dodge**: At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability
to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to
do so.  She cannot be caught [flat-footed], even if the attacker
is [invisible].  She still loses her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if
immobilized.  A barbarian with this ability can still lose her
[Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an opponent successfully uses the
feint action against her.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class,
she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

**Trap Sense**: At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on
[Reflex saves] made to avoid traps and a +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC]
against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses increase by +1
every three barbarian levels thereafter .  Trap sense bonuses
gained from multiple classes stack.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge**: At 5th level and higher, a
barbarian can no longer be flanked.  This defense denies a rogue
the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless
the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target
has barbarian levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another
class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
character.

**Damage Reduction**: At 7th level, a barbarian gains [damage
reduction].  Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each
time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack.  At
10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter , this
[damage reduction] rises by 1 point.  [Damage reduction] can
reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

**Greater Rage**: At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage,
the morale bonus to her [Strength] and [Constitution] increases
to +6 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves] increases to +3.

**Indomitable Will**: While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level
or higher gains a +4 bonus on [Will saves] to resist enchantment
spells.  This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including
the morale bonus on [Will saves] she also receives during her
rage.

**Tireless Rage**: Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no
longer becomes [fatigued] at the end of her rage.

**Mighty Rage**: At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage,
the morale bonus to her [Strength] and [Constitution] increases
to +8 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves] increases to +4.

### Ex-Barbarians

A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and
cannot gain more levels as a barbarian.  She retains all other
benefits of the class.

## Bard

Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to
discover them.  Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these
cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the
arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration.  Typically
masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an
uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they
learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of
danger.  Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills
might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or
jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or
scoundrels, or even all of the above.  For bards, every day brings
its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by
bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they
claim the treasures of each.

**Role**: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while
inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring.  While accomplished
with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies
outside melee, where they can support their companions and
undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their
performances.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Bard Class Features 

All of the following are class features of the bard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A bard is proficient with all
[simple] weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword,
shortbow, and whip.  Bards are also proficient with light armor
and shields .  A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light
armor and use a shield without incurring the normal arcane spell
failure chance.  Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing
medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if
the spell in question has a somatic component.  A multiclass bard
still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane
spells received from other classes.

**Spells**: A bard casts arcane spells drawn from the [bard spell
list] presented in [Spell Lists].  He can cast any spell he knows
without preparing it ahead of time.  Every bard spell has a
[verbal component] (song, recitation, or music).  To learn or cast
a spell, a bard must have a [Charisma] score equal to at least 10
+ the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw]
against a bard's spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard's
[Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell
allotment is given on [Table: Bard].  In addition, he receives
bonus spells per day if he has a high [Charisma] score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited.  A bard
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells
of the bard's choice.  At each new bard level, he gains one or
more new spells, as indicated on [Table: Bard Spells
Known].  (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows
is not affected by his [Charisma] score.  The numbers on [Table:
Bard Spells Known] are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that
, a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he
already knows.  In effect, the bard “loses” the old spell in
exchange for the new one.  The new spell's level must be the same
as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least one
level lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can
cast.  A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level and
must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time
that he gains new spells known for the level.

A bard need not prepare his spells in advance.  He can cast any
spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his
allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

**Bardic Knowledge**: A bard adds half his class level to all
[Knowledge] [skill checks] and may make all [Knowledge] [skill
checks] untrained.

**Bardic Performance**: A bard is trained to use the [Perform]
skill to create magical effects on those around him, including
himself if desired.  He can use this ability for a number of
rounds per day equal to 4 + his [Charisma] modifier.  At each
level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2
additional rounds per day.  Each round, the bard can produce any
one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as
indicated by his level.

Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be
maintained each round as a free action.  Changing a bardic
performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop
the previous performance and start a new one as a standard
action.  A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends
immediately if the bard is killed, [paralyzed], [stunned],
knocked [unconscious], or otherwise prevented from taking a free
action to maintain it each round.  A bard cannot have more than
one bardic performance in effect at one time.

At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move
action instead of a standard action.  At 13th level, a bard can
start a bardic performance as a swift action.

Each bardic performance has audible components, visual
components, or both.

If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must
be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect,
and such performances are language dependent.  A deaf bard has a
20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance
with an audible component.  If he fails this check, the attempt
still counts against his daily limit.  Deaf creatures are immune
to bardic performances with audible components.

If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must
have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any
effect.  A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to
use a bardic performance with a visual component.  If he fails
this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual
components.

*Countersong*: At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic
effects that depend on sound .  Each round of the countersong he
makes a [Perform] (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing)
skill check.  Any creature within 30 feet of the bard that is
affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use
the bard's [Perform] check result in place of its [saving throw]
if, after the [saving throw] is rolled, the [Perform] check
result proves to be higher.  If a creature within range of the
countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous
sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another
[saving throw] against the effect each round it hears the
countersong, but it must use the bard's [Perform] skill check
result for the save.  Countersong does not work on effects that
don't allow saves.  Countersong relies on audible components.

*Distraction*: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to
counter magic effects that depend on sight.  Each round of the
distraction, he makes a [Perform] (act, comedy, dance, or
oratory) skill check.  Any creature within 30 feet of the bard
that is affected by an [illusion ] or [illusion ] magical attack
may use the bard's [Perform] check result in place of its [saving
throw] if, after the [saving throw] is rolled, the [Perform]
skill check proves to be higher.  If a creature within range of
the distraction is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous
[illusion ] or [illusion ] magical attack, it gains another
[saving throw] against the effect each round it sees the
distraction, but it must use the bard's [Perform] skill check
result for the save.  Distraction does not work on effects that
don't allow saves.  Distraction relies on visual components.

*Fascinate*: At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to
cause one or more creatures to become [fascinated] with him.  Each
creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and
hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him.  The bard
must also be able to see the creatures affected.  The distraction
of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from
working.  For every three levels the bard has attained beyond 1st,
he can target one additional creature with this ability.

Each creature within range receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2
the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) to negate the
effect.  If a creature's [saving throw] succeeds, the bard cannot
attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours.  If its
[saving throw] fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the
performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain
it.  While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on all [skill
checks] made as reactions, such as [Perception] checks.  Any
potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new
[saving throw] against the effect.  Any obvious threat, such as
someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at
the target, automatically breaks the effect.

Fascinate is an [enchantment ], mind-affecting ability.
Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to
function.

*Inspire Courage*: A 1st-level bard can use his performance to
inspire courage in his allies , bolstering them against fear and
improving their combat abilities.  To be affected, an ally must be
able to perceive the bard's performance.  An affected ally
receives a +1 morale bonus on [saving throws] against charm and
fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon
damage rolls.  At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter,
this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th
level.  Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.  Inspire
courage can use audible or visual components.  The bard must
choose which component to use when starting his performance.

*Inspire Competence*: A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his
performance to help an ally succeed at a task.  That ally must be
within 30 feet and be able to hear the bard.  The ally gets a +2
competence bonus on [skill checks] with a particular skill as
long as she continues to hear the bard's performance.  This bonus
increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained
beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at
19th).  Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as
[Stealth], and may be disallowed at the GM's discretion.  A bard
can't inspire competence in himself.  Inspire competence relies on
audible components.

*Suggestion*: A bard of 6th level or higher can use his
performance to make a *[suggestion]* (as per the spell) to a
creature he has already fascinated (see above).  Using this
ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does
require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free
action to continue the fascinate effect).  A bard can use this
ability more than once against an individual creature during an
individual performance.

Making a *suggestion* does not count against a bard's daily use
of bardic performance.  A [Will saving throw] (DC 10 + 1/2 the
bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) negates the
effect.  This ability affects only a single creature.
*Suggestion*is an [enchantment ], mind affecting,
language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.

*Dirge of Doom*: A bard of 8th level or higher can use his
performance to foster a sense of growing dread in his enemies,
causing them to become [shaken].  To be affected, an enemy must be
within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard's
performance.  The effect persists for as long as the enemy is
within 30 feet and the bard continues his performance.  This
performance cannot cause a creature to become [frightened] or
[panicked], even if the targets are already [shaken] from another
effect.  Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it
relies on audible and visual components.

*Inspire Greatness*: A bard of 9th level or higher can use his
performance to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing
ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability.  For
every three levels the bard attains beyond 9th, he can target an
additional ally while using this performance .  To inspire
greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the
bard.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice
(d10s), the commensurate number of [temporary hit points] (apply
the target's [Constitution] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit
Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence
bonus on [Fortitude saves].  The bonus Hit Dice count as regular
Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice
dependent.  Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it
relies on audible and visual components.

*Soothing Performance**: A bard of 12th level or higher can use
*his performance to create an effect equivalent to a *[mass cure
*serious wounds],*using the bard's level as the caster level.  In
*addition, this performance removes the [fatigued], [sickened],
*and [shaken] conditions from all those affected.  Using this
*ability requires 4 rounds of continuous performance, and the
*targets must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the
*performance.  Soothing performance affects all targets that
*remain within 30 feet throughout the performance.  Soothing
*performance relies on audible and visual components.

*Frightening Tune*: A bard of 14th level or higher can use his
performance to cause fear in his enemies.  To be affected, an
enemy must be able to hear the bard perform and be within 30
feet.  Each enemy within range receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2
the bard's level + the bard's [Cha] modifier) to negate the
effect.  If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this
ability for 24 hours.  If the save fails, the target becomes
[frightened] and flees for as long as the target can hear the
bard's performance.  Frightening tune relies on audible
components.

*Inspire Heroics**: A bard of 15th level or higher can inspire
*tremendous heroism in himself or a single ally within 30
*feet.  For every three bard levels the character attains beyond
*15th, he can inspire heroics in an additional creature.  To
*inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear
*the bard.  Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on [saving
*throws] and a +4 [dodge bonus] to [AC].  This effect lasts for as
*long as the targets are able to witness the performance.  Inspire
*heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and
*visual components.

*Mass Suggestion*: This ability functions just like
*suggestion,*but allows a bard of 18th level or higher to make a
*suggestion* simultaneously to any number of creatures that he
has already fascinated.  *Mass suggestion* is an [enchantment ],
mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible
components.

*Deadly Performance*: A bard of 20th level or higher can use
his performance to cause one enemy to die from joy or sorrow.  To
be affected, the target must be able to see and hear the bard
perform for 1 full round and be within 30 feet.  The target
receives a [Will save] (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's
[Cha] modifier) to negate the effect.  If a creature's [saving
throw] succeeds, the target is [staggered] for 1d4 rounds, and
the bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for
24 hours.  If a creature's [saving throw] fails, it dies.  Deadly
performance is a mind-affecting death effect that relies on
audible and visual components.

**Cantrips**: Bards learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, as noted on [Table: Bard Spells Known] under “Spells
Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do
not consume any slots and may be used again.

**Versatile Performance**: At 2nd level, a bard can choose one
type of [Perform] skill.  He can use his bonus in that skill in
place of his bonus in associated skills.  When substituting in
this way, the bard uses his total [Perform] skill bonus,
including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill's
bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a
class skill.  At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the
bard can select an additional type of [Perform] to substitute.

The types of [Perform] and their associated skills are: Act
([Bluff], [Disguise]), Comedy ([Bluff], [Intimidate]), Dance
([Acrobatics], [Fly]), Keyboard Instruments ([Diplomacy],
[Intimidate]), Oratory ([Diplomacy], [Sense Motive]), Percussion
([Handle Animal], [Intimidate]), Sing ([Bluff], [Sense Motive]),
String ([Bluff], [Diplomacy]), and Wind ([Diplomacy], [Handle
Animal]).

**Well-Versed**: At 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to
the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in
general.  The bard gains a +4 bonus on [saving throws] made
against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent
effects.

**Lore Master**: At 5th level, the bard becomes a master of
lore and can take 10 on any [Knowledge] skill check that he has
ranks in.  A bard can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll
normally.  In addition, once per day, the bard can take 20 on any
[Knowledge] skill check as a standard action.  He can use this
ability one additional time per day for every six levels he
possesses beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th
level.

**Jack-of-All-Trades**: At 10th level, the bard can use any
skill, even if the skill normally requires him to be trained.  At
16th level, the bard considers all skills to be class skills.  At
19th level, the bard can take 10 on any skill check, even if it
is not normally allowed.


## Cleric

In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater
purpose.  Called to serve powers beyond most mortal
understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the
spiritual needs of their people.  Clerics are more than mere
priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of
their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their
gods.  Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies
that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the
knowledge and influence of their faith.  Yet while they might
share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one
another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing
and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others
spreading conflict and corruption.  The ways of the cleric are
varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of
allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.

**Role**: More than capable of upholding the honor of their
deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable
combatants.  Their true strength lies in their capability to draw
upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own
and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with
divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need.

As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must
focus their worship upon a divine source.  While the vast
majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number
dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such
as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific
abstraction.  (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to
selecting a specific deity.)

**Alignment**: A cleric's [alignment] must be within one step of
her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil
axis.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Cleric Class Skills

The cleric's class skills are [Appraise] ([Int]), [Craft] ([Int]), [Diplomacy]

([Int]), [Knowledge] (nobility) ([Int]), [Knowledge] (planes) ([Int]),
[Knowledge] (religion) ([Int]), [Linguistics] ([Int]), [Profession] ([Wis]),
[Sense Motive] ([Wis]), and [Spellcraft] ([Int]).

### Cleric Class Features

The following are class features of the cleric.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Clerics are proficient with all
[simple] weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except
tower shields).  Clerics are also proficient with the favored
weapon of their deity.

**Aura**: A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity
has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's
[alignment] (see the *[detect evil]* spell for details).

**Spells**: A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the
[cleric spell list] presented in [Spell Lists].  Her [alignment],
however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to
her moral or ethical beliefs; see [chaotic, evil, good, and
lawful spells].  A cleric must choose and prepare her spells in
advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a [Wisdom] score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for
a [saving throw] against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level
+ the cleric's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily spell
allotment is given on [Table: Cleric].  In addition, she receives
bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom] score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells.  Each cleric must
choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet
contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of
spells.  A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric
spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but
she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily
meditation.

**Channel Energy**: Regardless of [alignment], any cleric can
release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith
through her holy symbol.  This energy can be used to cause or heal
damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the
creatures targeted.

A good cleric channels positive energy and can choose to deal
damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures.  An evil
cleric (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative
energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to
heal undead creatures.  A neutral cleric who worships a neutral
deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must
choose whether she channels positive or negative energy.  Once
this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.  This decision also
determines whether the cleric casts spontaneous cure or inflict
spells .

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of
one type in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric.  The amount
of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus
1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st .
Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a [Will
save] to halve the damage.  The DC of this save is equal to 10 +
1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's [Charisma] modifier.
Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum
hit point total—all excess healing is lost.  A cleric may channel
energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her [Charisma]
modifier.  This is a standard action that does not provoke an
[attack of opportunity].  A cleric can choose whether or not to
include herself in this effect.  A cleric must be able to present
her holy symbol to use this ability.

**Domains**: A cleric's deity influences her [alignment], what
magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her.  A
cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to her
deity.  A cleric can select an [alignment] domain only if her
[alignment] matches that domain.  If a cleric is not devoted to a
particular deity, she still selects two domains to represent her
spiritual inclinations and abilities .  The restriction on
[alignment] domains still applies.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the
level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells.  A
cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell
she can cast, from 1st on up.  Each day, a cleric can prepare one
of the spells from her two domains in that slot.  If a domain
spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it
only in her domain spell slot.  Domain spells cannot be used to
cast spells spontaneously.

In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her
domains, if she is of a high enough level.  Unless otherwise
noted, using a domain power is a standard action.  Cleric domains
are listed at the end of this class entry.

**Orisons**: Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, each day, as noted on [Table: Cleric] under “Spells per
Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are
not expended when cast and may be used again.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a
good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells
that she did not prepare ahead of time.  The cleric can “lose” any
prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to
cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure
spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).

An evil cleric can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but
can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with
“inflict” in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither
good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict
spells .  Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be
reversed.  This choice also determines whether the cleric channels
positive or negative energy (see [Channel Energy]).

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A cleric can't cast
spells of an [alignment] opposed to her own or her deity's
.  Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by
the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell
descriptions.

**Bonus Languages**: A cleric's bonus language options include
Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic
evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively).  These choices are
in addition to the bonus languages available to the character
because of her race.

### Ex-Clerics

A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by her
god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and
shield proficiencies and proficiency with [simple] weapons.  She
cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until she
atones for her deeds (see the *[atonement]* spell description).

### Domains 

Clerics may select any two of the domains granted by their deity.
Clerics without a deity may select any two domains (choice are
subject to GM approval).

### Air Domain

**Granted Powers**: You can manipulate lightning, mist, and wind,
traffic with air creatures, and are resistant to electricity
damage.

*Lightning Arc*: As a standard action, you can unleash an arc
of electricity targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack.  This arc of electricity deals 1d6 points of electricity
damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess.  You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom] modifier.

*Electricity Resistance*: At 6th level, you gain resist
electricity 10.  This resistance increases to 20 at 12th level.  At
20th level, you gain immunity to electricity.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[obscuring mist],*2nd—*[wind
wall],*3rd—*[gaseous form],*4th—*[air walk],*5th—*[control
winds],*6th—*[chain lightning],*7th—*[elemental body IV]* (air

**Granted Powers**: In strength and brawn there is truth—your
faith gives you incredible might and power.

*Strength Surge*: As a standard action, you can touch a
creature to give it great strength.  For 1 round, the target gains
an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 your cleric level to melee
attacks, combat maneuver checks that rely on [Strength],
[Strength]-based skills, and [Strength] checks.  You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom]
modifier.

*Might of the Gods*: At 8th level, you can add your cleric
level as an enhancement bonus to your [Strength] score for a
number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level.  This bonus
only applies on [Strength] checks and [Strength]-based [skill
checks].  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[enlarge person],*2nd—*[bull's

### Sun Domain

**Granted Powers**: You see truth in the pure and burning light
of the sun, and can call upon its blessing or wrath to work great
deeds.

*Sun's Blessing*: Whenever you channel positive energy to harm
undead creatures, add your cleric level to the damage
dealt.  Undead do not add their channel resistance to their saves
when you channel positive energy.

*Nimbus of Light*: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot nimbus
of light for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric
level.  This acts as a *daylight*spell.  In addition, undead within
this radius take an amount of damage equal to your cleric level
each round that they remain inside the nimbus.  Spells and
spell-like abilities with the darkness descriptor are
automatically dispelled if brought inside this nimbus.  These
rounds do not need to be consecutive.

### Travel Domain

**Granted Powers**: You are an explorer and find enlightenment in
the simple joy of travel, be it by foot or conveyance or magic.
Increase your base speed by 10 feet.

*Agile Feet*: As a free action, you can gain increased mobility
for 1 round.  For the next round, you ignore all difficult
terrain and do not take any penalties for moving through it.  You
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom] modifier.

*Dimensional Hop*: At 8th level, you can teleport up to 10
feet per cleric level per day as a move action.  This
teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity.  You must have line of
sight to your destination to use this ability.  You can bring
other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal
amount of distance for each creature brought.

### Trickery Domain

**Granted Powers**: You are a master of illusions and deceptions.
[Bluff], [Disguise], and [Stealth] are class skills.

*Copycat*: You can create an illusory double of yourself as a
move action.  This double functions as a single *mirror image* and
lasts for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level, or until
the illusory duplicate is dispelled or destroyed.  You can have no
more than one copycat at a time.  This ability does not stack with
the *mirror image* spell.  You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

*Master's Illusion*: At 8th level, you can create an illusion
that hides the appearance of yourself and any number of allies
within 30 feet for 1 round per cleric level.  This ability
otherwise functions like the spell *[veil]*.  The save DC to
disbelive this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level +
your Wisdom modifier.  The rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[disguise self],*2nd—*[invisibility],*

### War Domain

**Granted Powers**: You are a crusader for your god, always ready
and willing to fight to defend your faith.

*Battle Rage*: You can touch a creature as a standard action
to give it a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to 1/2 your cleric
level for 1 round .  You can do so a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

*Weapon Master*: At 8th level, as a swift action, you gain the
use of one combat feat for a number of rounds per day equal to
your cleric level.  These rounds do not need to be consecutive and
you can change the feat chosen each time you use this
ability.  You must meet the prerequisites to use this feat.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[magic weapon],*2nd—*[spiritual weapon],*
3rd—*[magic vestment],*4th—*[divine power],*5th—*[flame
strike],*6th—*[blade barrier],*7th—*[power word
blind],*8th—*[power word stun],*9th—*[power word kill].*

### Water Domain

**Granted Powers**: You can manipulate water and mist and ice,
conjure creatures of water, and resist cold.

*Icicle*: As a standard action, you can fire an icicle from
your finger, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack.  The icicle deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for
every two cleric levels you possess.  You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

*Cold Resistance*: At 6th level, you gain resist cold 10.  This
resistance increases to 20 at 12th level.  At 20th level, you gain
immunity to cold.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[obscuring mist],*2nd—*[fog
cloud],*3rd—*[water breathing],*4th—*[control water],*5th—*[ice
storm],*6th—*[cone of cold],*7th—*[elemental body IV]*(water

spell only).

### Weather Domain

**Granted Powers**: With power over storm and sky, you can call
down the wrath of the gods upon the world below.

*Storm Burst*: As a standard action, you can create a storm
burst targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack.  The storm burst deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1
point for every two cleric levels you possess.  In addition, the
target is buffeted by winds and rain, causing it to take a –2
penalty on attack rolls for 1 round.  You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Wisdom] modifier.

*Lightning Lord*: At 8th level, you can call down a number of
bolts of lightning per day equal to your cleric level.  You can
call down as many bolts as you want with a single standard
action, but no creature can be the target of more than one bolt
and no two targets can be more than 30 feet apart.  This ability
otherwise functions as *[call lightning]*.

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[obscuring mist],*2nd—*[fog
cloud],*3rd—*[call lightning],*4th—*[sleet storm],*5th—*[ice
storm],*6th—*[control winds],*7th—*[control

## Druid

Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds
lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization.  Furtive yet
undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of
philosophical balance known as druids.  Allies to beasts and
manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of
the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten
them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock
themselves behind city walls.  Rewarded for their devotion with
incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting
abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to
call upon nature's wrath.  The mightiest temper powers akin to
storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long
abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

**Role**: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle,
allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they
confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into
deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat.  Druids worship
personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature
itself.  Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though
druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic
demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.

**Alignment**: Any neutral.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Druid Class Features

All of the following are class features of the druid.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Druids are proficient with the
following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar,
scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear.  They are also
proficient with all natural attacks of any form they assume with
wild shape .

Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are
prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only
padded, leather, or hide armor.  A druid may also wear wooden
armor that has been altered by the *ironwood* spell so that it
functions as though it were steel.  Druids are proficient with
shields but must use only those crafted from wood.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is
unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or
spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours
thereafter.

**Spells**: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the
druid spell list presented in [Spell Lists].  Her [alignment] may
restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or
ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells.  A
druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a [Wisdom] score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for
a [saving throw] against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level
+ the druid's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Druid.  In addition, she receives
bonus spells per day if she has a high [Wisdom] score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on
the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.
A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list,
provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must
choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A druid can channel stored spell energy
into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time.  She
can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's
ally* spell of the same level or lower.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A druid can't cast
spells of an [alignment] opposed to her own or her deity's
.  Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by
the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell
descriptions.

**Orisons**: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, each day, as noted on Table: Druid under “Spells per
Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are
not expended when cast and may be used again.

**Bonus Languages**: A druid's bonus language options include
Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures.  This choice is in
addition to the bonus languages available to the character
because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to
druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid.  Druidic
is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition
to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a
language slot.  Druids are forbidden to teach this language to
nondruids.

Druidic has its own alphabet.

**Nature Bond**: At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with
nature.  This bond can take one of two forms.  The first is a close
tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following
cleric domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or
Weather.  When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by
this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her
druid level.  A druid that selects this option also receives
additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric.  She must
prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell
cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.

The second option is to form a close bond with an animal
companion.  A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed
in [Animal Choices].  This animal is a loyal companion that
accompanies the druid on her adventures.

Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit
Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances
in level.  If a character receives an animal companion from more
than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the
purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the
companion.  Most animal companions increase in size when their
druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion.  If a
druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one
by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of
prayer in the environment where the new companion typically
lives.  This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that
has perished.

**Nature Sense**: A druid gains a +2 bonus on [Knowledge]
(nature) and [Survival] checks.

**Wild Empathy**: A druid can improve the attitude of an
animal.  This ability functions just like a [Diplomacy] check made
to improve the attitude of a person (see [Using Skills]).  The
druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her [Charisma]
modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.  The typical
domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while
wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30
feet of one another under normal conditions.  Generally,
influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with
influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast
with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4
penalty on the check.

**Woodland Stride**: Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move
through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and
without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.  Thorns,
briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated
to impede motion, however, still affect her.

**Trackless Step**: Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no
trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.  She may
choose to leave a trail if so desired.

**Resist Nature's Lure**: Starting at 4th level, a druid gains
a +4 bonus on [saving throws] against the spell-like and
supernatural abilities of fey.  This bonus also applies to spells
and effects that utilize or target plants, such as *[blight],
[entangle], [spike growth],*and *[warp wood].*

**Wild Shape**: At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn
herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per
day.  Her options for new forms include all creatures with the
animal type.  This ability functions like the *[beast shape I]*
spell, except as noted here.  The effect lasts for 1 hour per
druid level, or until she changes back.  Changing form is a
standard action and doesn't provoke an [attack of
opportunity].  The form chosen must be that of an animal with
which the druid is familiar.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because
she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can
make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the
same general grouping as her new form.  (The normal sound a wild
parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not
permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th
level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times
at 18th level.  At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will.
As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on
the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants.
Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of
the form taken.

At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental.  When taking the form
of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as *[beast shape
II]*.  When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild
shape functions as *[elemental body I]*.

At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or
Medium plant creature.  When taking the form of animals, a druid's
wild shape now functions as *[beast shape III]*.  When taking the
form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as
*[elemental body II]*.  When taking the form of a plant creature,
the druid's wild shape functions as *[plant shape I]*.

At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Large elemental or a Large plant creature.  When taking the form
of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as
*[elemental body III]*.  When taking the form of a plant, the
druid's wild shape now functions as *[plant shape II]*.

At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature.  When taking the form of
an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as *[elemental
body IV]*.  When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild
shape now functions as *[plant shape III]*.

**Venom Immunity**: At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all
poisons.

**A Thousand Faces**: At 13th level, a druid gains the ability
to change her appearance at will, as if using the *[alter self]*
spell, but only while in her normal form.

**Timeless Body**: After attaining 15th level, a druid no
longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be
magically aged.  Any penalties she may have already incurred,
however, remain in place.  Bonuses still accrue, and the druid
still dies of old age when her time is up.

### Ex-Druids

A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited
[alignment], or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses
all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion,
but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies).  She
cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see
the *[atonement]* spell description).

### Animal Companions 

An animal companion's abilities are determined by the druid's
level and its animal racial traits.  Table: Animal Companion Base
Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the animal
companion.  They remain creatures of the animal type for purposes
of determining which spells can affect them.

  : Table: Animal Companion Base Statistics

**Class Level**: This is the character's druid level.  The druid's
class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are
entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining
the companion's statistics.

**HD**: This is the total number of eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice the
animal companion possesses, each of which gains a [Constitution]
modifier, as normal.

**BAB**: This is the animal companion's base attack bonus.  An
animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a
druid of a level equal to the animal's HD.  Animal companions do
not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a
high base attack bonus.

**Fort/[Ref]/Will**: These are the animal companion's base
[saving throw] bonuses.  An animal companion has good [Fortitude]
and [Reflex saves].

**Skills**: This lists the animal's total skill ranks.  Animal
companions can assign skill ranks to any skill listed under
Animal Skills.  If an animal companion increases its
[Intelligence] to 10 or higher, it gains bonus skill ranks as
normal.  Animal companions with an [Intelligence] of 3 or higher
can purchase ranks in any skill.  An animal companion cannot have
more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.

**Feats**: This is the total number of feats possessed by an
animal companion.  Animal companions should select their feats
from those listed under Animal Feats.  Animal companions can
select other feats, although they are unable to utilize some
feats .  Note that animal companions cannot select a feat with a
requirement of base attack bonus +1 until they gain their second
feat at 3 Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Bonus**: The number noted here is an improvement
to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.

**Str/Dex Bonus**: Add this modifier to the animal companion's
[Strength] and [Dexterity] scores.

**Bonus Tricks**: The value given in this column is the total
number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows in addition to any
that the druid might choose to teach it (see the [Handle Animal]
skill for more details on how to teach an animal tricks).  These
bonus tricks don't require any training time or [Handle Animal]
checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks
known by the animal.  The druid selects these bonus tricks, and
once selected, they can't be changed.

**Special**: This includes a number of abilities gained by animal
companions as they increase in power.  Each of these bonuses is
described below.

*Link [:* A druid can handle her animal companion as a free
action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any
ranks in the [Handle Animal] skill.  The druid gains a +4
circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and [Handle Animal]
checks made regarding an animal companion.

*Share Spells [:* The druid may cast a spell with a target of
“You” on her animal companion instead of on herself.  A druid may
cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally
do not affect creatures of the companion's type .  Spells cast in
this way must come from a class that grants an animal
companion.  This ability does not allow the animal to share
abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.

*Evasion [:* If an animal companion is subjected to an attack
that normally allows a [Reflex] save for half damage, it takes no
damage if it makes a successful [saving throw].

*Ability Score Increase [:* The animal companion adds +1 to one
of its ability scores.

*Devotion [:* An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on
[Will saves] against enchantment spells and effects.

*Multiattack:*An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus
feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already
have that feat.  If it does not have the requisite three or more
natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second
attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty.

*Improved Evasion [:* When subjected to an attack that allows a
[Reflex] [saving throw] for half damage, an animal companion
takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving throw] and only
half damage if the [saving throw] fails.

### Animal Skills 

Animal companions can have ranks in any of the following skills:
[Acrobatics]\* ([Dex]), [Climb]\* ([Str]), [Escape Artist]
([Dex]), [Fly]\* ([Dex]), [Intimidate] ([Cha]), [Perception]\*
([Wis]), [Stealth]\* ([Dex]), [Survival] ([Wis]), and [Swim]\*
([Str]).  All of the skills marked with an (\*) are class skills
for animal companions.  Animal companions with an [Intelligence]
of 3 or higher can put ranks into any skill.

### Animal Feats 

Animal companions can select from the following feats:
[Acrobatic], [Agile Maneuvers], [Armor Proficiency] (light,
medium, and heavy), [Athletic], [Blind-Fight], [Combat Reflexes],
[Diehard], [Dodge], [Endurance], [Great Fortitude], [Improved
Bull Rush], [Improved Initiative], Improved Natural Armor,
Improved Natural Attack, [Improved Overrun], [Intimidating
Prowess], [Iron Will], [Lightning Reflexes], [Mobility], [Power
Attack], [Run], [Skill Focus], [Spring Attack], [Stealthy],
[Toughness], [Weapon Finesse], and [Weapon Focus].  Animal
companions with an [Intelligence] of 3 or higher can select any
feat they are physically capable of using.  GMs might expand this
list to include feats from other sources.

### Druid Animal Choices 

Each animal companion has different starting sizes, speed,
attacks, ability scores, and special qualities.  All animal
attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus
unless otherwise noted.  Animal attacks add the animal's
[Strength] modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only
attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 its [Strength] modifier.
Some have special abilities, such as [scent].  See [Special
Abilities] for more information on these abilities.  As you gain
levels, your animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or
7th level, in addition to the standard bonuses noted on Table:
Animal Companion Base Statistics.  Instead of taking the listed
benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase
the companion's [Dexterity] and [Constitution] by 2.

## Fighter

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge.  Others do battle
to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know
nothing else.  Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone
their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of
war.  Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot,
training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of
armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and
studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living
weapons.  Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal
the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into
arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and
rousing the hearts of armies.  Soldiers, knights, hunters, and
artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to
those who dare stand against them.

**Role**: Fighters excel at combat—defeating their enemies,
controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties
themselves.  While their specific weapons and methods grant them a
wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle
prowess.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Fighter Class Skills

The fighter's class skills are [Climb] ([Str]), [Craft] ([Int]),
[Handle Animal] ([Cha]), [Intimidate] ([Cha]), [Knowledge]
(dungeoneering) ([Int]), [Knowledge] (engineering) ([Int]),
[Profession] ([Wis]), [Ride] ([Dex]), [Survival] ([Wis]), and
[Swim] ([Str]).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + [Int] modifier.

  : Table: Fighter

### Fighter Class Features

The following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with
all [simple] and [martial] weapons and with all armor and shields
.

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, and at every even level
thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those
gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a
feat at every level).  These bonus feats must be selected from
those listed as [combat feats], sometimes also called “fighter
bonus feats.”

Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th,
12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat
in place of a bonus feat he has already learned.  In effect, the
fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one.  The old
feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another
feat, prestige class, or other ability.  A fighter can only change
one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to
swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the
level.

**Bravery**: Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus
on [Will saves] against fear.  This bonus increases by +1 for
every four levels beyond 2nd.

**Armor Training**: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to
be more maneuverable while wearing armor.  Whenever he is wearing
armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 and increases the
maximum [Dexterity] bonus allowed by his armor by 1.  Every four
levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase
by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check
penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum [Dexterity] bonus
allowed.

In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while
wearing medium armor.  At 7th level, a fighter can move at his
normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

**Weapon Training**: Starting at 5th level, a fighter can
select one group of weapons, as noted below.  Whenever he attacks
with a weapon from this group, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls.

Every four levels thereafter , a fighter becomes further trained
in another group of weapons.  He gains a +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls when using a weapon from this group.  In addition,
the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups increase by +1
each.  For example, when a fighter reaches 9th level, he receives
a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one weapon group and a
+2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the weapon group
selected at 5th level.  Bonuses granted from overlapping groups do
not stack.  Take the highest bonus granted for a weapon if it
resides in two or more groups.

A fighter also adds this bonus to any [combat maneuver checks]
made with weapons from this group.  This bonus also applies to the
fighter's [Combat Maneuver Defense] when defending against

whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

**Weapon Mastery**: At 20th level, a fighter chooses one
weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow.  Any attacks
made with that weapon automatically confirm all critical threats
and have their damage multiplier increased by 1 .  In addition, he
cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this type.


## Monk

For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the
battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind.  These
warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and
shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of
crippling or killing as any blade.  These monks (so called since
they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial
disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from
battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers.  Monks tread the
path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path
discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are
meant to be.

**Role**: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting
perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking advantage
of enemy vulnerabilities.  Fleet of foot and skilled in combat,
monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies
wherever they are needed most.

**Alignment**: Any lawful.

**Hit Die**: d8.

  : Table: Monk

### Monk Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monk.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Monks are proficient with the
club, crossbow , dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku,
quarterstaff, sai, shortspear, short sword, shuriken, siangham,
sling, and spear.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.

When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy
load, a monk loses his [AC] bonus, as well as his fast movement
and flurry of blows abilities.

**AC Bonus**: When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds
his [Wisdom] bonus (if any) to his [AC] and his [CMD].  In
addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to [AC] and [CMD] at 4th
level.  This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels
thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

These bonuses to [AC] apply even against touch attacks or when
the monk is [flat-footed].  He loses these bonuses when he is
immobilized or [helpless], when he wears any armor, when he
carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.

**Flurry of Blows**: Starting at 1st level, a monk can make a
flurry of blows as a full-attack action.  When doing so he may
make one additional attack using any combination of unarmed
strikes or attacks with a special monk weapon (kama, nunchaku,
quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham) as if using the
[Two-Weapon Fighting] feat (even if the monk does not meet the
prerequisites for the feat).  For the purpose of these attacks,
the monk's base attack bonus from his monk class levels is equal
to his monk level.  For all other purposes, such as qualifying for
a feat or a prestige class, the monk uses his normal base attack
bonus.

At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he
uses flurry of blows, as if using [Improved Two-Weapon Fighting]
(even if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using
flurry of blows, as if using [Greater Two-Weapon Fighting] (even
if the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

A monk applies his full [Strength] bonus to his damage rolls for
all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether the
attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in
both hands.  A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat
maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows.  A
monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a
special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.  A monk with
natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry of
blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his flurry
of blows attacks.

**Unarmed Strike**: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed
Strike as a bonus feat.  A monk's attacks may be with fist,
elbows, knees, and feet.  This means that a monk may make unarmed
strikes with his hands full.  There is no such thing as an
off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed.  A monk may thus
apply his full [Strength] bonus on damage rolls for all his
unarmed strikes.

Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can
choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his
attack roll.  He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal
damage while grappling.

A monk's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon
and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that
enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural
weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a
normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk.  The unarmed
damage values listed on Table: Monk is for Medium monks.  A Small
monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his
unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Small
or Large Monk Unarmed Damage on the table given below.

  Level       Damage    Damage 
  ----------- --------------------- ---------------------
  1st–3rd     1d4                   1d8
  4th–7th     1d6                   2d6
  8th–11th    1d8                   2d8
  12th–15th   1d10                  3d6
  16th–19th   2d6                   3d8
  20th        2d8                   4d8

  : Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage

**Bonus Feat:** At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels
thereafter, a monk may select a bonus feat.  These feats must be
taken from the following list: [Catch Off-Guard], [Combat
Reflexes], [Deflect Arrows], [Dodge], [Improved Grapple],
[Scorpion Style], and [Throw Anything].  At 6th level, the
following feats are added to the list: [Gorgon's Fist], [Improved
Bull Rush], [Improved Disarm], [Improved Feint], [Improved Trip],
and [Mobility].  At 10th level, the following feats are added to
the list: [Improved Critical], [Medusa's Wrath], [Snatch Arrows],
and [Spring Attack].  A monk need not have any of the
prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

**Stunning Fist**: At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist
as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.  At
4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the
ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning
Fist.  This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round,
and a successful [saving throw] still negates the effect.  At 4th
level, he can choose to make the target [fatigued].  At 8th level,
he can make the target [sickened] for 1 minute.  At 12th level,
he can make the target [staggered] for 1d6+1 rounds.  At 16th
level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target.  At 20th
level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds.  The monk must
choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is
made.  These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature
[sickened] by Stunning Fist cannot become [nauseated] if hit by
Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the
duration.

**Evasion**: At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage
from many area-effect attacks.  If a monk makes a successful
[Reflex] [saving throw] against an attack that normally deals
half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no
damage.  Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor
or no armor.  A [helpless] monk does not gain the benefit of
evasion.

**Fast Movement**: At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement
bonus to his land speed, as shown on Table: Monk.  A monk in armor
or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

**Maneuver Training**: At 3rd level, a monk uses his monk level
in place of his base attack bonus when calculating his [Combat
Maneuver Bonus].  Base attack bonuses granted from other classes
are unaffected and are added normally.

**Still Mind**: A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus
on [saving throws] against enchantment spells and effects.

***Ki* Pool**: At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of *ki*points,
supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats.  The
number of points in a monk's *ki* pool is equal to 1/2 his monk
level + his [Wisdom] modifier.  As long as he has at least 1 point
in his *ki* pool, he can make a *ki* strike.  At 4th level, *ki*
strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction].  *Ki* strike
improves with the character's monk level.  At 10th level, his
unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the
purpose of overcoming [damage reduction].  At 16th level, his
unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose
of overcoming [damage reduction] and bypassing hardness.

By spending 1 point from his *ki* pool, a monk can make one
additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a
flurry of blows attack.  In addition, he can spend 1 point to
increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round.  Finally, a monk can
spend 1 point from his *ki* pool to give himself a +4 [dodge
bonus] to [AC] for 1 round.  Each of these powers is activated as
a swift action.  A monk gains additional powers that consume
points from his *ki* pool as he gains levels.

The *ki* pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest
or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.

**Slow Fall**: At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's
reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent.  When first
gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet
shorter than it actually is.  The monk's ability to slow his fall
(that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next
to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he
can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance
without harm.

**High Jump**: At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all
[Acrobatics] checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and
horizontal jumps.  In addition, he always counts as having a
running start when making jump checks using [Acrobatics].  By
spending 1 point from his *ki* pool as a swift action, a monk
gains a +20 bonus on [Acrobatics] checks made to jump for 1
round.

**Purity of Body**: At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all
diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

**Wholeness of Body**: At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal
his own wounds as a standard action.  He can heal a number of hit
points of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from
his *ki* pool.

**Improved Evasion**: At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability
improves.  He still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex]
[saving throw] against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half
damage on a failed save.  A [helpless] monk does not gain the
benefit of improved evasion.

**Diamond Body**: At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to
poisons of all kinds.

**Abundant Step**: At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip
magically between spaces, as if using the spell *[dimension
door]*.  Using this ability is a move action that consumes 2
points from his *ki* pool.  His caster level for this effect is
equal to his monk level.  He cannot take other creatures with him
when he uses this ability.

**Diamond Soul**: At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance
equal to his current monk level + 10.  In order to affect the monk
with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's
spell resistance.

**Quivering Palm**: Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up
vibrations within the body of another creature that can
thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires.  He can use this
quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his
intent before making his attack roll.  Creatures immune to
critical hits cannot be affected.  Otherwise, if the monk strikes
successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the
quivering palm attack succeeds.  Thereafter, the monk can try to
slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made
within a number of days equal to his monk level.  To make such an
attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die , and unless the
target makes a [Fortitude] [saving throw] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's
level + the monk's [Wis] modifier), it dies.  If the [saving
throw] is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that
particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by
another one at a later time.  A monk can have no more than 1
quivering palm in effect at one time.  If a monk uses quivering
palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is
negated.

**Timeless Body**: At 17th level, a monk no longer takes
penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically
aged.  Any such penalties that he has already taken, however,
remain in place.  Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still
dies of old age when his time is up.

**Tongue of the Sun and Moon**: A monk of 17th level or higher
can speak with any living creature.

**Empty Body**: At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to
assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell
*[etherealness].* Using this ability is a move action that
consumes 3 points from his *ki* pool.  This ability only affects
the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.

**Perfect Self**: At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical
creature.  He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as
a humanoid for the purpose of spells and magical
effects.  Additionally, the monk gains [damage reduction]
10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of
damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any
natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar
[damage reduction].  Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be
brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous
creature type.

### Ex-Monks

A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but
retains all monk abilities.


## Paladin

Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine.
Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and
lives to the battle against evil.  Knights, crusaders, and
law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but
to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve.  In
pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of
morality and discipline.  As reward for their righteousness, these
holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their
quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the
faithful.  Although their convictions might lead them into
conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather
endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their
lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

**Role**: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the
chaos of battle.  While deadly opponents of evil, they can also
empower goodly souls to aid in their crusades.  Their magic and
martial skills also make them well suited to defending others and
blessing the fallen with the strength to continue fighting.

**Alignment**: Lawful good.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Paladin Class Features

All of the following are class features of the paladin.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Paladins are proficient with
all [simple] and [martial] weapons, with all types of armor , and
with shields .

**Aura of Good**: The power of a paladin's aura of good (see
the *[detect good]* spell) is equal to her paladin level.

**Detect Evil****: At will, a paladin can use *[detect evil],*
**as the spell.  A paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a
**single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is
**evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it
**for 3 rounds.  While focusing on one individual or object, the
**paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual
**within range.

**Smite Evil**: Once per day, a paladin can call out to the
powers of good to aid her in her struggle against evil.  As a
swift action, the paladin chooses one target within sight to
smite.  If this target is evil, the paladin adds her [Charisma]
bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to
all damage rolls made against the target of her smite.  If the
target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an
evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage
on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage
per level the paladin possesses.  Regardless of the target, smite
evil attacks automatically bypass any [DR] the creature might
possess.

In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a
deflection bonus equal to her [Charisma] modifier (if any) to her
[AC] against attacks made by the target of the smite.  If the
paladin targets a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted
with no effect.

The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is
dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of
this ability.  At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter,
the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as
indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day
at 19th level.

**Divine Grace**: At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal
to her [Charisma] bonus (if any) on all [saving throws].

**Lay On Hands**: Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin can heal
wounds (her own or those of others) by touch.  Each day she can
use this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 her paladin level
plus her [Charisma] modifier.  With one use of this ability, a
paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin
levels she possesses.  Using this ability is a standard action,
unless the paladin targets herself, in which case it is a swift
action.  Despite the name of this ability, a paladin only needs
one free hand to use this ability.

Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal
damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for
every two levels the paladin possesses.  Using lay on hands in
this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't
provoke an [attack of opportunity].  Undead do not receive a
[saving throw] against this damage.

**Aura of Courage**: At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear
.  Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on
[saving throws] against fear effects.  This ability functions only
while the paladin is conscious, not if she is [unconscious] or
dead.

**Divine Health**: At 3rd level, a paladin is immune to all
diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases, including
mummy rot.

**Mercy**: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a
paladin can select one mercy.  Each mercy adds an effect to the
paladin's lay on hands ability.  Whenever the paladin uses lay on
hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the
additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the
paladin.  A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse,
disease, or poison without curing the affliction.  Such conditions
return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the
affliction that causes the condition.

At 3rd level, the paladin can select from the following initial
mercies.

*• Fatigued*: The target is no longer [fatigued].

*• Shaken*: The target is no longer [shaken].

*• Sickened*: The target is no longer [sickened].

At 6th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Dazed*: The target is no longer [dazed].

*• Diseased*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*remove disease*, using the paladin's level as the caster level.

*• Staggered*: The target is no longer [staggered], unless the
target is at exactly 0 hit points.

At 9th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Cursed*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*[remove curse],* using the paladin's level as the caster level.

*• Exhausted*: The target is no longer [exhausted].  The paladin
must have the fatigue mercy before selecting this mercy.

*• Frightened*: The target is no longer [frightened].  The paladin
must have the [shaken] mercy before selecting this mercy.

*• Nauseated*: The target is no longer [nauseated].  The paladin
must have the [sickened] mercy before selecting this mercy.

*• Poisoned*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*neutralize poison*, using the paladin's level as the caster
*level.

At 12th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list
of those that can be selected.

*• Blinded*: The target is no longer [blinded].

*• Deafened*: The target is no longer [deafened].

*• Paralyzed*: The target is no longer [paralyzed].

*• Stunned*: The target is no longer [stunned].

These abilities are cumulative.  For example, a 12th-level
paladin's lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and
might also cure [fatigued] and [exhausted] conditions as well as
removing diseases and neutralizing poisons*.*Once a condition or
spell effect is chosen, it can't be changed.

**Channel Positive Energy**: When a paladin reaches 4th level,
she gains the supernatural ability to channel positive energy
like a cleric.  Using this ability consumes two uses of her lay on
hands ability.  A paladin uses her level as her effective cleric
level when channeling positive energy.  This is a [Charisma]-based
ability.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability
to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the
paladin spell list presented in [Spell Lists].  A paladin must
choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a [Charisma]
score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty
Class for a [saving throw] against a paladin's spell is 10 + the
spell level + the paladin's [Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Paladin.  In addition, she receives
bonus spells per day if she has a high [Charisma] score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).  When Table:
Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a
given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be
entitled to based on her [Charisma] score for that spell level.

A paladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and
meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells.  A paladin may
prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided
that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which
spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level.  At 4th level
and higher, her caster level is equal to her paladin level – 3.

**Divine Bond**: Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a
divine bond with her god.  This bond can take one of two
forms.  Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.

The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon
as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial
spirit for 1 minute per paladin level.  When called, the spirit
causes the weapon to shed light as a torch.  At 5th level, this
spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus.  For every three
levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus,
to a maximum of +6 at 20th level.  These bonuses can be added to
the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of
+5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon
properties: *[axiomatic]*, *[brilliant energy], [defending],
[disruption], [flaming], [flaming burst], [holy], [keen],
[merciful]*, and *[speed]*.  Adding these properties consumes an
amount of bonus equal to the property's cost .  These bonuses are
added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate
abilities do not stack.  If the weapon is not magical, at least a
+1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties
can be added.  The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are
determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until
the spirit is called again.  The celestial spirit imparts no
bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the paladin
but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin.  These
bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon.  A paladin can
use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional
time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four
times per day at 17th level.

If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the
paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she
gains a level, whichever comes first.  During this 30-day period,
the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of
an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in
her crusade against evil.  This mount is usually a heavy horse or
a pony , although more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or
dog are also suitable.  This mount functions as a druid's animal
companion, using the paladin's level as her effective druid
level.  Bonded mounts have an [Intelligence] of at least 6.

Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically
call her mount to her side.  This ability is the equivalent of a
spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level.  The
mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin.  A paladin can
use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional
time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four
times per day at 17th level.

At 11th level, the mount gains the celestial template and becomes
a magical beast for the purposes of determining which spells
affect it.  At 15th level, a paladin's mount gains spell
resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.

Should the paladin's mount die, the paladin may not summon
another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level,
whichever comes first.  During this 30-day period, the paladin
takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

**Aura of Resolve**: At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm
spells and spell-like abilities.  Each ally within 10 feet of her
gains a +4 morale bonus on [saving throws] against charm effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious] or dead.

**Aura of Justice**: At 11th level, a paladin can expend two
uses of her smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil
to all allies within 10 feet, using her bonuses.  Allies must use
this smite evil ability by the start of the paladin's next turn
and the bonuses last for 1 minute.  Using this ability is a free
action.  Evil creatures gain no benefit from this ability.

**Aura of Faith**: At 14th level, a paladin's weapons are
treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming [damage
reduction].  Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of
her is treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming
[damage reduction].

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious] or dead.

**Aura of Righteousness**: At 17th level, a paladin gains [DR]
5/evil and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like
abilities.  Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale
bonus on [saving throws] against compulsion effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious] or dead.

**Holy Champion**: At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit
for the power of her god.  Her [DR] increases to 10/evil.
Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil
outsider, the outsider is also subject to a *[banishment],* using
her paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol
automatically count as objects that the subject hates).  After the
*[banishment]* effect and the damage from the attack is resolved,
the smite immediately ends.  In addition, whenever she channels
positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she
heals the maximum possible amount.

**Code of Conduct**: A paladin must be of lawful good [alignment]
and loses all class features except proficiencies if she ever
willingly commits an evil act.

Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect
legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating,
not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided
they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish
those who harm or threaten innocents.

**Associates**: While she may adventure with good or neutral
allies, a paladin avoids working with evil characters or with
anyone who consistently offends her moral code.  Under exceptional
circumstances, a paladin can ally with evil associates, but only
to defeat what she believes to be a greater evil.  A paladin
should seek an *[atonement]* spell periodically during such an
unusual alliance, and should end the alliance immediately should
she feel it is doing more harm than good.  A paladin may accept
only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.

### Ex-Paladins

A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an
evil act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all paladin
spells and class features (including the service of the paladin's
mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies).  She may
not progress any further in levels as a paladin.  She regains her
abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her
violations (see the *[atonement]* spell description in [Spell
Lists]), as appropriate.


## Ranger

For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only
predators and prey.  Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters,
rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized
weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the
expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries.  Knowledgeable,
patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and
monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator,
skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial
prowess.  While some track man-eating creatures to protect the
frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among
their own people.

**Role**: Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at
range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle.  Their
abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types
of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of
enemies.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Ranger Class Skills

The ranger's class skills are [Climb] ([Str]), [Craft] ([Int]),
[Handle Animal] ([Cha]), Heal ([Wis]), [Intimidate] ([Cha]),
[Knowledge] (dungeoneering) ([Int]), [Knowledge] (geography)
([Int]), [Knowledge] (nature) ([Int]), [Perception] ([Wis]),
[Profession] ([Wis]), [Ride] ([Dex]), [Spellcraft] ([Int]),
[Stealth] ([Dex]), [Survival] ([Wis]), and [Swim] ([Str]).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + [Int] modifier.

  : Ranger Favored Enemies

**Favored Enemy**: At 1st level, a ranger selects a creature
type from the ranger favored enemies table.  He gains a +2 bonus
on [Bluff], [Knowledge], [Perception], [Sense Motive], and
[Survival] checks against creatures of his selected
type.  Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage
rolls against them.  A ranger may make [Knowledge] [skill checks]
untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and
20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy.
In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one
favored enemy increases by +2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy,
he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the
table below.  (Note that there are other types of humanoid to
choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are
merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more
than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not
stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

**Track**: A ranger adds half his level to [Survival] [skill
checks] made to follow or identify tracks.

**Wild Empathy**: A ranger can improve the initial attitude of
an animal.  This ability functions just like a [Diplomacy] check
to improve the attitude of a person (see [Using Skills]).  The
ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his [Charisma]
bonus to determine the wild empathy check result.  The typical
domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while
wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30
feet of one another under normal visibility conditions.
Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but,
as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast
with an [Intelligence] score of 1 or 2, but he takes a –4 penalty
on the check.

**Combat Style Feat**: At 2nd level, a ranger must select one
of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat.  The
ranger's expertise manifests in the form of bonus feats at 2nd,
6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.  He can choose feats from his
selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal
prerequisites.

If the ranger selects archery, he can choose from the following
list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Far Shot], [Point
Blank Shot], [Precise Shot], and [Rapid Shot].  At 6th level, he
adds [Improved Precise Shot] and [Manyshot] to the list.  At 10th
level, he adds [Pinpoint Targeting] and [Shot on the Run] to the
list.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he can choose from the
following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Double
Slice], [Improved Shield Bash], [Quick Draw], and [Two-Weapon
Fighting].  At 6th level, he adds [Improved Two-Weapon Fighting]
and [Two-Weapon Defense] to the list.  At 10th level, he adds
[Greater Two-Weapon Fighting] and [Two-Weapon Rend] to the list.

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when
he wears light, medium, or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his
combat style feats when wearing heavy armor.  Once a ranger
selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

**Endurance**: A ranger gains [Endurance] as a bonus feat at 3rd
level.

  : Favored Terrains

**Favored Terrain**: At 3rd level, a ranger may select a type
of terrain from the Favored Terrains table.  The ranger gains a +2
bonus on initiative checks and [Knowledge] (geography), [Perception],
[Stealth], and [Survival] [skill checks] when he is in this
terrain.  A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally
leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a
trail if he so chooses).

At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may
select an additional favored terrain.  In addition, at each such
interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored
terrain , increases by +2.

If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of
favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply
uses whichever bonus is higher.

**Hunter's Bond**: At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his
hunting companions.  This bond can take one of two forms.  Once the
form is chosen, it cannot be changed.  The first is a bond to his
companions.  This bond allows him to spend a move action to grant
half his favored enemy bonus against a single target of the
appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear
him.  This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
ranger's [Wisdom] modifier .  This bonus does not stack with any
favored enemy bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever
bonus is higher.

The second option is to form a close bond with an [animal
companion].  A ranger who selects an animal companion can choose
from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat , dire rat,
dog, horse, pony, snake , or wolf.  If the campaign takes place
wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose
a shark instead.  This animal is a loyal companion that
accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its
kind.  A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and
favored terrain bonuses.

This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability ,
except that the ranger's effective druid level is equal to his
ranger level – 3.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to
cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the
ranger spell list presented in [Spell Lists].  A ranger must
choose and prepare his spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a [Wisdom] score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty Class for
a [saving throw] against a ranger's spell is 10 + the spell level
+ the ranger's [Wisdom] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day.  His base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Ranger.  In addition, he receives
bonus spells per day if he has a high [Wisdom] score (see [Table:
Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).  When Table: Ranger
indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell
level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to
based on his [Wisdom] score for that spell level.

A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain
his daily allotment of spells.  A ranger may prepare and cast any
spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells
of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during
his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level.  At 4th level and
higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level – 3.

**Woodland Stride**: Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move
through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars,
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and
without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or
magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect
him.

**Swift Tracker**: Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at
his normal speed while using [Survival] to follow tracks without
taking the normal –5 penalty.  He takes only a –10 penalty when
moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

**Evasion**: When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even
magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If he makes a
successful [Reflex] [saving throw] against an attack that
normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes
no damage.  Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing
light armor, medium armor, or no armor.  A [helpless] ranger does
not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Quarry**: At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action,
denote one target within his line of sight as his
quarry.  Whenever he is following the tracks of his quarry, a
ranger can take 10 on his [Survival] [skill checks] while moving
at normal speed, without penalty.  In addition, he receives a +2
insight bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all
critical threats are automatically confirmed.  A ranger can have
no more than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must
correspond to one of his favored enemy types.  He can dismiss this
effect at any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new
quarry for 24 hours.  If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is
dead, he can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.

**Camouflage**: A ranger of 12th level or higher can use the
[Stealth] skill to hide in any of his favored terrains, even if
the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.

**Improved Evasion**: At 16th level, a ranger's evasion
improves.  This ability works like evasion, except that while the
ranger still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex] [saving
throw] against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a
failed save.  A [helpless] ranger does not gain the benefit of
improved evasion.

**Hide in Plain Sight**: While in any of his favored terrains,
a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the [Stealth] skill even
while being observed.

**Improved Quarry**: At 19th level, the ranger's ability to
hunt his quarry improves.  He can now select a quarry as a free
action, and can now take 20 while using [Survival] to track his
quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty.  His insight
bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4.  If his quarry is
killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes
have passed.

**Master Hunter**: A ranger of 20th level becomes a master
hunter.  He can always move at full speed while using [Survival]
to follow tracks without penalty.  He can, as a standard action,
make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack
bonus.  If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and
must make a [Fortitude] save or die.  The DC of this save is
equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the ranger's [Wisdom]
modifier.  A ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of
nonlethal damage equal to the creature's current hit points.  A
successful save negates this damage.  A ranger can use this
ability once per day against each favored enemy type he
possesses, but not against the same creature more than once in a
24-hour period.


## Rogue

Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits.
Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning,
skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor.  Never knowing what
to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a
wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept
manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any
of dozens of other professions or talents.  Thieves and gamblers,
fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and
explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as
well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess,
or luck.  Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable
opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road,
journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic
danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches.  In the end, any
who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms
might come to be called rogues.

**Role**: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes
unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat.  Their varied
skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with
great variations in expertise existing between different rogues.
Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from
unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards
and conning dull-witted opponents.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

  : Table: Rogue

### Rogue Class Features

The following are class features of the rogue.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Rogues are proficient with all
[simple] weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow,
and short sword.  They are proficient with light armor, but not
with shields.

**Sneak Attack**: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is
unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can
strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The rogue's attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be
denied a [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] (whether the target actually
has a [Dexterity] bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her
target.  This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by
1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.  Should the rogue score a
[critical hit] with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not
multiplied.  Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the
target is within 30 feet.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or
an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals
nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage.  She cannot use a
weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a
sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.

The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out
a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.  A rogue
cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.

**Trapfinding**: A rogue adds 1/2 her level to [Perception]
[skill checks] made to locate traps and to [Disable Device]
[skill checks] .  A rogue can use [Disable Device] to disarm magic
traps.

**Evasion**: At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even
magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If she makes a
successful [Reflex] [saving throw] against an attack that
normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead
takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing
light armor or no armor.  A [helpless] rogue does not gain the
benefit of evasion.

**Rogue Talents**: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a
number of talents that aid her and confound her foes.  Starting at
2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent.  She gains an
additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained
after 2nd level.  A rogue cannot select an individual talent more
than once.

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue's sneak
attack.  Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual
attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is
made.

*Bleeding Attack\**: A rogue with this ability can cause living
opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack.  This
attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage
each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6
equals 4 points of [bleed]).  Bleeding creatures take that amount
of damage every round at the start of each of their turns.  The
bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [Heal] check or the
application of any effect that heals hit point damage.  Bleeding
damage from this ability does not stack with itself.  Bleeding
damage bypasses any [damage reduction] the creature might
possess.

*Combat Trick*: A rogue that selects this talent gains a bonus
[combat feat] (see [Feats]).

*Fast Stealth*: This ability allows a rogue to move at full
speed using the [Stealth] skill without penalty.

*Finesse Rogue*: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon
Finesse] as a bonus feat.

*Ledge Walker*: This ability allows a rogue to move along
narrow surfaces at full speed using the [Acrobatics] skill
without penalty.  In addition, a rogue with this talent is not
[flat-footed] when using [Acrobatics] to move along narrow
surfaces.

*Major Magic**: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to
*cast a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list two
*times a day as a [spell-like ability].  The caster level for this
*ability is equal to the rogue's level.  The save DC for this
*spell is 11 + the rogue's [Intelligence] modifier.  The rogue
*must have an [Intelligence] of at least 11 to select this
*talent.  A rogue must have the minor magic rogue talent before
*choosing this talent.

*Minor Magic**: A rogue with this talent gains the ability to
*cast a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.  This
*spell can be cast three times a day as a [spell-like
*ability].  The caster level for this ability is equal to the
*rogue's level.  The save DC for this spell is 10 + the rogue's
*[Intelligence] modifier.  The rogue must have an [Intelligence]
*of at least 10 to select this talent.

*Quick Disable*: It takes a rogue with this ability half the
normal amount of time to disable a trap using the [Disable
Device] skill .

*Resiliency*: Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain
a number of [temporary hit points] equal to the rogue's
level.  Activating this ability is an immediate action that can
only be performed when she is brought to below 0 hit points.  This
ability can be used to prevent her from [dying].  These [temporary
hit points] last for 1 minute.  If the rogue's hit points drop
below 0 due to the loss of these [temporary hit points], she
falls [unconscious] and is [dying] as normal.

*Rogue Crawl*: While [prone], a rogue with this ability can
move at half speed.  This movement provokes attacks of opportunity
as normal.  A rogue with this talent can take a 5-foot step while
crawling.

*Slow Reactions\**: Opponents damaged by the rogue's sneak
attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.

*Stand Up*: A rogue with this ability can stand up from a
[prone] position as a free action.  This still provokes attacks of
opportunity for standing up while threatened by a foe.

*Surprise Attack*: During the surprise round, opponents are
always considered [flat-footed] to a rogue with this ability,
even if they have already acted.

*Trap Spotter*: Whenever a rogue with this talent comes within
10 feet of a trap, she receives an immediate [Perception] skill
check to notice the trap.  This check should be made in secret by
the GM.

*Weapon Training*: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon
Focus] as a bonus feat.

**Trap Sense**: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense
that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on
[Reflex saves] made to avoid traps and a +1 [dodge bonus] to [AC]
against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses rise to +2 when the
rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4
when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th
level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Uncanny Dodge**: Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to
danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.  She
cannot be caught [flat-footed], nor does she lose her Dex bonus
to AC if the attacker is [invisible].  She still loses her
[Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if immobilized.  A rogue with this
ability can still lose her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC] if an
opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge**: A rogue of 8th level or higher can
no longer be flanked.

This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the
character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four
more rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another
class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
character.

**Advanced Talents**: At 10th level, and every two levels
thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced
talents in place of a rogue talent.

*Crippling Strike\***: A rogue with this ability can sneak
*attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and
*hamper them.  An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks
*also takes 2 points of [Strength] damage.

*Defensive Roll**: With this advanced talent, the rogue can
*roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it
*than she otherwise would.  Once per day, when she would be
*reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a
*weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue
*can attempt to roll with the damage.  To use this ability, the
*rogue must attempt a [Reflex] [saving throw] .  If the save
*succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails,
*she takes full damage.  She must be aware of the attack and able
*to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she is
*denied her [Dexterity] bonus to [AC], she can't use this
*ability.  Since this effect would not normally allow a character
*to make a [Reflex] save for half damage, the rogue's evasion
*ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

*Dispelling Attack\**: Opponents that are dealt sneak attack
damage by a rogue with this ability are affected by a targeted
*[dispel magic]*, targeting the lowest-level spell effect active
on the target.  The caster level for this ability is equal to the
rogue's level.  A rogue must have the major magic rogue talent
before choosing dispelling attack.

*Improved Evasion**: This works like evasion, except that while
*the rogue still takes no damage on a successful [Reflex] saving
*throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on
*a failed save.  A [helpless] rogue does not gain the benefit of
*improved evasion.

*Opportunist**: Once per round, the rogue can make an [attack
*of opportunity] against an opponent who has just been struck for
*damage in melee by another character.  This attack counts as an
*[attack of opportunity] for that round.  Even a rogue with the
*Combat Reflexes feat can't use the opportunist ability more than
*once per round.

*Skill Mastery*: The rogue becomes so confident in the use of
certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse
conditions.

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal
to 3 + her [Intelligence] modifier.  When making a skill check
with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and
distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.  A rogue
may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting
additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.

*Slippery Mind**: This ability represents the rogue's ability
*to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise
*control or compel her.  If a rogue with slippery mind is affected
*by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her [saving throw],
*she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC.  She gets
*only this one extra chance to succeed on her [saving throw].

*Feat*: A rogue may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place
of a rogue talent.

**Master Strike***[*: Upon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes
incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage.  Each time the
rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the
following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4
hours, [paralyzed] for 2d6 rounds, or slain.  Regardless of the
effect chosen, the target receives a [Fortitude] save to negate
the additional effect.  The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2
the rogue's level + the rogue's [Intelligence] modifier.  Once a
creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of
whether or not the save is made, that creature is immune to that
rogue's master strike for 24 hours.  Creatures that are immune to
sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.

## Sorcerer

Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the
spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of
fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess
and draw forth might few mortals can imagine.  Emboldened by lives
ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these
magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their
mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their
birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats.  Just as
varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and
inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their
gifts.  While some seek to control their abilities through
meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic
birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their
lives with often explosive results.  Regardless, sorcerers live
and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to
mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of
study; it is life itself.

**Role**: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored
spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages.  As they
become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells,
sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of
magics other spellcasters might overlook.  Their bloodlines also
grant them additional abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers
are ever quite alike.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.

### Sorcerer Class Skills

The sorcerer's class skills are [Appraise] ([Int]), [Bluff]
([Cha]), [Craft] ([Int]), [Fly] ([Dex]), [Intimidate] ([Cha]),
[Knowledge] (arcana) ([Int]), [Profession] ([Wis]), [Spellcraft]

### Sorcerer Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Sorcerers are proficient with
all [simple] weapons.  They are not proficient with any type of
armor or shield.  Armor interferes with a sorcerer's gestures,
which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see
[Arcane Spells and Armor]).

**Spells**: A sorcerer casts arcane spells drawn primarily from
the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in [Spell Lists].  She
can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of
time.  To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a [Charisma]
score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The Difficulty
Class for a [saving throw] against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the
spell level + the sorcerer's [Charisma] modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain
number of spells of each spell level per day.  Her base daily
spell allotment is given on Table: Sorcerer.  In addition, she
receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Charisma] score
(see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells]).

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited.  A sorcerer
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells
of her choice.  At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more
new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.  (Unlike
spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not
affected by her [Charisma] score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer
Spells Known are fixed.)  These new spells can be common spells
chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be
unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of
through study.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer
level after that , a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in
place of one she already knows.  In effect, the sorcerer loses the
old spell in exchange for the new one.  The new spell's level must
be the same as that of the spell being exchanged.  A sorcerer may
swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose
whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains
new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her
spells in advance.  She can cast any spell she knows at any time,
assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that
spell level.

**Bloodline**: Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in
her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional
class skill, and other special abilities.  This source can
represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a
creature somewhere in the family's past.  For example, a sorcerer
might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather
might have signed a terrible contract with a devil.  Regardless of
the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the
sorcerer gains levels.  A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon
taking her first level of sorcerer.  Once made, this choice cannot
be changed.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns
an additional spell, derived from her bloodline.  These spells are
in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Sorcerer
Spells Known.  These spells cannot be exchanged for different
spells at higher levels.

At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer
receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each
bloodline.  The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these
bonus feats.

**Cantrips**: Sorcerers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, as noted on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known under “Spells
Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do
not consume any slots and may be used again.

**Eschew Materials**: A sorcerer gains [Eschew Materials] as a
bonus feat at 1st level.

### Sorcerer Bloodlines 

The following bloodlines represent only some of the possible
sources of power that a sorcerer can draw upon.  Unless otherwise
noted, most sorcerers are assumed to have the arcane bloodline.

#### Aberrant

There is a taint in your blood, one that is alien and bizarre.
You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle
that most would not expect.  Over time, this taint manifests
itself in your physical form.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (dungeoneering).

**Bonus Spells**: *[enlarge person]* (3rd), *[see invisibility]*
, *[tongues]* , *[black tentacles]* , *[feeblemind]* , *[veil]*,
*[plane shift]* , *[mind blank]* , *[shapechange]*.

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting], [Improved Disarm], [Improved
Grapple], [Improved Initiative], [Improved Unarmed Strike], [Iron
Will], [Silent Spell], [Skill Focus] ([Knowledge]
[dungeoneering]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[polymorph] subschool, increase the duration of the spell by 50%
.  This bonus does not stack with the increase granted by the
[Extend Spell] feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Aberrant sorcerers show increasing signs of
their tainted heritage as they increase in level, although they
are only visible when used.

*Acidic Ray*: Starting at 1st level, you can fire an acidic
ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a
ranged touch attack.  The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid
damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess.  You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Charisma] modifier.

*Long Limbs*: At 3rd level, your reach increases by 5 feet
whenever you are making a melee touch attack.  This ability does
not otherwise increase your threatened area.  At 11th level, this
bonus to your reach increases to 10 feet.  At 17th level, this
bonus to your reach increases to 15 feet.

*Unusual Anatomy*: At 9th level, your anatomy changes, giving
you a 25% chance to ignore any [critical hit] or sneak attack
scored against you.  This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.

*Alien Resistance*: At 15th level, you gain spell resistance
equal to your sorcerer level + 10.

*Aberrant Form*: At 20th level, your body becomes truly
unnatural.  You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks.  In
addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and [damage
reduction] 5/—.

#### Abyssal

Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage.
While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is
particularly strong.  You might sometimes have urges to chaos or
evil, but your destiny (and [alignment]) is up to you.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (planes).

**Bonus Spells**: *[cause fear]* (3rd), *[bull's strength]* ,
*[rage]* , *[stoneskin]* , *[dismissal]* , *[transformation]* ,
*[greater teleport]* , *[unholy aura]* , *[summon monster IX]* .

**Bonus Feats**: [Augment Summoning], [Cleave], [Empower Spell],
[Great Fortitude], [Improved Bull Rush], [Improved Sunder],
[Power Attack], [Skill Focus] ([Knowledge] [planes]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[summoning] subschool, the creatures summoned gain [DR]/good
equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level .  This does not stack with any
[DR] the creature might have.

**Bloodline Powers**: While some would say that you are
possessed, you know better.  The demonic influence in your blood
grows as you gain power.

*Claws*: At 1st level, you can grow claws as a free
action.  These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you
to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full
base attack bonus.  These attacks deal 1d4 points of damage each
plus your [Strength] modifier.  At 5th level, these claws are
considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [DR].  At
7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of
damage .  At 11th level, these claws become *flaming* *weapons*,
each dealing an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a
successful hit.  You can use your claws for a number of rounds per
day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.  These rounds do not
need to be consecutive.

*Demon Resistances*: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity
5 and a +2 bonus on [saving throws] made against poison.  At 9th
level, your resistance to electricity increases to 10 and your
bonus on poison [saving throws] increases to +4.

*Strength of the Abyss*: At 9th level, you gain a +2 inherent
bonus to your [Strength].  This bonus increases to +4 at 13th
level, and to +6 at 17th level.

*Added Summonings*: At 15th level, whenever you summon a
creature with the demon subtype or the fiendish template using a
*[summon monster]* spell, you summon one additional creature of
the same kind.

*Demonic Might**: At 20th level, the power of the Abyss flows
*through you.  You gain immunity to electricity and poison.  You
*also gain resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and gain
*telepathy with a range of 60 feet (allowing you to communicate
*with any creature that can speak a language).

#### Arcane

Your family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic.
While many of your relatives were accomplished wizards, your
powers developed without the need for study and practice.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (any one).

**Bonus Spells**: *[identify]* (3rd), *[invisibility]* , *[dispel
magic]* , *[dimension door]*, *[overland flight]*, *[true
seeing]* , *[greater teleport]* , *[power word stun]* , *[wish]*
.

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting], [Improved Counterspell],
[Improved Initiative], [Iron Will], [Scribe Scroll], [Skill
Focus] ([Knowledge] [arcana]), [Spell Focus], [Still Spell].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you apply a [metamagic feat] to a
spell that increases the slot used by at least one level,
increase the spell's DC by +1.  This bonus does not stack with
itself and does not apply to spells modified by the [Heighten
Spell] feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Magic comes naturally to you, but as you
gain levels you must take care to prevent the power from
overwhelming you.

*Arcane Bond**: At 1st level, you gain an [arcane bond], as a
*wizard equal to your sorcerer level.  Your sorcerer levels stack
*with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers
*of your familiar or bonded object.  This ability does not allow
*you to have both a familiar and a bonded item.  Once per day,
*your bond item allows you to cast any one of our spells known
*(unlike a wizard's bonded item, which allows him to cast any one
*spell in his spellbook).

*Metamagic Adept*: At 3rd level, you can apply any one
metamagic feat you know to a spell you are about to cast without
increasing the casting time.  You must still expend a higher-level
spell slot to cast this spell.  You can use this ability once per
day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four
sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day
at 19th level.  At 20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane
apotheosis.

*New Arcana*: At 9th level, you can add any one spell from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list to your list of spells known.  This
spell must be of a level that you are capable of casting.  You can
also add one additional spell at 13th level and 17th level.

*School Power*: At 15th level, pick one school of magic.  The DC
for any spells you cast from that school increases by +2.  This
bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [Spell Focus].

*Arcane Apotheosis*: At 20th level, your body surges with
arcane power.  You can add any [metamagic feats] that you know to
your spells without increasing their casting time, although you
must still expend higher-level spell slots.  Whenever you use
magic items that require charges, you can instead expend spell
slots to power the item.  For every three levels of spell slots
that you expend, you consume one less charge when using a magic
item that expends charges.

#### Celestial

Your bloodline is blessed by a celestial power, either from a
celestial ancestor or through divine intervention.  Although this
power drives you along the path of good, your fate (and
[alignment]) is your own to determine.

**Class Skill**: Heal.

**Bonus Spells**: *[bless]* (3rd), [resist energy]*, [magic
*circle against evil]* , *[remove curse]* ,*[flame strike]* ,
**[greater dispel magic]* , [banishment]* , [sunburst]*
*,*[gate]*.

**Bonus Feats**: [Dodge], [Extend Spell], [Iron Will],
[Mobility], [Mounted Combat], [Ride-By Attack], [Skill Focus]
([Knowledge] [religion]), [Weapon Finesse].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[summoning] subschool, the creatures summoned gain [DR]/evil
equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level .  This does not stack with any
[DR] the creature might have.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your celestial heritage grants you a great
many powers, but they come at a price.  The lords of the higher
planes are watching you and your actions closely.

*Heavenly Fire*: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray
of heavenly fire as a standard action, targeting any foe within
30 feet as a ranged touch attack.  Against evil creatures, this
ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels
you possess.  This damage is divine and not subject to energy
resistance or immunity.  This ray heals good creatures of 1d4
points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess.  A
good creature cannot benefit from your heavenly fire more than
once per day.  Neutral creatures are neither harmed nor healed by
this effect.  You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

*Celestial Resistances*: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5
and resist cold 5.  At 9th level, your resistances increase to 10.

*Wings of Heaven*: At 9th level, you can sprout feathery wings
and fly for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer
level, with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability.  This
duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in
1 minute increments.

*Conviction*: At 15th level, you can reroll any one ability
check, attack roll, skill check, or [saving throw] you just
made.  You must decide to use this ability after the die is
rolled, but before the results are revealed by the GM.  You must
take the second result, even if it is worse.  You can use this
ability once per day.

*Ascension*: At 20th level, you become infused with the power
of the heavens.  You gain immunity to acid, cold, and
petrification.  You also gain resist electricity 10, resist fire
10, and a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison.  Finally, you
gain unlimited use of the wings of heaven ability.  Finally, you
gain the ability to speak with any creature that has a language
(as per the *[tongues]*spell).

#### Destined

Your family is destined for greatness in some way.  Your birth
could have been foretold in prophecy, or perhaps it occurred
during an especially auspicious event, such as a solar eclipse.
Regardless of your bloodline's origin, you have a great future
ahead.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (history).

**Bonus Spells**:*[alarm]* (3rd), [blur]* , *[protection from
*energy]* , *[freedom of movement]* , *[break enchantment]*,
*[mislead]* , *[spell turning]* , [moment of prescience]*,
*[foresight]* .

**Bonus Feats**: [Arcane Strike], [Diehard], [Endurance],
[Leadership], [Lightning Reflexes], [Maximize Spell], [Skill
Focus] ([Knowledge] [history]), [Weapon Focus].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with a range of
“personal,” you gain a luck bonus equal to the spell's level on
all your [saving throws] for 1 round.

**Bloodline Powers**: You are destined for great things, and the
powers that you gain serve to protect you.

*Touch of Destiny**: At 1st level, you can touch a creature as
*a standard action, giving it an insight bonus on attack rolls,
*[skill checks], ability checks, and [saving throws] equal to 1/2
*your sorcerer level for 1 round.  You can use this ability a
*number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

*Fated* *[*: Starting at 3rd level, you gain a +1 luck bonus on
all of your [saving throws] and to your [AC] during surprise
rounds (see [Combat]) and when you are otherwise unaware of an
attack.  At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, this bonus
increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level.

*It Was Meant To Be**: At 9th level, you may reroll any one
*attack roll, [critical hit] confirmation roll, or level check
*made to overcome spell resistance.  You must decide to use this
*ability after the first roll is made but before the results are
*revealed by the GM.  You must take the second result, even if it
*is worse.  At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day.
*At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

*Within Reach**: At 15th level, your ultimate destiny is
*drawing near.  Once per day, when an attack or spell that causes
*damage would result in your death, you may attempt a DC 20 [Will
*save].  If successful, you are instead reduced to –1 hit points
*and are automatically stabilized.  The bonus from your fated
*ability applies to this save.

*Destiny Realized**: At 20th level, your moment of destiny is
*at hand.  Any critical threats made against you only confirm if
*the second roll results in a natural 20 on the die.  Any critical
*threats you score with a spell are automatically confirmed.  Once
*per day, you can automatically succeed at one caster level check
*made to overcome spell resistance.  You must use this ability
*before making the roll.

#### Draconic

At some point in your family's history, a dragon interbred with
your bloodline, and now its ancient power flows through your
veins.

**Class Skill**: [Perception].

**Bonus Spells**: *[mage armor]* (3rd), *[resist energy]* ,
*[fly]* , *[fear]* , *[spell resistance]* , *[form of the dragon
I]*, *[form of the dragon II]* , *[form of the dragon III]*,
*[wish]* .

**Bonus Feats**: [Blind-Fight], [Great Fortitude], [Improved
Initiative], [Power Attack], [Quicken Spell], [Skill Focus]
([Fly]), [Skill Focus] ([Knowledge] [arcana]), [Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy
descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type,
that spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.

**Bloodline Powers**: The power of dragons flows through you and
manifests in a number of ways.  At 1st level, you must select one
of the chromatic or metallic dragon types.  This choice cannot be
changed.  A number of your abilities grant resistances and deal
damage based on your dragon type, as noted on the following
table.

  Dragon Type   Energy Type   Breath Shape
  ------------- ------------- --------------
  Black         Acid          60-foot line
  Blue          Electricity   60-foot line
  Green         Acid          30-foot cone
  Red           Fire          30-foot cone
  White         Cold          30-foot cone
  Brass         Fire          60-foot line
  Bronze        Electricity   60-foot line
  Copper        Acid          60-foot line
  Gold          Fire          30-foot cone
  Silver        Cold          30-foot cone

*Claws*: Starting at 1st level, you can grow claws as a free
action.  These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you
to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full
base attack bonus.  Each of these attacks deals 1d4 points of
damage plus your [Strength] modifier (1d3 if you are Small).  At
5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming [DR].  At 7th level, the damage increases by
one step to 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small).  At 11th
level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of
your energy type on a successful hit.  You can use your claws for
a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma]
modifier.  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Dragon Resistances*: At 3rd level, you gain resist 5 against
your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus.  At 9th level, your
energy resistance increases to 10 and natural armor bonus
increases to +2.  At 15th level, your natural armor bonus
increases to +4.

*Breath Weapon*: At 9th level, you gain a breath weapon.  This
breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of your energy type per
sorcerer level.  Those caught in the area of the breath receive a
[Reflex] save for half damage.  The DC of this save is equal to 10
+ 1/2 your sorcerer level + your [Charisma] modifier.  The shape
of the breath weapon depends on your dragon type (as indicated on
the above chart).  At 9th level, you can use this ability once per
day.  At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.  At
20th level, you can use this ability three times per day.

*Wings* *[*: At 15th level, leathery dragon wings grow from your
back as a standard action, giving you a fly speed of 60 feet with
average maneuverability.  You can dismiss the wings as a free
action.

*Power of Wyrms**: At 20th level, your draconic heritage
*becomes manifest.  You gain immunity to paralysis, sleep, and
*damage of your energy type.  You also gain blindsense 60 feet.

#### Elemental

The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can
hardly control its fury.  This influence comes from an elemental
outsider in your family history or a time when you or your
relatives were exposed to a powerful elemental force.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (planes).

**Bonus Spells**: *[burning hands]*\* (3rd), *[scorching ray]*\*
, *[protection from energy]* , *[elemental body I]* , *[elemental
body II]* , *[elemental body III]* , *[elemental body IV]* ,
*[summon monster VIII]* , *[elemental swarm]* .

\*These spells always deal a type of damage determined by your
element.  In addition, the subtype of these spells changes to
match the energy type of your element.

**Bonus Feats**: [Dodge], [Empower Spell], [Great Fortitude],
[Improved Initiative], [Lightning Reflexes], [Power Attack],
[Skill Focus] ([Knowledge] [planes]), [Weapon Finesse].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy
damage, you can change the type of damage to match the type of
your bloodline.  This also changes the spell's type to match the
type of your bloodline.

**Bloodline Powers**: One of the four elements infuses your
being, and you can draw upon its power in times of need.  At first
level, you must select one of the four elements: air, earth,
fire, or water.  This choice cannot be changed.  A number of your
abilities grant resistances and deal damage based on your
element, as noted below.

  Element   Energy Type   Elemental Movement
  --------- ------------- -----------------------
  Air       Electricity   Fly 60 feet 
  Earth     Acid          Burrow 30 feet
  Fire      Fire          +30 feet base speed
  Water     Cold          Swim 60 feet

*Elemental Ray**: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an
*elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30
*feet as a ranged touch attack.  This ray deals 1d6 points of
*damage of your energy type + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you
*possess.  You can use this ability a number of times per day
*equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

*Elemental Resistance**: At 3rd level, you gain energy
*resistance 10 against your energy type.  At 9th level, your
*energy resistance increases to 20.

*Elemental Blast**: At 9th level, you can unleash a blast of
*elemental power once per day.  This 20-foot-radius burst does
*1d6 points of damage of your energy type per sorcerer
*level.  Those caught in the area of your blast receive a [Reflex]
*save for half damage.  Creatures that fail their saves gain
*vulnerability to your energy type until the end of your next
*turn.  The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer
*level + your [Charisma] modifier.  At 9th level, you can use this
*ability once per day.  At 17th level, you can use this ability
*twice per day.  At 20th level, you can use this ability three
*times per day.  This power has a range of 60 feet.

*Elemental Movement**: At 15th level, you gain a special
*movement type or bonus.  This ability is based on your chosen
*element, as indicated on the above chart.

*Elemental Body*: At 20th level, elemental power surges through
your body.  You gain immunity to sneak attacks, critical hits, and
damage from your energy type.

#### Fey

The capricious nature of the fey runs in your family due to some
intermingling of fey blood or magic.  You are more emotional than
most, prone to bouts of joy and rage.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (nature).

**Bonus Spells**: [entangle]*(3rd), *[hideous laughter]* , *[deep
*slumber]* , *[poison]* , *[tree stride]* , [mislead]* , *[phase
*door]* , [irresistible dance]* , [shapechange]*.

**Bonus Feats**: [Dodge], [Improved Initiative], [Lightning
Reflexes], [Mobility], [Point Blank Shot], [Precise Shot],
[Quicken Spell], [Skill Focus] ([Knowledge] [nature]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[compulsion] subschool, increase the spell's DC by +2.

**Bloodline Powers**: You have always had a tie to the natural
world, and as your power increases, so does the influence of the
fey over your magic.

*Laughing Touch**: At 1st level, you can cause a creature to
*burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack.  A
*laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend
*itself normally.  Once a creature has been affected by laughing
*touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours.  You can use
*this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
*[Charisma] modifier.  This is a mind-affecting effect.

*Woodland Stride**: At 3rd level, you can move through any sort
*of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas,
*and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking
*damage or suffering any other impairment.  Thorns, briars, and
*overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede
*motion, however, still affect you.

*Fleeting Glance**: At 9th level, you can turn [invisible] for
*a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level.  This
*ability functions as *[greater invisibility].*These rounds need
*not be consecutive.

*Fey Magic*: At 15th level, you may reroll any caster level
check made to overcome spell resistance.  You must decide to use
this ability before the results are revealed by the GM.  You must
take the second result, even if it is worse.  You can use this
ability at will.

*Soul of the Fey**: At 20th level, your soul becomes one with
*the world of the fey.  You gain immunity to poison and [DR]
*10/cold iron.  Creatures of the animal type do not attack you
*unless compelled to do so through magic.  Once per day, you can
*cast *[shadow walk]* as a spell-like ability using your sorcerer
*level as your caster level.

#### Infernal

Somewhere in your family's history, a relative made a deal with a
devil, and that pact has influenced your family line ever since.
In you, it manifests in direct and obvious ways, granting you
powers and abilities.  While your fate is still your own, you
can't help but wonder if your ultimate reward is bound to the
Pit.

**Class Skill**: [Diplomacy].

**Bonus Spells**: *[protection from good]* (3rd), *[scorching
ray]* , *[suggestion]* , *[charm monster]* , *[dominate person]*,
*[planar binding]* , *[greater teleport]* , *[power word stun]* ,
*[meteor swarm]* .

**Bonus Feats**: [Blind-Fight], [Combat Expertise], [Deceitful],
[Extend Spell], [Improved Disarm], [Iron Will], [Skill Focus]
([Knowledge] [planes]), [Spell Penetration].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the [charm]
subschool, increase the spell's DC by +2.

**Bloodline Powers**: You can draw upon the power of Hell,
although you must be wary of its corrupting influence.  Such power
does not come without a price.

*Corrupting Touch**: At 1st level, you can cause a creature to
*become [shaken] as a melee touch attack.  This effect persists
*for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level
*.  Creatures [shaken] by this ability radiate an aura of evil, as
*if they were an evil outsider (see *[detect evil]*).  Multiple
*touches do not stack, but they do add to the duration.  You can
*use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
*[Charisma] modifier.

*Infernal Resistances**: At 3rd level, you gain resist fire 5
*and a +2 bonus on [saving throws] made against poison.  At 9th
*level, your resistance to fire increases to 10 and your bonus on
*poison [saving throws] increases to +4.

*Hellfire*: At 9th level, you can call down a column of
hellfire.  This 10-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of fire
damage per sorcerer level.  Those caught in the area of your blast
receive a [Reflex] save for half damage.  Good creatures that fail
their saves are [shaken] for a number of rounds equal to your
sorcerer level.  The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your
sorcerer level + your [Charisma] modifier.  At 9th level, you can
use this ability once per day.  At 17th level, you can use this
ability twice per day.  At 20th level, you can use this ability
three times per day.  This power has a range of 60 feet.

*On Dark Wings**: At 15th level, you can grow fearsome bat
*wings as a standard action, giving you a fly speed of 60 feet
*with average maneuverability.  The wings can be dismissed as a
*free action.

*Power of the Pit**: At 20th level, your form becomes infused
*with vile power.  You gain immunity to fire and poison.  You also
*gain resistance to acid 10 and cold 10, and the ability to see
*perfectly in darkness of any kind to a range of 60 feet.

#### Undead

The taint of the grave runs through your family.  Perhaps one of
your ancestors became a powerful lich or vampire, or maybe you
were born dead before suddenly returning to life.  Either way, the
forces of death move through you and touch your every action.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge] (religion).

**Bonus Spells**: *[chill touch]* (3rd), *[false life]* ,
*[vampiric touch]* , *[animate dead]* , *[waves of fatigue]* ,
*[undeath to death]* , *[finger of death]* , *[horrid wilting]* ,
*[energy drain]* .

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting], [Diehard], [Endurance], [Iron
Will], [Skill Focus] ([Knowledge] [religion]), [Spell Focus],
[Still Spell], [Toughness].

**Bloodline Arcana**: Some undead are susceptible to your
mind-affecting spells.  Corporeal undead that were once humanoids
are treated as humanoids for the purposes of determining which
spells affect them.

**Bloodline Powers**: You can call upon the foul powers of the
afterlife.  Unfortunately, the more you draw upon them, the closer
you come to joining them.

*Grave Touch*: Starting at 1st level, you can make a melee
touch attack as a standard action that causes a living creature
to become [shaken] for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
sorcerer level .  If you touch a [shaken] creature with this
ability, it becomes [frightened] for 1 round if it has fewer Hit
Dice than your sorcerer level.  You can use this ability a number
of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma] modifier.

*Death's Gift**: At 3rd level, you gain resist cold 5 and [DR]
*5/— against nonlethal damage.  At 9th level, your resistance to
*cold increases to 10 and your [DR] increases to 10/— against
*nonlethal damage.

*Grasp of the Dead**: At 9th level, you can cause a swarm of
*skeletal arms to burst from the ground to rip and tear at your
*foes.  The skeletal arms erupt from the ground in a
*20-foot-radius burst.  Anyone in this area takes 1d6 points of
*slashing damage per sorcerer level.  Those caught in the area
*receive a [Reflex] save for half damage.  Those who fail the save
*are unable to move for 1 round.  The DC of this save is equal to
*10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your [Charisma] modifier.  The
*skeletal arms disappear after 1 round.  The arms must burst up
*from a solid surface.  At 9th level, you can use this ability
*once per day.  At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per
*day.  At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per
*day.  This power has a range of 60 feet.

*Incorporeal Form**: At 15th level, you can become
*[incorporeal] for 1 round per sorcerer level.  While in this
*form, you gain the incorporeal subtype.  You only take half
*damage from corporeal sources as long as they are magic (you
*take no damage from non-magic weapons and objects).  Likewise,
*your spells deal only half damage to corporeal creatures.  Spells
*and other effects that do not deal damage function normally.  You
*can use this ability once per day.

*One of Us**: At 20th level, your form begins to rot (the
*appearance of this decay is up to you) and undead see you as one
*of them.  You gain immunity to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis,
*and sleep.  You also gain [DR] 5/—.  Unintelligent undead do not
*notice you unless you attack them.  You receive a +4 morale bonus
*on [saving throws] made against spells and spell-like abilities
*cast by undead.


## Wizard

Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute
power.  The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms
where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous
and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and
the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might.
Such is the path of the wizard.  These shrewd magic-users seek,
collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to
work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals.  While some
might choose a particular field of magical study and become
masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in
the unbounded wonders of all magic.  In either case, wizards prove
a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes,
empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every
desire.

**Role**: While universalist wizards might study to prepare
themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research
schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a
specific focus.  Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are
masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming
any danger.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.

### Wizard Class Skills

([Int]), [Fly] ([Dex]), [Knowledge] (all) ([Int]), [Linguistics]
([Int]), [Profession] ([Wis]), and [Spellcraft] ([Int]).

### Wizard Class Features

The following are the class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Wizards are proficient with the
club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff,
but not with any type of armor or shield.  Armor interferes with a
wizard's movements, which can cause his spells with somatic
components to fail.

**Spells**: A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in [Spell Lists].  A wizard
must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an
[Intelligence] score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.  The
Difficulty Class for a [saving throw] against a wizard's spell is
10 + the spell level + the wizard's [Intelligence] modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell
level per day.  His base daily spell allotment is given on Table:
Wizard.  In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
high [Intelligence] score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and
Bonus Spells]).

A wizard may know any number of spells.  He must choose and
prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and
spending 1 hour studying his spellbook.  While studying, the
wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages**: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of
the bonus languages available to the character because of his
race.

**Arcane Bond **: At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with
an object or a creature.  This bond can take one of two forms: a
[familiar] or a bonded object.  A familiar is a magical pet that
enhances the wizard's skills and senses and can aid him in magic,
while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use to cast
additional spells or to serve as a magical item.  Once a wizard
makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.  Rules
for bonded items are given below, while rules for [familiars] are
at the end of this section.

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no
cost.  Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall
into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand,
or weapon.  These objects are always masterwork quality.  Weapons
acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material.  If
the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect,
while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded.  If a wizard
attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in
hand, he must make a [concentration check] or lose the spell.  The
DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level.  If the
object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot
accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell
that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting,
even if the spell is not prepared.  This spell is treated like any
other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration,
and other effects dependent on the wizard's level.  This spell
cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.  The
bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard's
opposition schools .

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object
as if he has the required [item creation feats] and if he meets
the level prerequisites of the feat.  For example, a wizard with a
bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities
to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in
[Feats]).  If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand
abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not
destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and
can be used to craft a new wand.  The magic properties of a bonded
object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only
function for the wizard who owns it.  If a bonded object's owner
dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an
ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points
the next time the wizard prepares his spells.  If the object of an
arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week
in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the
cost of the masterwork item.  This ritual takes 8 hours to
complete.  Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the
additional enchantments of the previous bonded item.  A wizard can
designate an existing magic item as his bonded item.  This
functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item
except that the new magic item retains its abilities while
gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

**Arcane School**: A wizard can choose to specialize in one
school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on
that school.  This choice must be made at 1st level, and once
made, it cannot be changed.  A wizard that does not select a
school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must
select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing
knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery
in another.  A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition
schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the
spell.  For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition
school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to
prepare a *fireball*.  In addition, a specialist takes a –4
penalty on any [skill checks] made when crafting a magic item
that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a
prerequisite.  A universalist wizard can prepare spells from any
school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers.  In
addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of
each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up.  Each day, a wizard
can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot.  This
spell must be in the wizard's spellbook.  A wizard can select a
spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot,
but it uses up a higher-level spell slot.  Wizards with the
universalist school do not receive a school slot.

**Cantrips:** Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or
0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under “Spells
per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they
are not expended when cast and may be used again.  A wizard can
prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of
his available slots .

**Scribe Scroll**: At 1st level, a wizard gains [Scribe Scroll]
as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats**: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard
gains a bonus feat.  At each such opportunity, he can choose a
[metamagic feat], an [item creation feat], or [Spell
Mastery].  The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a
bonus feat, including caster level minimums.  These bonus feats
are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets
from advancing levels.  The wizard is not limited to the
categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell
Mastery when choosing those feats.

**Spellbooks**: A wizard must study his spellbook each day to
prepare his spells.  He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in
his spellbook, except for *[read magic]*, which all wizards can
prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level
wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any;
see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice.
The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells
equal to his [Intelligence] modifier to add to the spellbook.  At
each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level
or levels that he can cast for his spellbook.  At any time, a
wizard can also add spells found in other wizards' spellbooks to
his own.

#### Arcane Schools 

The following descriptions detail each arcane school and its
corresponding powers.

#### Abjuration School

The abjurer uses magic against itself, and masters the art of
defensive and warding magics.

*Resistance*: You gain resistance 5 to an energy type of your
choice, chosen when you prepare spells.  This resistance can be
changed each day.  At 11th level, this resistance increases to
10.  At 20th level, this resistance changes to immunity to the
chosen energy type.

*Protective Ward*: As a standard action, you can create a
10-foot-radius field of protective magic centered on you that
lasts for a number of rounds equal to your [Intelligence]
modifier.  All allies in this area receive a +1 deflection bonus
to their [AC].  This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard
levels you possess.  You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

*Energy Absorption*: At 6th level, you gain an amount of energy
absorption equal to 3 times your wizard level per day.  Whenever
you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any),
and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption,
reducing your daily total by that amount.  Any damage in excess of
your absorption is applied to you normally.

#### Conjuration School

The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic
alike to bend to his will.

*Summoner's Charm*: Whenever you cast a conjuration
([summoning]) spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds
equal to 1/2 your wizard level .  At 20th level, you can change
the duration of all *summon monster* spells to permanent.  You can
have no more than one *summon monster* spell made permanent in
this way at one time.  If you designate another *[summon
monster]*spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.

*Acid Dart*: As a standard action you can unleash an acid dart
targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack.  The
acid dart deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two
wizard levels you possess.  You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.  This
attack ignores spell resistance.

*Dimensional Steps*: At 8th level, you can use this ability to
teleport up to 30 feet per wizard level per day as a standard
action.  This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and
such movement does not provoke an [attack of opportunity].  You
can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend
an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought
with you.

#### Divination School

Diviners are masters of remote viewing, prophecies, and using
magic to explore the world.

*Forewarned*: You can always act in the surprise round even if
you fail to make a [Perception] roll to notice a foe, but you are
still considered [flat-footed] until you take an action.  In
addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2
your wizard level .  At 20th level, anytime you roll initiative,
assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

*Diviner's Fortune*: When you activate this school power, you
can touch any creature as a standard action to give it an insight
bonus on all of its attack rolls, [skill checks], ability checks,
and [saving throws] equal to 1/2 your wizard level for 1
round.  You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

*Scrying Adept*: At 8th level, you are always aware when you
are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent *[detect
scrying]*.  In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the
subject as one step more familiar to you.  Very familiar subjects
get a –10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.

#### Enchantment School

The enchanter uses magic to control and manipulate the minds of
his victims.

*Enchanting Smile*: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on [Bluff],
[Diplomacy], and [Intimidate] [skill checks].  This bonus
increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, up to a
maximum of +6 at 20th level.  At 20th level, whenever you succeed
at a [saving throw] against a spell of the enchantment school,
that spell is reflected back at its caster, as per *[spell
turning]*.

*Dazing Touch*: You can cause a living creature to become
[dazed] for 1 round as a melee touch attack.  Creatures with more
Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected.  You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence] modifier.

*Aura of Despair*: At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of
despair for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard
level.  Enemies within this aura take a –2 penalty on ability
checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, [saving throws], and [skill
checks].  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.  This is a
mind-affecting effect.

#### Evocation School

Evokers revel in the raw power of magic, and can use it to create
and destroy with shocking ease.

*Intense Spells*: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that
deals hit point damage, add 1/2 your wizard level to the damage
.  This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile
or ray, and cannot be split between multiple missiles or
rays.  This bonus damage is not increased by [Empower Spell] or
similar effects.  This damage is of the same type as the spell.  At
20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll
twice to penetrate a creature's spell resistance and take the
better result.

*Force Missile**: As a standard action you can unleash a force
*missile that automatically strikes a foe, as *[magic
*missile]*.  The force missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the
*damage from your intense spells evocation power.  This is a force
*effect.  You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
*to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

*Elemental Wall*: At 8th level, you can create a wall of
energy that lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your
wizard level.  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.  This
wall deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, determined
when you create it.  The elemental wall otherwise functions like
*[wall of fire]*.

#### Illusion School

Illusionists use magic to weave confounding images, figments, and
phantoms to baffle and vex their foes.

*Extended Illusions*: Any illusion spell you cast with a
duration of “concentration” lasts a number of additional rounds
equal to 1/2 your wizard level after you stop maintaining
concentration .  At 20th level, you can make one illusion spell
with a duration of “concentration” become permanent.  You can have
no more than one illusion made permanent in this way at one
time.  If you designate another illusion as permanent, the
previous permanent illusion ends.

*Blinding Ray*: As a standard action you can fire a shimmering
ray at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack.  The ray
causes creatures to be [blinded] for 1 round.  Creatures with more
Hit Dice than your wizard level are [dazzled] for 1 round
instead.  You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

*Invisibility Field*: At 8th level, you can make yourself
[invisible] as a swift action for a number of rounds per day
equal to your wizard level.  These rounds do not need to be
consecutive.  This otherwise functions as *[greater
invisibility].*

#### Necromancy School

The dread and feared necromancer commands undead and uses the
foul power of unlife against his enemies.

*Power over Undead*: You receive [Command Undead] or [Turn
Undead] as a bonus feat.  You can channel energy a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier, but only to
use the selected feat.  You can take other feats to add to this
ability, such as [Extra Channel] and [Improved Channel], but not
feats that alter this ability, such as [Elemental Channel] and
Alignment[Channel].  The DC to save against these feats is equal
to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your [Charisma] modifier.  At
20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the
save against this ability.

*Grave Touch*: As a standard action, you can make a melee
touch attack that causes a living creature to become [shaken] for
a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level .  If you touch
a [shaken] creature with this ability, it becomes [frightened]
for 1 round if it has fewer Hit Dice than your wizard level.  You
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence] modifier.

*Life Sight*: At 8th level, you gain blindsight to a range of
10 feet for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard
level.  This ability only allows you to detect living creatures
and undead creatures.  This sight also tells you whether a
creature is living or undead.  Constructs and other creatures
that are neither living nor undead cannot be seen with this
ability.  The range of this ability increases by 10 feet at 12th
level, and by an additional 10 feet for every four levels beyond
12th.  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

#### Transmutation School

Transmuters use magic to change the world around them.

*Physical Enhancement*: You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to one
physical ability score ([Strength], [Dexterity], or
[Constitution]).  This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard
levels you possess to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.  You can
change this bonus to a new ability score when you prepare
spells.  At 20th level, this bonus applies to two physical ability
scores of your choice.

*Telekinetic Fist*: As a standard action you can strike with a
telekinetic fist, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged
touch attack.  The telekinetic fist deals 1d4 points of
bludgeoning damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you
possess.  You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Intelligence] modifier.

*Change Shape*: At 8th level, you can change your shape for a
number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level.  These rounds
do not need to be consecutive.  This ability otherwise functions
like *[beast shape II]* or *[elemental body I].* At 12th level,
this ability functions like *[beast shape III]* or *[elemental
body II]*.

#### Universalist School

Wizards who do not specialize have the most diversity of all
arcane spellcasters.

*Hand of the Apprentice*: You cause your melee weapon to fly
from your grasp and strike a foe before instantly returning to
you.  As a standard action, you can make a single attack using a
melee weapon at a range of 30 feet.  This attack is treated as a
ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your
[Intelligence] modifier on the attack roll instead of your
[Dexterity] modifier (damage still relies on [Strength]).  This
ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver.  You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence] modifier.

*Metamagic Mastery*: At 8th level, you can apply any one
[metamagic feat] that you know to a spell you are about to
cast.  This does not alter the level of the spell or the casting
time.  You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one
additional time per day for every two wizard levels you possess
beyond 8th.  Any time you use this ability to apply a metamagic
feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you must use
an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that the feat
adds to the spell.  Even though this ability does not modify the
spell's actual level, you cannot use this ability to cast a spell
whose modified spell level would be above the level of the
highest-level spell that you are capable of casting.

### Familiars

A familiar is an animal chosen by a spellcaster to aid him in his
study of magic.  It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack
bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal
it once was, but is now a magical beast for the purpose of
effects that depend on its type.  Only a normal, unmodified animal
may become a familiar.  An animal companion cannot also function
as a familiar.

A familiar grants special abilities to its master, as given on
the table below.  These special abilities apply only when the
master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack
for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend
on the master's level.

If a familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1
week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per
wizard level.  The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

Familiar

Toad

\*A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice
as a supernatural ability.

**Familiar Basics**: Use the basic statistics for a creature of
the familiar's kind, but with the following changes.

*Hit Dice*: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit
Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal
HD total, whichever is higher.

*Hit Points*: The familiar has half the master's total hit points
(not including [temporary hit points]), rounded down, regardless
of its actual Hit Dice.

*Attacks*: Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from
all his classes.  Use the familiar's [Dexterity] or [Strength]
modifier, whichever is greater, to calculate the familiar's melee
attack bonus with natural weapons.

Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

*Saving Throws*: For each [saving throw], use either the
familiar's base save bonus ([Fortitude] +2, [Reflex] +2, [Will]
+0) or the master's , whichever is better.  The familiar uses its
own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn't share any of the
other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

*Skills*: For each skill in which either the master or the
familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an
animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever is
better.  In either case, the familiar uses its own ability
modifiers.  Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some
skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use.  Familiars
treat [Acrobatics], [Climb], [Fly], [Perception], [Stealth], and
[Swim] as class skills.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions**: All familiars have special
abilities depending on the master's combined level in classes
that grant familiars, as shown on the table below.  The abilities
are cumulative.

  Master Class Level   Natural Armor Adj.   Int   Special
  -------------------- -------------------- ----- -----------------------------------------------------------------
  1st–2nd              +1                   6     [Alertness], [improved evasion], [share spells], [empathic link]
  3rd–4th              +2                   7     [Deliver touch spells]
  5th–6th              +3                   8     [Speak with master]
  7th–8th              +4                   9     [Speak with animals of its kind]
  9th–10th             +5                   10    —
  11th–12th            +6                   11    [Spell resistance]
  13th–14th            +7                   12    [Scry on familiar]
  15th–16th            +8                   13    —
  17th–18th            +9                   14    —
  19th–20th            +10                  15    —

*Natural Armor Adj.*: The number noted here is in addition to the
familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

*Int*: The familiar's [Intelligence] score.

*Alertness*: While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master
gains the [Alertness] feat.

*Improved Evasion*: When subjected to an attack that normally
allows a [Reflex] saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes
no damage if it makes a successful [saving throw] and half damage
even if the [saving throw] fails.

*Share Spells*: The wizard may cast a spell with a target of
“You” on his familiar instead of on himself.  A wizard may cast
spells on his familiar even if the spells do not normally affect
creatures of the familiar's type .

*Empathic Link*: The master has an empathic link with his
familiar to a 1 mile distance.  The master can communicate
empathically with the familiar, but cannot see through its
eyes.  Because of the link's limited nature, only general emotions
can be shared.  The master has the same connection to an item or
place that his familiar does.

*Deliver Touch Spells*: If the master is 3rd level or higher, a
familiar can deliver touch spells for him.  If the master and the
familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch
spell, he can designate his familiar as the “toucher.” The
familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master
would.  As usual, if the master casts another spell before the
touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

*Speak with Master*: If the master is 5th level or higher, a
familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were
using a common language.  Other creatures do not understand the
communication without magical help.

*Speak with Animals of Its Kind*: If the master is 7th level or
higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately
the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with
bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds,
lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with other simians,
rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and weasels with
ermines and minks.  Such communication is limited by the
[Intelligence] of the conversing creatures.

*Spell Resistance*: If the master is 11th level or higher, a
familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master's level +5.
To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get
a result on a caster level check that equals or exceeds the
familiar's spell resistance.

*Scry on Familiar*: If the master is 13th level or higher, he
may scry on his familiar (as if casting the *scrying*spell) once
per day.

### Arcane Spells and Armor

Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting
any spell that has a somatic component.  The [armor and shield
descriptions] list the arcane spell failure chance for different
armors and shields.

If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane
spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while
wearing armor.  Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's
hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks
still apply normally).  The metamagic feat [Still Spell] allows a
spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell without the somatic
component at one spell level higher than normal.  This also
provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without
risking arcane spell failure.
