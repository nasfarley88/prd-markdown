**Fabricate**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** see text

**Components** V, S, M (the original material, which costs the
same amount as the raw materials required to craft the item to be
created)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** up to 10 cu. ft./level; see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You convert material of one sort into a product that is of the
same material. Creatures or magic items cannot be created or
transmuted by the *fabricate*spell. The quality of items made by
this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as
the basis for the new fabrication. If you work with a mineral,
the target is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level instead of 10
cubic feet.

You must make an appropriate Craft check to fabricate articles
requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.

Casting requires 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material to be
affected by the spell.

Faerie Fire

**Faerie Fire**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** druid 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined
subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by *faerie
fire* take a –20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined
creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided
by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical
*darkness*effect functions normally), *[blur](blur.html#_blur)*,
*[displacement](displacement.html#_displacement),
[invisibility](invisibility.html#_invisibility),* or similar
effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on
undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The
*faerie fire*can be blue, green, or violet, according to your
choice at the time of casting. The *faerie fire*does not cause
any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

False Life

**False Life**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of blood)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level or until discharged; see text

You harness the power of unlife to grant yourself a limited
ability to avoid death. While this spell is in effect, you gain
temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + 1 per caster level (maximum
+10).

False Vision

**False Vision**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (crushed jade worth 250 gp)

**Range** touch

**Area** 40-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell creates a subtle illusion, causing any divination
(scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this
spell to instead receive a false image (as the *[major
image](majorImage.html#_major-image)*spell), as defined by you at
the time of casting. As long as the duration lasts, you can
concentrate to change the image as desired. While you aren't
concentrating, the image remains static.

Fear

**Fear**

**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (the heart of a hen or a white feather)

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

An invisible cone of terror causes each living creature in the
area to become [panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) unless it
succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save. If cornered, a
[panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) creature begins cowering.
If the [Will](../combat.html#_will) save succeeds, the creature
is [shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for 1 round.

Feather Fall

**Feather Fall**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 immediate action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one Medium or smaller freefalling object or
creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart

**Duration** until landing or 1 round/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless)
or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (object)

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. *Feather
fall*instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a
mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a
few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the
spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal
rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures
(including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum
load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large
creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a
Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or
objects, and so forth.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they
are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling
item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight,
with no bonus for the height of the drop.

*Feather fall*works only upon free-falling objects. It does not
affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

Feeblemind

**Feeblemind**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, or glass
spheres)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Target creature's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) and
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) scores each drop
to 1. The affected creature is unable to use
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)- or
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based skills,
cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.
Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even
protect them. The subject remains in this state until a
*[heal](heal.html#_heal)*, *[limited
wish](limitedWish.html#_limited-wish)*,
*[miracle](miracle.html#_miracle)*, or
*[wish](wish.html#_wish)*spell is used to cancel the effect of
the *feeblemind*. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as
a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.

Find the Path

**Find the Path**

**School**divination; **Level**bard 6, cleric 6, druid 6

**Casting Time**3 rounds

**Components**V, S, F (a set of divination counters)

**Range**personal or touch

**Target**you or creature touched

**Duration**10 min./level

**Saving Throw**none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**no or yes
(harmless)

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a prominent specified destination, such as a
city, keep, lake, or dungeon. The locale can be outdoors or
underground, as long as it is prominent. For example, a hunter's
cabin is not prominent enough, but a logging camp is. *Find the
path*works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at
a locale. The location must be on the same plane as the subject
at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that
will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at
appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to
take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense what
cavern corridor to take when a choice presents itself*.*The spell
ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires,
whichever comes first. *Find the path*can be used to remove the
subject and its companions from the effect of a
*[maze](maze.html#_maze)*spell in a single round, specifying the
destination as “outside the [maze](maze.html#_maze).” This
divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its
effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures
(including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster
as he follows the path revealed by this spell.

Find Traps

**Find Traps**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 min./level

You gain intuitive insight into the workings of traps. You gain
an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level (maximum +10) on
Perception checks made to find traps while the spell is in
effect. You receive a check to notice traps within 10 feet of
you, even if you are not actively searching for them. Note that
*find traps*grants no ability to disable the traps that you may
find.

Finger of Death

**Finger of Death**

**School** necromancy [death]; **Level** druid 8, sorcerer/wizard
7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell instantly delivers 10 points of damage per caster
level. If the target's [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude)
saving throw succeeds, it instead takes 3d6 points of damage + 1
point per caster level. The subject might die from damage even if
it succeeds on its saving throw.

Fireball

**Fireball**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A *fireball*spell generates a searing explosion of flame that
detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per
caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area.
Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates
almost no pressure.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and
height) at which the *fireball*is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized
bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon
a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the
prescribed range, blossoms into the *fireball*at that point. An
early impact results in an early detonation. If you attempt to
send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow
slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or
else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The *fireball*sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in
the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as
lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to
an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the
*fireball*may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits;
otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect
does.

Fire Seeds

**Fire Seeds**

**School** conjuration (creation) [fire]; **Level** druid 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (acorns or holly berries)

**Range** touch

**Targets** up to four acorns or up to eight holly berries

**Duration** 10 min./level or until used

**Saving Throw** none or [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

Depending on the version of *fire seeds*you choose, you turn
acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can
throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate
on command.

*Acorn Grenades*: As many as four acorns turn into special thrown
splash weapons. An acorn grenade has a range increment of 20
feet. A ranged touch attack roll is required to strike the
intended target. Together, the acorns are capable of dealing 1d4
points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d4) divided
among the acorns as you wish. No acorn can deal more than 10d4
points of damage.

Each acorn grenade explodes upon striking any hard surface. In
addition to its regular fire damage, all creatures adjacent to
the explosion take 1 point of fire damage per die of the
explosion. This explosion of fire ignites any combustible
materials adjacent to the target.

*Holly Berry Bombs*: You turn as many as eight holly berries into
special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand,
since they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they
can be tossed only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak
a word of command, each berry instantly bursts into flame,
causing 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level to
every creature in a 5-foot-radius burst and igniting any
combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature in the area that
makes a successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving throw
takes only half damage.

Fire Shield

**Fire Shield**

**School** evocation [fire or cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (phosphorus for the *warm shield;*a
firefly or glowworm for the *chill shield)*

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each
creature that attacks you in melee. The flames also protect you
from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you
choose cool or warm flames for your *fire shield*.

Any creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon
deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6
points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). This
damage is either cold damage (if you choose a *chill shield*) or
fire damage (if you choose a *warm shield*). If the attacker has
[spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance), it
applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with
reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the
flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10
feet by one step, up to normal light. The color of the flames is
blue or green if the *chill shield*is cast, violet or red if the
*warm shield*is employed. The special powers of each version are
as follows.

*Chill Shield*: The flames are cool to the touch. You take only
half damage from fire-based attacks. If such an attack allows a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage, you take
no damage on a successful saving throw.

*Warm Shield*: The flames are warm to the touch. You take only
half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage, you take
no damage on a successful saving throw.

Fire Storm

**Fire Storm**

**School**evocation [fire]; **Level**cleric 8, druid 7

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area**two 10-ft. cubes per level (S)

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**yes

When a *fire storm*spell is cast, the whole area is shot through
with sheets of roaring flame. The raging flames do not harm
natural vegetation, ground cover, or any plant creatures in the
area that you wish to exclude from damage. Any other creature
within the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level
(maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save catch on fire, taking 4d6
points of fire damage each round until the flames are
extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action
that requires a DC 20 [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save.

Fire Trap

**Fire Trap**

**School** abjuration [fire]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard
4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Duration** permanent until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Fire trap*creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the
item that the trap protects. A *fire trap*spell can ward any
object that can be opened and closed.

When casting *fire trap,*you select a point on the object as the
spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a
fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the
spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1
point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the
trap is not harmed by this explosion.

A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell
placed on it. A *[knock](knock.html#_knock)*spell does not bypass
a *fire trap*. An unsuccessful *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*spell does not detonate
the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a
large cloud of steam.

You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as
can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned
when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual
usually involves setting a password that you can share with
friends.

Magic traps such as *fire trap*are hard to detect and disable. A
character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a
*fire trap*and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case
is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's *fire trap*or DC 29 for
the arcane version).

Flame Arrow

**Flame Arrow**

**School** transmutation [fire]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of oil and a small piece of flint)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** fifty projectiles, all of which must be together at
the time of casting

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell allows you to turn ammunition (such as arrows,
crossbow bolts, shuriken, and sling stones) into fiery
projectiles. Each piece of ammunition deals an extra 1d6 points
of fire damage to any target it hits. A flaming projectile can
easily ignite a flammable object or structure, but it won't
ignite a creature it strikes.

Flame Blade

**Flame Blade**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** sword-like beam

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from
your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a
scimitar. Attacks with the *flame blade*are melee touch attacks.
The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two
caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier does not
apply to the damage. A *flame blade*can ignite combustible
materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

Flame Strike

**Flame Strike**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** cleric 5, druid 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40-ft. high)

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A *flame strike*evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The
spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).
Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results
directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being
reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

Flaming Sphere

**Flaming Sphere**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (tallow, brimstone, and powdered iron)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 5-ft.-diameter sphere

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point
and burns those it strikes. It moves 30 feet per round. As part
of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a
target. If it enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for
the round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to that creature,
though a successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save negates
that damage. A *flaming sphere*rolls over barriers less than 4
feet tall. It ignites flammable substances it touches and
illuminates the same area as a torch would.

The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action
for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns. It can be
extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its
size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding
consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It
cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large
obstacles. A *flaming sphere*winks out if it exceeds the spell's
range.

Flare

**Flare**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** bard 0, druid 0,
sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** burst of light

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to
burst in front of a single creature, that creature is
[dazzled](../glossary.html#_dazzled) for 1 minute unless it makes
a successful [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save.
Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already
[dazzled](../glossary.html#_dazzled), are not affected by
*flare*.

Flesh to Stone

**Flesh to Stone**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (lime, water, and earth)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a
mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell
is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its
original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature
is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed
with spells such as *deathwatch*.

Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

Floating Disk

**Floating Disk**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** 3-ft.-diameter disk of force

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that
follows you about and carries loads for you. The disk is 3 feet
in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 100 pounds
of weight per caster level. If used to transport a liquid, its
capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above
the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along
horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate
of no more than your normal speed each round. If not otherwise
directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between
itself and you. The disk winks out of existence when the spell
duration expires. The disk also winks out if you move beyond its
range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the
surface beneath it. When the disk winks out, whatever it was
supporting falls to the surface beneath it.

Fly

**Fly**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a wing feather)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears
medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load).
It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its
maneuverability is good. Using a *fly*spell requires only as much
concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast
spells normally. The subject of a *fly*spell can charge but not
run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load,
plus any armor it wears. The subject gains a bonus on
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly) skill checks equal to 1/2 your
caster level.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still
aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60
feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that
amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the
distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since
dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends
safely in this way if the *fly*spell is dispelled, but not if it
is negated by an *[antimagic
field](antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field)*.

Fog Cloud

**Fog Cloud**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** druid 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)

**Effect** fog spreads in 20-ft. radius

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog
obscures all sight, including
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A
creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss
chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss
chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong
wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

Forbiddance

**Forbiddance**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 6

**Casting Time** 6 rounds

**Components** V, S, M (holy water and incense worth 1,500 gp,
plus 1,500 gp per 60-foot cube), DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 60-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Forbiddance*seals an area against all planar travel into or
within it. This includes all teleportation spells (such as
*[dimension door](dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door)*and
*[teleport](teleport.html#_teleport)),*[plane
shift](planeShift.html#_plane-shift)ing*,*astral travel, ethereal
travel, and all summoning spells. Such effects simply fail
automatically.

In addition, it damages entering creatures whose alignments are
different from yours. The effect on those attempting to enter the
warded area is based on their alignment relative to yours (see
below). A creature inside the area when the spell is cast takes
no damage unless it exits the area and attempts to reenter, at
which time it is affected as normal.

*Alignments identical*: No effect. The creature may enter the
area freely (although not by planar travel).

*Alignments different with respect to either law/chaos or
good/evil*: The creature takes 6d6 points of damage. A successful
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save halves the damage, and [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applies.

*Alignments different with respect to both law/chaos and
good/evil*: The creature takes 12d6 points of damage. A
successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save halves the damage,
and [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)
applies.

At your option, the abjuration can include a password, in which
case creatures of alignments different from yours can avoid the
damage by speaking the password as they enter the area. You must
select this option (and the password) at the time of casting.
Adding a password requires the burning of additional rare
incenses worth at least 1,000 gp, plus 1,000 gp per 60-foot cube.

*[Dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*does not dispel a
*forbiddance*effect unless the dispeller's level is at least as
high as your caster level.

You can't have multiple overlapping *forbiddance*effects. In such
a case, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older
effect.

Forcecage

**Forcecage**

**School**evocation [force]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (ruby dust worth 500 gp)

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area**barred cage (20-ft. cube) or windowless cell (10-ft.
cube)

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**no

This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed
of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they
are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically
fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a
means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the
Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Like a *[wall of force](wallOfForce.html#_wall-of-force)*, a
*forcecage* resists *[dispel
magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic),*although a *[mage's
disjunction](mageSDisjunction.html#_mage-s-disjunction)* still
functions*.*The walls of a *forcecage*can be damaged by spells as
normal, except for
*[disintegrate](disintegrate.html#_disintegrate),*which
automatically destroys it. The walls of a *forcecage* can be
damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a
Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster
level. Contact with a *[sphere of
annihilation](../magicItems/artifacts.html#_sphere-of-annihilation)*or
*[rod of
cancellation](../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation)*
instantly destroys a *forcecage.*

*Barred Cage*: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube
made of bands of force (similar to a *[wall of
force](wallOfForce.html#_wall-of-force)*spell) for bars. The
bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any
creature capable of passing through such a small space can
escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't
attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the
weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons
(including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the
barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass
through the gaps in the bars.

*Windowless Cell*: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot
cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its
six sides.

Forceful Hand

**Forceful Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*, except that it
can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The
*forceful hand* gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its
[CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) for bull rush checks
uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a
+8 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)
score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves
with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no
movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new
target is a move action. *Forceful hand*prevents the opponent
from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush
attack, moving both the *forceful*hand and the target closer to
you. The *forceful hand* can instead be directed to interpose
itself, as *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)* does.

Foresight

**Foresight**

**School** divination; **Level** druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a hummingbird's feather)

**Range** personal or touch

**Target** see text

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no or yes
(harmless)

This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to
yourself or another. Once *foresight*is cast, you receive
instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject
of the spell. You are never surprised or
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed). In addition, the
spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to
best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and on
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saves. This insight bonus is
lost whenever you would lose a
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class).

When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive
warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn
to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the
creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a
warning. Shouting a warning, yanking a person back, and even
telepathically communicating (via an appropriate spell) can all
be accomplished before some danger befalls the subject, provided
you act on the warning without delay. The subject, however, does
not gain the insight bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class)
and [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saves.

Form of the Dragon

**Form of the Dragon I**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (a scale of the dragon type you plan to
assume)

**Range**personal

weapon, and resistance to one element. You also gain one bite
(1d8), two claws (1d6), and two wing attacks (1d4). Your breath
weapon and resistance depend on the type of dragon. You can only
use the breath weapon once per casting of this spell. All breath
weapons deal 6d8 points of damage and allow a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage. In
addition, some of the dragon types grant additional abilities, as
noted below.

*Black dragon*: 60-foot line of acid, resist acid 20, swim 60

**Form of the Dragon II**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as *[form of the dragon
I](#form-of-the-dragon-i)*except that it also allows you to
assume the form of a Large chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain
the following abilities: a +6 size bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength), a +4 size bonus to
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), a +6
natural armor bonus, fly 90 feet (poor),
[darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) 60 feet, a breath
weapon, [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/magic, and
resistance to one element. You also gain one bite (2d6), two
claws (1d8), two wing attacks (1d6), and one tail slap attack
(1d8). You can only use the breath weapon twice per casting of
this spell, and you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath
weapons deal 8d8 points of damage and allow a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage. Line
breath weapons increase to 80-foot lines and cones increase to
40-foot cones.

**Form of the Dragon III**

**School**transmutation (polymorph); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 8

This spell functions as *[form of the dragon
II](#form-of-the-dragon-ii)*save that it also allows you to take
the form of a Huge chromatic or metallic dragon. You gain the
following abilities: a +10 size bonus to
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength), a +8 size bonus to

feet, [darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) 120 feet, a
breath weapon, [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 10/magic,
frightful presence (DC equal to the DC for this spell), and
immunity to one element (of the same type *[form of the dragon
I](#form-of-the-dragon-i)*grants resistance to). You also gain
one bite (2d8), two claws (2d6), two wing attacks (1d8), and one
tail slap attack (2d6). You can use the breath weapon as often as
you like, but you must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. All breath
weapons deal 12d8 points of damage and allow a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage. Line
breath weapons increase to 100-foot lines and cones increase to
50-foot cones.

Fox's Cunning

**Fox's Cunning**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (hairs or dung from a fox)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement
bonus to [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence),
adding the usual benefits to
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)-based skill
checks and other uses of the
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.
Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)) affected by
this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the
increased [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence),
but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's
effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks.

**Fox's Cunning, Mass**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[fox's cunning](#fox-s-cunning)*,
except that it affects multiple creatures.

Freedom

**Freedom**

**School** abjuration; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) or see text

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The subject is freed from spells and effects that restrict
movement, including *[binding](binding.html#_binding)*,
*[entangle](entangle.html#_entangle)*, grappling,
*[imprisonment](imprisonment.html#_imprisonment)*,
*[maze](maze.html#_maze)*, paralysis, petrification, pinning,
*[sleep](sleep.html#_sleep)*, *[slow](slow.html#_slow)*,
stunning, *[temporal
stasis](temporalStasis.html#_temporal-stasis)*, and
*[web](web.html#_web)*. To free a creature from
*[imprisonment](imprisonment.html#_imprisonment)*or
*[maze](maze.html#_maze),*you must know its name and background,
and you must cast this spell at the spot where it was entombed or
banished into the *[maze](maze.html#_maze)*.

Freedom of Movement

**Freedom of Movement**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4,
ranger 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a leather strip bound to the target), DF

**Range** personal or touch

**Target** you or creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(harmless)

This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack
normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence
of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis,
*[solid fog](solidFog.html#_solid-fog)*,
*[slow](slow.html#_slow)*, and *[web](web.html#_web)*. All combat
maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail.
The subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks
and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally
while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and
swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and
maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather
than hurled. The *freedom of movement*spell does not, however,
grant [water breathing](waterBreathing.html#_water-breathing).

Freezing Sphere

**Freezing Sphere**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a small crystal sphere)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Target, Effect, or Area** see text

**Duration** instantaneous or 1 round/level; see text

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Freezing sphere*creates a frigid globe of cold energy that
streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it
explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold
damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the
area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of
cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) for 1d4 rounds.

If the *freezing sphere*strikes a body of water or a liquid that
is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it
freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches in a 40-foot radius.
This ice lasts for 1 round per caster level. Creatures that were
swimming on the surface of a targeted body of water become
trapped in the ice. Attempting to break free is a full-round
action. A trapped creature must make a DC 25
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) check or a DC 25
Escape Artist check to do so.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell,
if you wish. Treat this as a touch spell for which you are
holding the charge. You can hold the charge for as long as 1
round per level, at the end of which time the *freezing
sphere*bursts centered on you (and you receive no saving throw to
resist its effect). Firing the globe in a later round is a
standard action.
