**Call Lightning**

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** druid 3

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** one or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round
thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long,
vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity
damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke
at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range
(measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the
target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.

You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions,
even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the
first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell)
to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to
your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).

If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds
and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including
a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least
Large size)—each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage
instead of 3d6.

This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.

Call Lightning Storm

**Call Lightning Storm**

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** druid 5

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

This spell functions like *[call
lightning](callLightning.html#_call-lightning)*, except that each
bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (or 5d10 if created
outdoors in a stormy area), and you may call a maximum of 15
bolts.

Calm Animals

**Calm Animals**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
druid 1, ranger 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** animals within 30 ft. of each other

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and
harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) scores of 1
or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of
the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The
maximum number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 +
caster level.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or
flee. They are not [helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) and
defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the
spell on the threatened creatures.

Calm Emotions

**Calm Emotions**

**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 2, cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the
affected creatures, but *calm emotions*can stop raging creatures
from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected
cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves)
or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or
damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on
all calmed creatures.

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any
morale bonuses granted by spells such as
*[bless](bless.html#_bless), [good
hope](goodHope.html#_good-hope),*and
*[rage](rage.html#_rage),*and also negates a bard's ability to
inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses
any fear effects and removes the
*[confused](../glossary.html#_confused)*condition from all
targets*.*While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition,
or effect has no effect. When the *calm emotions*spell ends, the
original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again,
provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Cat's Grace

**Cat's Grace**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (pinch of cat fur)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and
coordinated. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), adding the usual
benefits to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class),
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saves, and other uses of the
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) modifier.

**Cat's Grace, Mass**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 6, druid 6,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[cat's grace](#cat-s-grace)*, except
that it affects multiple creatures.

Cause Fear

**Cause Fear**

**School** necromancy [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1,
cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature with 5 or fewer HD

**Duration** 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The affected creature becomes
[frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened). If the subject
succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save, it is
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for 1 round. Creatures with 6
or more HD are immune to this effect. *Cause fear*counters and
dispels *remove fear*.

Chain Lightning

**Chain Lightning**

**School** evocation [electricity]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or
a crystal rod; plus one silver pin per caster level)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Targets** one primary target, plus one secondary target/level
(each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary target)

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a
single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike *[lightning
bolt](lightningBolt.html#_lightning-bolt)*, *chain
lightning*strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to
other targets.

The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level
(maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning
can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster
level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target
and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.

Each target can attempt a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving
throw for half damage. The [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) DC to
halve the damage of the secondary bolts is 2 lower than the DC to
halve the damage of the primary bolt. You choose secondary
targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the
primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You
can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

Changestaff

**Changestaff**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S, F (a quarterstaff that has been carved and
polished for 28 days)

**Range** touch

**Target** your touched staff

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You change a specially prepared quarterstaff into a Huge
treant-like creature, about 24 feet tall. When you plant the end
of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to
conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a
creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The
staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However,
it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual
treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or
fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is
destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when
the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and
it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The
staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any
wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.

Chaos Hammer

**Chaos Hammer**

**School** evocation [chaotic]; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous (1d6 rounds); see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You unleash chaotic power to smite your enemies. The power takes
the form of a multicolored explosion of leaping, ricocheting
energy. Only lawful and neutral (not chaotic) creatures are
harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels
(maximum 5d8) to lawful creatures (or 1d6 points of damage per
caster level, maximum 10d6, to lawful outsiders) and slows them
for 1d6 rounds (see the *[slow](slow.html#_slow)* spell). A
successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save reduces the damage
by half and negates the [slow](slow.html#_slow) effect.

The spell deals only half damage against creatures who are
neither lawful nor chaotic, and they are not slowed. Such a
creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to
one-quarter) with a successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save.

Charm Animal

**Charm Animal**

**School** enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** druid
1, ranger 1

**Target** one animal

This spell functions like *charm person*, except that it affects
a creature of the animal type.

Charm Monster

**Charm Monster**

**School** enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard
3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 day/level

This spell functions like *charm person*, except that the effect
is not restricted by creature type or size.

**Charm Monster, Mass**

**School** enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard
6, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components** V

**Targets** One or more creatures, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 day/level

This spell functions like *[charm
monster](#charm-monster),*except that *mass charm monster*affects
a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your
level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are
more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one
at a time until you must choose a creature with too many HD to
affect.

Charm Person

**Charm Person**

**School** enchantment (charm) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard
1, sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one humanoid creature

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted
friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the
creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your
allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if
it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in
the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders,
but you must win an opposed
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) check to
convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries
are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or
obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your
apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the
spell. You must speak the person's language to communicate your
commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

Chill Metal

**Chill Metal**

**School** transmutation [cold]; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two
of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of
metal/level, none of which can be more than 30 ft. away from any
of the rest

**Duration** 7 rounds

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

*Chill metal*makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical
metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving
throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses
the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It
takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected.
The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the
table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and
uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also
occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. During the
second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes
pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the
metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the
table below.

  Round   Metal Temperature   Damage
  ------- ------------------- ------------
  1       Cold                None
  2       Icy                 1d4 points
  3–5     Freezing            2d4 points
  6       Icy                 1d4 points
  7       Cold                None

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold
damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point
basis. Underwater, *chill metal*deals no damage, but ice
immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if
unattended.

*Chill metal*counters and dispels *[heat
metal](heatMetal.html#_heat-metal)*.

Chill Touch

**Chill Touch**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Targets** creature or creatures touched (up to one/level)

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial
or [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts
the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative
energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also
takes 1 point of [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)
damage unless it makes a successful
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) saving throw. You can use
this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but
it must make a successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) saving
throw or flee as if [panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) for
1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

Circle of Death

**Circle of Death**

**School** necromancy [death]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a crushed black pearl worth 500 gp)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area** several living creatures within a 40-ft.-radius burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Circle of death*snuffs out the life force of living creatures,
killing them instantly. The spell slays 1d4 HD worth of living
creatures per caster level (maximum 20d4). Creatures with the
fewest HD are affected first; among creatures with equal HD,
those who are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected
first. No creature of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that
are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Clairaudience/Clairvoyance

**Clairaudience/Clairvoyance**

**School** divination (scrying); **Level** bard 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a small horn or a glass eye)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect**magical sensor

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

*Clairaudience/clairvoyance*creates an invisible magical sensor
at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your
choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight
or line of effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar
to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the
sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to
view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell
does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to
work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see
nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot
radius around the center of the spell's effect.
*Clairaudience/clairvoyance*functions only on the plane of
existence you are currently occupying.

Clenched Fist

**Clenched Fist**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a leather glove)

This spell functions like *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand),*except that the
hand can also push or strike one opponent that you select. The
floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the
same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to
notice or attack [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) or
concealed creatures is no better than yours.

The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your
caster level + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence),
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom), or
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier (for a
wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively) + 11 for the hand's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score (33), – 1 for
being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each
attack, and any creature struck must make a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save (against this spell's
save DC) or be [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round.
Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The *clenched fist*can also interpose itself as *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*does, or it can
bull rush an opponent as *[forceful
hand](forcefulHand.html#_forceful-hand)*does. Its
[CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) for bull rush checks
uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a
+11 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)
score and a +1 bonus for being Large.

Cloak of Chaos

**Cloak of Chaos**

**School** abjuration [chaotic]; **Level** cleric 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a tiny reliquary worth 500 gp)

**Range** 20 ft.

**Targets** one creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered
on you

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them
from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful
creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects
to become *[confused](../glossary.html#_confused).*This
abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and a +4 resistance bonus on
saves. Unlike *[protection from
law](protectionFromLaw.html#_protection-from-law)*, the benefit
of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against
attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) 25 against lawful
spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental
influence, just as *[protection from
law](protectionFromLaw.html#_protection-from-law)*does.

Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against
a warded creature, the offending attacker is
*[confused](../glossary.html#_confused)*for 1 round
([Will](../combat.html#_will) save negates, as with the
*[confusion](confusion.html#_confusion)*spell, but against the
save DC of *cloak of chaos*).

Clone

**Clone**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (laboratory supplies worth 1,000 gp), F
(special laboratory equipment costing 500 gp)

**Range** 0 ft.

**Effect** one clone

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the
original individual has been slain, its soul immediately
transfers to the clone, creating a replacement (provided that the
soul is free and willing to return). The original's physical
remains, should they still exist, become inert and cannot
thereafter be restored to life. If the original creature has
reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has died of
natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.

To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not
hair, nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1
cubic inch that was taken from the original creature's living
body. The piece of flesh need not be fresh, but it must be kept
from rotting. Once the spell is cast, the duplicate must be grown
in a laboratory for 2d4 months.

When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it
immediately, if that creature is already dead. The clone is
physically identical to the original and possesses the same
personality and memories as the original. In other respects,
treat the clone as if it were the original character raised from
the dead, including its gaining of two permanent [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels), just
as if it had been hit by an energy-draining creature. If the
subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) drain
instead (if this would reduce its
[Con](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) to 0 or less, it
can't be cloned). If the original creature gained permanent
[negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) since
the flesh sample was taken, the clone gains these [negative
levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) as
well.

The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its
equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still
lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the
resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots
if not preserved.

Cloudkill

**Cloudkill**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a *[fog
cloud](fogCloud.html),*except that its vapors are yellowish green
and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living
creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4
to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save (in which case it
takes 1d4 points of
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) damage on
your turn each round while in the cloud).

A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) damage on
your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save halves this damage).
Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison
are unaffected by the spell.

Unlike a *[fog cloud](fogCloud.html)*, the *cloudkill*moves away
from you at 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the
ground.

Figure out the cloud's new spread each round based on its new
point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from the point of
origin where you cast the spell.

Because the vapors are heavier than air, they sink to the lowest
level of the land, even pouring down den or sinkhole openings. It
cannot penetrate liquids, nor can it be cast underwater.

Color Spray

**Color Spray**

**School** illusion (pattern) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (red, yellow, and blue powder or colored
sand)

**Range** 15 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand,
causing creatures to become [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned),
perhaps also [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded), and possibly
knocking them [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious). Each
creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

*2 HD or less*: The creature is
[unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious),
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded), and
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 2d4 rounds, then
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) and
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1d4 rounds, and then
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round. (Only living
creatures are knocked
[unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious).)

*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded)
and [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1d4 rounds, then
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round.

*5 or more HD*: The creature is
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.

Command

**Command**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best
of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from
the following options.

*Approach*: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly
and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing
but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity
for this movement as normal.

*Drop*: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It
can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

*Fall*: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains
[prone](../glossary.html#_prone) for 1 round. It may act normally
while [prone](../glossary.html#_prone) but takes any appropriate
penalties.

*Flee*: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly
as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its
turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as
normal.

*Halt*: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take
any actions but is not considered
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless).

If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the
spell automatically fails.

**Command, Greater**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent,
mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 5

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

This spell functions like *[command](#command),*except that up to
one creature per level may be affected, and the activities
continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded
creature's action after the first, it gets another
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save to attempt to break free from
the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.

Command Plants

**Command Plants**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 4, ranger 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell allows you some degree of control over one or more
plant creatures. Affected plant creatures can understand you, and
they perceive your words and actions in the most favorable way
(treat their attitude as friendly). They will not attack you
while the spell lasts. You can try to give a subject orders, but
you must win an opposed
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) check to
convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries
are not allowed.) A commanded plant never obeys suicidal or
obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
something very dangerous is worth doing.

You can affect a number of plant creatures whose combined level
or HD do not exceed twice your level.

Command Undead

**Command Undead**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a shred of raw meat and a splinter of
bone)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one undead creature

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell allows you a degree of control over an undead
creature. If the subject is intelligent, it perceives your words
and actions favorably (treat its attitude as friendly). It will
not attack you while the spell lasts. You can give the subject
orders, but you must win an opposed
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) check to
convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. Retries are
not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys suicidal
or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
something very dangerous is worth doing.

A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw against
this spell. When you control a mindless being, you can
communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,”
“fight,” “stand still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won't
resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.

Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the
commanded undead (regardless of its
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)) breaks the
spell.

Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be
able to hear you.

Commune

**Commune**

**School** divination; **Level** cleric 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (holy or unholy water and incense worth
500 gp), DF

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You contact your deity—or agents thereof—and ask questions that
can be answered by a simple yes or no. (A cleric of no particular
deity contacts a philosophically allied deity.) You are allowed
one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct
within the limits of the entity's knowledge. “Unclear” is a
legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes
are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer
would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short
phrase (five words or less) may be given as an answer instead.

The spell, at best, provides information to aid character
decisions. The entities contacted structure their answers to
further their own purposes. If you lag, discuss the answers, or
go off to do anything else, the spell ends.

Commune with Nature

**Commune with Nature**

**School** divination; **Level** druid 5, ranger 4

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

You become one with nature, attaining knowledge of the
surrounding territory. You instantly gain knowledge of as many as
three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or
terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general
animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of
powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the
natural setting.

In outdoor settings, the spell operates in a radius of 1 mile per
caster level. In natural underground settings—caves, caverns, and
the like—the spell is less powerful, and its radius is limited to
100 feet per caster level. The spell does not function where
nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as
in dungeons and towns.

Comprehend Languages

**Comprehend Languages**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 1, cleric 1,
sorcerer/wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (pinch of soot and salt)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 10 min./level

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read
otherwise incomprehensible written messages. The ability to read
does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its
literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an
unknown language, not speak or write it.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words)
per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell
reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain
warding magic (such as the *[secret
page](secretPage.html#_secret-page)*and *[illusory
script](illusoryScript.html#_illusory-script)*spells). It does
not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise
normal text.

*Comprehend languages*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency](permanency.html#_permanency)*spell.

Cone of Cold

**Cone of Cold**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) half; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

*Cone of cold*creates an area of extreme cold, originating at
your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat,
dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum
15d6).

Confusion

**Confusion**

**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting];
**Level**bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M/DF (three nutshells)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets**all creatures in a 15-ft.-radius burst

**Duration**1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell causes confusion in the targets*,*making them unable
to determine their actions. Roll on the following table at the
start of each subject's turn each round to see what it does in
that round.

  d%       Behavior
  -------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  01–25    Act normally
  26–50    Do nothing but babble incoherently
  51–75    Deal 1d8 points of damage + [Str](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier to self with item in hand
  76–100   Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self)

A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action
does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any
special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any
confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its
attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when
its turn comes. Note that a confused character will not make
attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not
already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent
action or because it has just been attacked).

**Confusion, Lesser**

**School**enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting];
**Level**bard 1

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, DF

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one living creature

**Duration**1 round

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell causes a single creature to become
[confused](../glossary.html#_confused) for 1 round.

Consecrate

**Consecrate**

**School** evocation [good]; **Level** cleric 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a vial of holy water and 25 gp worth of
silver dust), DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 2 hours/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell blesses an area with positive energy. The DC to resist
positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred
bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers
minor disruption, suffering a –1 penalty on attack rolls, damage
rolls, and saves. Undead cannot be created within or summoned
into a consecrated area. If the consecrated area contains an
altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture dedicated to your
deity, pantheon, or aligned higher power, the modifiers given
above are doubled (+6 sacred bonus to positive channeled energy
DCs, –2 penalties for undead in the area).

You cannot consecrate an area with a similar fixture of a deity
other than your own patron. Instead, the *consecrate*spell curses
the area, cutting off its connection with the associated deity or
power. This secondary function, if used, does not also grant the
bonuses and penalties relating to undead, as given above.

*Consecrate*counters and dispels
*[desecrate](desecrate.html#_desecrate)*.

Contact Other Plane

**Contact Other Plane**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** concentration

You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental
Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice
and information from powers there. See the accompanying table for
possible consequences and results of the attempt. The powers
reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact
and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are
answered with “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or
some other one-word answer.

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (a standard action)
in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A
question is answered by the power during the same round. You may
ask one question for every two caster levels.

Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the
probability that you will incur a decrease in
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) and
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) due to your
brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the
power knowing the answer and answering correctly. Once the Outer
Planes are reached, the power of the deity contacted determines
the effects. (Random results obtained from the table are subject
to the personalities of individual deities.) On rare occasions,
this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or
forces.

*Avoid Int/[Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) Decrease*:
You must succeed on an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) check
against this DC to avoid a decrease in
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) and
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new). If the check
fails, your [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
and [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) scores each
fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast
arcane spells. You cannot take 10 on this check. If you lose
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) and
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new), the effect
strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is
received. If a successful contact is made, roll d% to determine
the type of answer you gain.

*True Answer*: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that
cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.

*Don't Know*: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.

*Lie*: The entity intentionally lies to you.

*Random Answer*: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the
answer, so it makes one up.

Contagion

**Contagion**

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The subject contracts one of the following diseases: [blinding
sickness](../glossary.html#_blinding-sickness), [bubonic
plague](../glossary.html#_bubonic-plague), [cackle
fever](../glossary.html#_cackle-fever), [filth

ache](../glossary.html#_red-ache),
[shakes](../glossary.html#_shakes), or [slimy
doom](../glossary.html#_slimy-doom). The disease is contracted
immediately (the onset period does not apply). Use the disease's
listed frequency and save DC to determine further effects. For
more information see [Diseases](../glossary.html#_diseases).

Contingency

**Contingency**

**School** evocation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** at least 10 minutes; see text

**Components** V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a
spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes
into effect under some condition you dictate when casting
*contingency*. The *contingency*spell and the companion spell are
cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum
total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting
time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any
costs associated with the companion spell when you cast
*contingency.*

The spell to be brought into effect by the *contingency*must be
one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher
than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th
level).

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be
clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the
*contingency*immediately brings into effect the companion spell,
the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed
circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are
prescribed, the whole spell combination (*contingency*and the
companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell
occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of
whether you want it to.

You can use only one *contingency*spell at a time; if a second is
cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.

Continual Flame

**Continual Flame**

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard
2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** object touched

**Effect**magical, heatless flame

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from
an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame,
but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A *continual
flame*can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.

Light spells counter and dispel
[darkness](darkness.html#_darkness) spells of an equal or lower
level.

Control Plants

**Control Plants**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to 2 HD/level of plant creatures, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more
plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the
creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what
language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible,
the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell,
the subjects revert to their normal behavior.

Suicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.

Control Undead

**Control Undead**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of bone and a piece of raw meat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to 2 HD/level of undead creatures, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell enables you to control undead creatures for a short
period of time. You command them by voice and they understand
you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal
communication is impossible, the controlled undead do not attack
you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal
behavior.

[Int](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)elligent undead
creatures remember that you controlled them, and they may seek
revenge after the spell's effects end.

Control Water

**Control Water**

**School** transmutation [water]; **Level** cleric 4, druid 4,
sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a pinch of dust for *lower water or*a
drop of water for *raise water*)

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area**water in a volume of 10 ft./level by 10 ft./level by 2
ft./level (S)

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell has two different applications, both of which control
water in different ways. The first version of this spell causes
water in the area to swiftly evaporate or to sink into the ground
below, lowering the water's depth. The second version causes the
water to surge and rise, increasing its overall depth and
possibly flooding nearby areas.

*Lower Water*: This causes water or similar liquid to reduce its
depth by as much as 2 feet per caster level (to a minimum depth
of 1 inch). The water is lowered within a squarish depression
whose sides are up to caster level × 10 feet long. In extremely
large and deep bodies of water, such as a deep ocean, the spell
creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward,
putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal
movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water
elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a
*[slow](slow.html#_slow)*spell ([Will](../combat.html#_will)
negates). The spell has no effect on other creatures.

*Raise Water*: This causes water or similar liquid to rise in
height, just as the *lower water*version causes it to lower.
Boats raised in this way slide down the sides of the hump that
the spell creates. If the area affected by the spell includes
riverbanks, a beach, or other land nearby, the water can spill
over onto dry land.

With either version of this spell, you may reduce one horizontal
dimension by half and double the other horizontal dimension to
change the overall area of effect.

Control Weather

**Control Weather**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 7, druid 7,
sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 10 minutes; see text

**Components** V, S

**Range** 2 miles

**Area** 2-mile-radius circle, centered on you; see text

**Duration** 4d12 hours; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You change the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to
cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to
manifest. You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate
and season of the area you are in. You can also use this spell to
cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the
season.

  Season        Possible Weather
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Spring        Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather
  Summer        Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm
  Autumn        Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet
  Winter        Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw
  Late winter   Hurricane-force winds or early spring

You control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the
direction and intensity of the wind. You cannot control specific
applications of the weather—where lightning strikes, for example,
or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as you left
it for the duration, or until you use a standard action to
designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10
minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible
simultaneously.

*Control weather*can do away with atmospheric phenomena
(naturally occurring or otherwise) as well as create them.

A druid casting this spell doubles the duration and affects a
circle with a 3-mile radius.

Control Winds

**Control Winds**

**School** transmutation [air]; **Level** druid 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 40 ft./level

**Area** 40 ft./level radius cylinder 40 ft. high

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

You alter wind force in the area surrounding you. You can make
the wind blow in a certain direction or manner, increase its
strength, or decrease its strength. The new wind direction and
strength persist until the spell ends or until you choose to
alter your handiwork, which requires concentration. You may
create an “eye” of calm air up to 80 feet in diameter at the
center of the area if you so desire, and you may choose to limit
the area to any cylindrical area less than your full limit.

*Wind Direction*: You may choose one of four basic wind patterns
to function over the spell's area.

-   A downdraft blows from the center outward in equal strength
    in all directions.
-   An updraft blows from the outer edges in toward the center in
    equal strength from all directions, veering upward before
    impinging on the eye in the center.
-   Rotation causes the winds to circle the center in clockwise
    or counterclockwise fashion.
-   A blast simply causes the winds to blow in one direction
    across the entire area from one side to the other.

*Wind Strength*: For every three caster levels, you can increase
or decrease wind strength by one level. Each round on your turn,
a creature in the wind must make a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save or suffer the effect
of being in the windy area. See
[Environment](../environment.html) for more details.

Strong winds (21+ mph) make sailing difficult.

A severe wind (31+ mph) causes minor ship and building damage.

A windstorm (51+ mph) drives most flying creatures from the
skies, uproots small trees, knocks down light wooden structures,
tears off roofs, and endangers ships.

Hurricane force winds (75+ mph) destroy wooden buildings, uproot
large trees, and cause most ships to founder.

A tornado (175+ mph) destroys all nonfortified buildings and
often uproots large trees.

Create Food and Water

**Create Food and Water**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 3

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** food and water to sustain three humans or one
horse/level for 24 hours

**Duration** 24 hours; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your
choice—highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays
and becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept
fresh for another 24 hours by casting a *purify food and
water*spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like
clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.

Create Greater Undead

**Create Greater Undead**

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard
8

This spell functions like *[create
undead](createUndead.html#_create-undead),* except that you can
create more powerful and intelligent sorts of undead: shadows,
wraiths, spectres, and devourers. The type or types of undead
created is based on caster level, as shown below.

  Caster Level     Undead Created
  ---------------- ----------------
  15th or lower    Shadow
  16th–17th        Wraith
  18th–19th        Spectre
  20th or higher   Devourer

Create Undead

**Create Undead**

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard
6

**Casting Time** 1 hour

**Components** V, S, M (a clay pot filled with grave dirt and an
onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one corpse

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

A much more potent spell than *[animate
dead](animateDead.html#_animate-dead),*this evil spell allows you
to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more
powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs.
The type or types of undead you can create are based on your
caster level, as shown on the table below.

  Caster Level     Undead Created
  ---------------- ----------------
  11th or lower    Ghoul
  12th–14th        Ghast
  15th–17th        Mummy
  18th or higher   Mohrg

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow
if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the
control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding
undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it
forms.

This spell must be cast at night.

Create Water

**Create Water**

**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** cleric 0,
druid 0, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** up to 2 gallons of water/level

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean
rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will
actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as
large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small
receptacles. This water disappears after 1 day if not consumed.

*Note*: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects
within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One
cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about
60 pounds.

Creeping Doom

**Creeping Doom**

**School**conjuration (summoning); **Level**druid 7

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)/100 ft.; see text

**Effect**four swarms of insects

**Duration**1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial,
see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

This spell summons four massive swarms of biting and stinging
insects. These swarms appear adjacent to one another, but can be
directed to move independently. Treat these swarms as centipede
swarms with the following adjustments. The swarms have 60 hit
points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm
attack. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects
is equal to the save DC of this spell. Creatures caught in
multiple swarms only take damage and make saves once.

You may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other
creatures. As a standard action, you can command any number of
the swarms to move toward any target within 100 feet of you. You
cannot command any swarm to move more than 100 feet away from
you, and if you move more than 100 feet from any swarm, that
swarm remains stationary, attacking any creatures in its area
(but can be commanded again if you move within 100 feet).

Crushing Despair

**Crushing Despair**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

An invisible cone of despair causes great sadness in the
subjects. Each affected creature takes a –2 penalty on attack
rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon
damage rolls.

*Crushing despair* counters and dispels *[good
hope](goodHope.html#_good-hope)*.

Crushing Hand

**Crushing Hand**

**School**evocation [force]; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions as *[interposing
hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*, except that it
can also grapple one opponent as *[grasping
hand](graspingHand.html#_grasping-hand)*. Its
[CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) and
[CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) for grapple checks
use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a
+12 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)
score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) is 10, granting no
bonus to the [CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense)). A
*crushing hand*deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful
grapple check against an opponent. The *crushing hand* can
instead be directed to bull rush a target (as *[forceful
hand](forcefulHand.html#_forceful-hand)*), using the same bonuses
outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as
*[interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)*
does.

Cure Critical Wounds

**Cure Critical Wounds**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 4, cleric 4,
druid 5

This spell functions like *[cure light
wounds](cureLightWounds.html#_cure-light-wounds)*, except that it
cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+20).

**Cure Critical Wounds, Mass**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 8, druid 9

This spell functions like *mass cure light wounds*, except that
it cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+40).

Cure Light Wounds

**Cure Light Wounds**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 1, cleric 1,
druid 1, paladin 1, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) half (harmless); see
text; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**
yes (harmless); see text

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel
positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per
caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative
energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their
wounds. An undead creature can apply [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance), and can attempt
a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save to take half damage.

**Cure Light Wounds, Mass**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 5, cleric 5,
druid 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than
30 ft. apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) half (harmless) or
[Will](../combat.html#_will) half; see text; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)
or yes; see text

You channel positive energy to cure 1d8 points of damage + 1
point per caster level (maximum +25) on each selected creature.
Like other *cure*spells, *mass cure light wounds*deals damage to
undead in its area rather than curing them. Each affected undead
may attempt a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save for half damage.

Cure Moderate Wounds

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 2, cleric 2,
druid 3, paladin 3, ranger 3

cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+10).

**Cure Moderate Wounds, Mass**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** bard 6, cleric 6,
druid 7

This spell functions like *mass cure light wounds*, except that
it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+30).

Cure Serious Wounds

druid 4, paladin 4, ranger 4

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes
(object)

This spell imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with negative energy,
turning it into unholy water (see
[Equipment](../equipment.html)). Unholy water damages good
outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders.
