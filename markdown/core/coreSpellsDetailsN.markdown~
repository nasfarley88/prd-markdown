**Neutralize Poison**

**School**conjuration (healing); **Level**bard 4, cleric 4, druid
3, paladin 4, ranger 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M/DF (charcoal)

**Range**touch

**Target**creature or object of up to 1 cu. ft./level touched

**Duration**instantaneous or 10 min./level; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)**yes (harmless,
object)

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched.
If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check
(1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the
target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured
creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any
temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse
instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary
ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

This spell can instead neutralize the poison in a poisonous
creature or object for 10 minutes per level, at the caster's
option. If cast on a creature, the creature receives a
[Will](../combat.html#_will) save to negate the effect.

Nightmare

**Nightmare**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [mind-affecting, evil]; **Level**
bard 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S

**Range** unlimited

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific
creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate.

The *nightmare*prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of
damage. The *nightmare*leaves the subject
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) and unable to regain
arcane spells for the next 24 hours.

The difficulty of the save depends on your knowledge the subject
and the physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

\*You must have some sort of connection to a creature of which
you have no knowledge.

*[Dispel evil](dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)*cast on the subject
while you are casting the spell dispels the *nightmare*and causes
you to be [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 10 minutes per
caster level of the *[dispel
evil](dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)*.

If the recipient is awake when the spell begins, you can choose
to cease casting (ending the spell) or to enter a trance until
the recipient goes to sleep, whereupon you become alert again and
complete the casting. If you are disturbed during the trance, you
must succeed on a Concentration check as if you were in the midst
of casting a spell or the spell ends.

If you choose to enter a trance, you are not aware of your
surroundings or the activities around you while in the trance.

You are defenseless, both physically and mentally, while in the
trance. (You always fail [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) and
[Will](../combat.html#_will) saving throws, for example.)

Creatures who don't sleep (such as outsiders) or dream are immune
to this spell.

Nondetection

**Nondetection**

**School** abjuration; **Level** ranger 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 50 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature or object touched

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by
divination spells such as
*[clairaudience/clairvoyance](clairaudienceClairvoyance.html#_clairaudience-clairvoyance),
[locate object](locateObject.html#_locate-object),*and
*detect*spells. *Nondetection*also prevents location by such
magic items as *crystal ball*s. If a divination is attempted
against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination
must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)
against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast
*nondetection*. If you cast *nondetection*on yourself or on an
item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster
level.

If cast on a creature, *nondetection*wards the creature's gear as
well as the creature itself.
