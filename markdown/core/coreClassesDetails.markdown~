# Barbarian

For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the
fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all
these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of
vicious martial techniques, they are not soldiers or professional
warriors—they are the battle possessed, creatures of slaughter
and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know
little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for
them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before
them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their
death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the
endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors
might rise from all walks of life, both civilized and savage,
though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild
places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit
of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

**Role**: Barbarians excel in combat, possessing the martial
prowess and fortitude to take on foes seemingly far superior to
themselves. With rage granting them boldness and daring beyond
that of most other warriors, barbarians charge furiously into
battle and ruin all who would stand in their way.

**Alignment**: Any nonlawful.

**Hit Die**: d12.

  : Table: Barbarian

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A barbarian is proficient with
all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
and
[martial](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower
shields).

**Fast Movement
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A
barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for her race by
+10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor,
light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.
Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because
of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any
other bonuses to the barbarian's land speed.

**Rage [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A
barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity,
granting her additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a
barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 +
her [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution)
modifier. At each level after 1st, she can rage for 2 additional
rounds. Temporary increases to
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), such as
those gained from rage and spells like *[bear's
endurance](../spells/bearSEndurance.html#_bear-s-endurance),* do
not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage
per day. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total
number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8
hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution), as well as
a +2 morale bonus on [Will saves](../combat.html#_will). In
addition, she takes a –2 penalty to [Armor
Class](../combat.html#_armor-class). The increase to
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) grants the
barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the
rage ends and are not lost first like [temporary hit
points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points). While in rage, a
barbarian cannot use any
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-,
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)-, or
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)-based skills
(except [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics),
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly),
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate), and
[Ride](../skills/ride.html#_ride)) or any ability that requires
patience or concentration.

A barbarian can end her rage as a free action and is
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) after rage for a number of
rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A
barbarian cannot enter a new rage while
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) or
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted) but can otherwise enter
rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a
barbarian falls [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious), her
rage immediately ends, placing her in peril of death.

**Rage Powers
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: As a
barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways.
Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains
another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained
after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers
only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian
to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian
cannot select an individual power more than once.

*Animal Fury
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: While
raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack. If used as part of a
full attack action, the bite attack is made at the barbarian's
full base attack bonus –5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points
of damage (assuming the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 points of damage
if Small) plus half the barbarian's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier. A
barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to
maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved
before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any
grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this
round are at a +2 bonus.

*Clear Mind*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: A
barbarian may reroll a failed [Will save](../combat.html#_will).
This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is
attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The
barbarian must take the second result, even if it is worse. A
barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.
This power can only be used once per rage.

*Fearless Rage
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: While
raging, the barbarian is immune to the
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) and
[frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened) conditions. A
barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this rage
power.

*Guarded Stance*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses)
to her [Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) against melee
attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's current
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) modifier
(minimum 1). This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the
barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action
that does not provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity).

*Increased Damage Reduction*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian's [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) increases by 1/—.
This increase is always active while the barbarian is raging. A
barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its
effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before
selecting this rage power.

*Internal Fortitude
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: While
raging, the barbarian is immune to the
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) and
[nauseated](../glossary.html#_nauseated) conditions. A barbarian
must be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.

*Intimidating Glare*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian can make an
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate) check against
one adjacent foe as a move action. If the barbarian successfully
demoralizes her opponent, the foe is
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for
every 5 points by which the barbarian's check exceeds the DC.

*Knockback*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: Once per
round, the barbarian can make a [bull
rush](../combat.html#_bull-rush) attempt against one target in
place of a melee attack. If successful, the target takes damage
equal to the barbarian's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier and is
moved back as normal. The barbarian does not need to move with
the target if successful. This does not provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity).

*Low-Light Vision*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian's senses sharpen and she gains [low-light
vision](../glossary.html#_low-light-vision) while raging.

*Mighty Swing*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian automatically confirms a [critical
hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits). This power is used as an
immediate action once a critical threat has been determined. A
barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this
power. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Moment of Clarity*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian does not gain any benefits or take any of the penalties
from rage for 1 round. Activating this power is a swift action.
This includes the penalty to [Armor
Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) and the restriction on what
actions can be performed. This round still counts against her
total number of rounds of rage per day. This power can only be
used once per rage.

*Night Vision*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian's senses grow incredibly sharp while raging and she
gains [darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision) 60 feet. A
barbarian must have [low-light
vision](../glossary.html#_low-light-vision) as a rage power or a
racial trait to select this rage power.

*No Escape [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*:
The barbarian can move up to double her normal speed as an
immediate action but she can only use this ability when an
adjacent foe uses a [withdraw action](../combat.html#_withdraw)
to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the
enemy that used the [withdraw action](../combat.html#_withdraw).
The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during
this movement. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Powerful Blow
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a +1 bonus on a single damage roll. This bonus
increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained.
This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is
made. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Quick Reflexes
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: While
raging, the barbarian can make one additional [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity) per round.

*Raging Climber
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: When
raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on
all [Climb](../skills/climb.html#_climb) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks).

*Raging Leaper
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: When
raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on
all [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) made to jump. When
making a jump in this way, the barbarian is always considered to
have a running start.

*Raging Swimmer
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: When
raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on
all [Swim](../skills/swim.html#_swim) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks).

*Renewed Vigor*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: As a
standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8 points of damage + her
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) modifier.
For every four levels the barbarian has attained above 4th, this
amount of damage healed increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at
20th level. A barbarian must be at least 4th level before
selecting this power. This power can be used only once per day
and only while raging.

*Rolling Dodge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a +1 [dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses)
to her [Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) against ranged
attacks for a number of rounds equal to the barbarian's current
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) modifier
(minimum 1). This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the
barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action
that does not provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity).

*Roused Anger*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian may enter a rage even if
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued). While raging after using
this ability, the barbarian is immune to the
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) condition. Once this rage
ends, the barbarian is [exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted)
for 10 minutes per round spent raging.

*Scent* *[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*:
The barbarian gains the [scent](../glossary.html#_scent) ability
while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes (see
[Special
Abilities](../glossary.html#_appendix-1-special-abilities) for
rules on the [scent](../glossary.html#_scent) ability).

*Strength Surge*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian adds her barbarian level on one
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) check or [combat
maneuver check](../combat.html#_combat-maneuvers), or to her
[Combat Maneuver
Defense](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) when an
opponent attempts a maneuver against her. This power is used as
an immediate action. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Superstition
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a +2 morale bonus on [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) made to resist spells,
supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. This bonus
increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained.
While raging, the barbarian cannot be a willing target of any
spell and must make [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) to resist all spells, even
those cast by allies.

*Surprise Accuracy*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on one attack roll. This bonus
increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained.
This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is
made. This power can only be used once per rage.

*Swift Foot*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus to her speed. This
increase is always active while the barbarian is raging. A
barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its
effects stack.

*Terrifying Howl*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl as a standard action. All
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) enemies within 30 feet must
make a [Will save](../combat.html#_will) (DC equal to 10 + 1/2
the barbarian's level + the barbarian's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier) or be
[panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) for 1d4+1 rounds. Once an
enemy has made a save versus terrifying howl (successful or not),
it is immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must have
the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power. A
barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.

*Unexpected Strike
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: The
barbarian can make an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity) against a
foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian,
regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke
an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity). This power
can only be used once per rage. A barbarian must be at least 8th
level before selecting this power.

**Uncanny Dodge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 2nd
level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before
her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be
caught [flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed), even if the
attacker is [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible). She still
loses her [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if immobilized. A barbarian
with this ability can still lose her
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if an opponent successfully
uses the feint action against her.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class,
she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below)
instead.

**Trap Sense
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on [Reflex
saves](../combat.html#_reflex) made to avoid traps and a +1
[dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks made by traps.
These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels
thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense
bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 5th
level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This
defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian
by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue
levels than the target has barbarian levels.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another
class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
character.

**Damage Reduction
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 7th
level, a barbarian gains [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). Subtract 1 from
the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from
a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three
barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this
[damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) rises by 1
point. [Damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) can
reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

**Greater Rage
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 11th
level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) increases to
+6 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves](../combat.html#_will)
increases to +3.

**Indomitable Will
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: While in
rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on
[Will saves](../combat.html#_will) to resist enchantment spells.
This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale
bonus on [Will saves](../combat.html#_will) she also receives
during her rage.

**Tireless Rage
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) at the end of her rage.

**Mighty Rage
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 20th
level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) increases to
+8 and the morale bonus on her [Will saves](../combat.html#_will)
increases to +4.

## Ex-Barbarians

A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and
cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. She retains all other
benefits of the class.

Bard

# Bard

Untold wonders and secrets exist for those skillful enough to
discover them. Through cleverness, talent, and magic, these
cunning few unravel the wiles of the world, becoming adept in the
arts of persuasion, manipulation, and inspiration. Typically
masters of one or many forms of artistry, bards possess an
uncanny ability to know more than they should and use what they
learn to keep themselves and their allies ever one step ahead of
danger. Bards are quick-witted and captivating, and their skills
might lead them down many paths, be they gamblers or
jacks-of-all-trades, scholars or performers, leaders or
scoundrels, or even all of the above. For bards, every day brings
its own opportunities, adventures, and challenges, and only by
bucking the odds, knowing the most, and being the best might they
claim the treasures of each.

**Role**: Bards capably confuse and confound their foes while
inspiring their allies to ever-greater daring. While accomplished
with both weapons and magic, the true strength of bards lies
outside melee, where they can support their companions and
undermine their foes without fear of interruptions to their
performances.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the bard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A bard is proficient with all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow,
and whip. Bards are also proficient with light armor and shields
(except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing
light armor and use a shield without incurring the normal arcane
spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard
wearing medium or heavy armor incurs a chance of arcane spell
failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A
multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure
chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

**Spells**: A bard casts arcane spells drawn from the [bard spell
list](../spellLists.html#_bard-spells) presented in [Spell
Lists](../spellLists.html). He can cast any spell he knows
without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a
[verbal component](../magic.html#_components) (song, recitation,
or music). To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a bard's spell is 10
+ the spell level + the bard's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell
allotment is given on [Table: Bard](#table-3-3-bard). In
addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

The bard's selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells
of the bard's choice. At each new bard level, he gains one or
more new spells, as indicated on [Table: Bard Spells
Known](#table-3-4-bard-spells-known). (Unlike spells per day, the
number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score. The
numbers on [Table: Bard Spells
Known](#table-3-4-bard-spells-known) are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that
(8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in
place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard “loses” the
old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must
be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be
at least one level lower than the highest-level bard spell the
bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given
level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the
same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

A bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any
spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his
allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

**Bardic Knowledge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A bard
adds half his class level (minimum 1) to all
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) and may make all
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) untrained.

**Bardic Performance**: A bard is trained to use the
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill to create
magical effects on those around him, including himself if
desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day
equal to 4 + his [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic
performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard
can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he
has mastered, as indicated by his level.

Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be
maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic
performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop
the previous performance and start a new one as a standard
action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends
immediately if the bard is killed,
[paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed),
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned), knocked
[unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious), or otherwise
prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A
bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at
one time.

At 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move
action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can
start a bardic performance as a swift action.

Each bardic performance has audible components, visual
components, or both.

If a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must
be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect,
and such performances are language dependent. A deaf bard has a
20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance
with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt
still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune
to bardic performances with audible components.

If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must
have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any
effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to
use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails
this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual
components.

*Countersong
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 1st
level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on
sound (but not spells that have verbal components). Each round of
the countersong he makes a
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) (keyboard, percussion,
wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet
of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a
sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) check result in place
of its [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) if, after
the [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) is rolled, the
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) check result proves to
be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is
already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or
language-dependent magical attack, it gains another [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against the effect each
round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill check result for
the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don't allow
saves. Countersong relies on audible components.

*Distraction
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 1st
level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects
that depend on sight. Each round of the distraction, he makes a
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) (act, comedy, dance,
or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard
(including the bard himself) that is affected by an [illusion
(pattern)](../magic.html#_pattern) or [illusion
(figment)](../magic.html#_figment) magical attack may use the
bard's [Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) check result in
place of its [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) if,
after the [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) is
rolled, the [Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill
check proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the
distraction is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous
[illusion (pattern)](../magic.html#_pattern) or [illusion
(figment)](../magic.html#_figment) magical attack, it gains
another [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against the
effect each round it sees the distraction, but it must use the
bard's [Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill check
result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that
don't allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.

*Fascinate [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*:
At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more
creatures to become [fascinated](../glossary.html#_fascinated)
with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet,
able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to
him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected.
The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents this
ability from working. For every three levels the bard has
attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with
this ability.

Each creature within range receives a [Will
save](../combat.html#_will) (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the
bard's [Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier) to
negate the effect. If a creature's [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) succeeds, the bard cannot
attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) fails, the creature
sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard
continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a –4
penalty on all [skill checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks)
made as reactions, such as
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) checks. Any
potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against the effect.
Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a
spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the
effect.

Fascinate is an [enchantment
(compulsion)](../magic.html#_compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to
function.

*Inspire Courage
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A 1st-level
bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies
(including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving
their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to
perceive the bard's performance. An affected ally receives a +1
morale bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on
attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard
levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4
at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard
must choose which component to use when starting his performance.

*Inspire Competence
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally
succeed at a task. That ally must be within 30 feet and be able
to hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) with a particular
skill as long as she continues to hear the bard's performance.
This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has
attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at
19th). Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth), and may be disallowed
at the GM's discretion. A bard can't inspire competence in
himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.

*Suggestion [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: A
bard of 6th level or higher can use his performance to make a
*[suggestion](../spells/suggestion.html#_suggestion)* (as per the
spell) to a creature he has already fascinated (see above). Using
this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does
require a standard action to activate (in addition to the free
action to continue the fascinate effect). A bard can use this
ability more than once against an individual creature during an
individual performance.

Making a *suggestion* does not count against a bard's daily use
of bardic performance. A [Will saving
throw](../combat.html#_will) (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the
bard's [Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier)
negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature.
*Suggestion*is an [enchantment
(compulsion)](../magic.html#_compulsion), mind affecting,
language-dependent ability and relies on audible components.

*Dirge of Doom
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
8th level or higher can use his performance to foster a sense of
growing dread in his enemies, causing them to become
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken). To be affected, an enemy must
be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard's
performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is
within 30 feet and the bard continues his performance. This
performance cannot cause a creature to become
[frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened) or
[panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked), even if the targets are
already [shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) from another effect.
Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on
audible and visual components.

*Inspire Greatness
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
9th level or higher can use his performance to inspire greatness
in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting
extra fighting capability. For every three levels the bard
attains beyond 9th, he can target an additional ally while using
this performance (up to a maximum of four targets at 18th level).
To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and
hear the bard. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus
Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of [temporary hit
points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points) (apply the target's
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) modifier, if
any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack
rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on [Fortitude
saves](../combat.html#_fortitude). The bonus Hit Dice count as
regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are
Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability
and it relies on audible and visual components.

*Soothing Performance*
*[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
12th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect
equivalent to a *[mass cure serious
wounds](../spells/cureSeriousWounds.html#_cure-serious-wounds-mass),*using
the bard's level as the caster level. In addition, this
performance removes the [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued),
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened), and
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) conditions from all those
affected. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of continuous
performance, and the targets must be able to see and hear the
bard throughout the performance. Soothing performance affects all
targets that remain within 30 feet throughout the performance.
Soothing performance relies on audible and visual components.

*Frightening Tune
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: A bard of
14th level or higher can use his performance to cause fear in his
enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the bard
perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a
[Will save](../combat.html#_will) (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level +
the bard's [Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier)
to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is
immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the
target becomes [frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened) and
flees for as long as the target can hear the bard's performance.
Frightening tune relies on audible components.

*Inspire Heroics*
*[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in himself or
a single ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the
character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in an
additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must
be able to see and hear the bard. Inspired creatures gain a +4
morale bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
and a +4 [dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). This effect lasts for as long
as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire
heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and
visual components.

*Mass Suggestion
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: This ability
functions just like *suggestion,*but allows a bard of 18th level
or higher to make a *suggestion* simultaneously to any number of
creatures that he has already fascinated. *Mass suggestion* is an
[enchantment (compulsion)](../magic.html#_compulsion),
mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible
components.

*Deadly Performance
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: A bard of
20th level or higher can use his performance to cause one enemy
to die from joy or sorrow. To be affected, the target must be
able to see and hear the bard perform for 1 full round and be
within 30 feet. The target receives a [Will
save](../combat.html#_will) (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the
bard's [Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier) to
negate the effect. If a creature's [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) succeeds, the target is
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) for 1d4 rounds, and the
bard cannot use deadly performance on that creature again for 24
hours. If a creature's [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) fails, it dies. Deadly
performance is a mind-affecting death effect that relies on
audible and visual components.

**Cantrips**: Bards learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, as noted on [Table: Bard Spells
Known](#table-3-4-bard-spells-known) under “Spells Known.” These
spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any
slots and may be used again.

**Versatile Performance
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 2nd
level, a bard can choose one type of
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill. He can use his
bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills.
When substituting in this way, the bard uses his total
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) skill bonus, including
class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill's bonus,
whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is a class
skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the bard can
select an additional type of
[Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) to substitute.

The types of [Perform](../skills/perform.html#_perform) and their
associated skills are: Act ([Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff),
[Disguise](../skills/disguise.html#_disguise)), Comedy
([Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff),
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate)), Dance
([Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics),
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly)), Keyboard Instruments
([Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy),
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate)), Oratory
([Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy), [Sense
Motive](../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive)), Percussion
([Handle Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal),
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate)), Sing
([Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff), [Sense
Motive](../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive)), String
([Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff),
[Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy)), and Wind
([Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy), [Handle
Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal)).

**Well-Versed
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 2nd
level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of
others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4
bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) made
against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent
effects.

**Lore Master
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 5th
level, the bard becomes a master of lore and can take 10 on any
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) skill check that
he has ranks in. A bard can choose not to take 10 and can instead
roll normally. In addition, once per day, the bard can take 20 on
any [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) skill check
as a standard action. He can use this ability one additional time
per day for every six levels he possesses beyond 5th, to a
maximum of three times per day at 17th level.

**Jack-of-All-Trades
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 10th
level, the bard can use any skill, even if the skill normally
requires him to be trained. At 16th level, the bard considers all
skills to be class skills. At 19th level, the bard can take 10 on
any skill check, even if it is not normally allowed.

Cleric

# Cleric

In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater
purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding,
all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of
their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these
emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through
strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the
tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these
ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of
their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities,
clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities
they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others
judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and
corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread
these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms
of the gods themselves.

**Role**: More than capable of upholding the honor of their
deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable
combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw
upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own
and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with
divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need.

As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must
focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority
of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate
themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle,
death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction. (Work
with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific
deity.)

**Alignment**: A cleric's
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) must be within
one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the
good/evil axis (see [Additional Rules](../additionalRules.html)).

**Hit Die**: d8.

## Class Features

The following are class features of the cleric.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Clerics are proficient with all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower
shields). Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of
their deity.

**Aura [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A
cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a
particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) (see the *[detect
evil](../spells/detectEvil.html#_detect-evil)* spell for
details).

**Spells**: A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the
[cleric spell list](../spellLists.html#_cleric-spells) presented
in [Spell Lists](../spellLists.html). Her
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment), however, may
restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or
ethical beliefs; see [chaotic, evil, good, and lawful
spells](#chaotic-evil-good-and-lawful-spells). A cleric must
choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score equal to at least
10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a cleric's spell is
10 + the spell level + the cleric's
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell
allotment is given on [Table: Cleric](#table-3-5-cleric). In
addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score (see [Table:
Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must
choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet
contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of
spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric
spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but
she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily
meditation.

**Channel Energy
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: Regardless
of [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment), any cleric
can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith
through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to
cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled
and the creatures targeted.

A good cleric (or one who worships a good deity) channels
positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures
or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or one who worships
an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal
damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral
cleric who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to
a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or
negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed.
This decision also determines whether the cleric casts
spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see spontaneous casting).

Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of
one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered
on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to
1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two
cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on).
Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a [Will
save](../combat.html#_will) to halve the damage. The DC of this
save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.
Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum
hit point total—all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel
energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. This
is a standard action that does not provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity). A cleric
can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A
cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this
ability.

**Domains**: A cleric's deity influences her
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment), what magic she
can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses
two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can
select an [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) domain
(Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) matches that
domain. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she
still selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations
and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) domains still
applies.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the
level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A
cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell
she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one
of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain
spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it
only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to
cast spells spontaneously.

In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her
domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise
noted, using a domain power is a standard action. Cleric domains
are listed at the end of this class entry.

**Orisons**: Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, each day, as noted on [Table: Cleric](#table-3-5-cleric)
under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other
spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a
good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells
that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can “lose” any
prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to
cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure
spell is any spell with “cure” in its name).

An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity)
can't convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them
to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its
name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither
good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict
spells (player's choice). Once the player makes this choice, it
cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the
cleric channels positive or negative energy (see [Channel
Energy](#channel-energy-cleric)).

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A cleric can't cast
spells of an [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)
opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells
associated with particular alignments are indicated by the
chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell
descriptions.

**Bonus Languages**: A cleric's bonus language options include
Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic
evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are
in addition to the bonus languages available to the character
because of her race.

## Ex-Clerics

A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by her
god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and
shield proficiencies and proficiency with
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons. She cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that
god until she atones for her deeds (see the
*[atonement](../spells/atonement.html#_atonement)* spell
description).

## Domains {#domains-list}

Clerics may select any two of the domains granted by their deity.
Clerics without a deity may select any two domains (choice are
subject to GM approval).

## Air Domain

**Granted Powers**: You can manipulate lightning, mist, and wind,
traffic with air creatures, and are resistant to electricity
damage.

*Lightning Arc
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As a standard
action, you can unleash an arc of electricity targeting any foe
within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This arc of electricity
deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every two
cleric levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

*Electricity Resistance
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 6th
level, you gain resist electricity 10. This resistance increases
to 20 at 12th level. At 20th level, you gain immunity to

*speak with animals*, as per the spell, for a number of rounds
per day equal to 3 + your cleric level.

*Animal Companion

level, you gain the service of an animal companion. Your
effective druid level for this animal companion is equal to your
cleric level – 3. (Druids who take this ability through their
nature bond class feature use their druid level – 3 to determine
the abilities of their animal companions).

**Domain Spells**: 1st—*[calm
animals](../spells/calmAnimals.html#_calm-animals),*2nd—*[hold

*Artificer's Touch
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: You can cast
*mending*at will, using your cleric level as the caster level to
repair damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to
objects and construct creatures by striking them with a melee
touch attack. Objects and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1
for every two cleric levels you possess. This attack bypasses an
amount of [damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)
and hardness equal to your cleric level. You can use this ability
a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: You can imbue
a target with chaos as a melee touch attack. For the next round,
anytime the target rolls a d20, he must roll twice and take the
less favorable result. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

*Chaos Blade
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 8th
level, you can give a weapon touched the*anarchic*special weapon

monster IX](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-ix)*
(chaos spell only).

## Charm Domain

**Granted Powers**: You can baffle and befuddle foes with a touch
or a smile, and your beauty and grace are divine.

*Dazing Touch [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
You can cause a living creature to become
[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed) for 1 round as a melee touch
attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your cleric level are
unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)
modifier.

*Charming Smile
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 8th level,
you can cast *[charm
person](../spells/charmPerson.html#_charm-person)* as a swift
action, with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier. You can only
have one creature charmed in this way at a time. The total number
of rounds of this effect per day is equal to your cleric level.
The rounds do not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss the
charm at any time as a free action. Each attempt to use this
ability consumes 1 round of its duration, whether or not the
creature succeeds on its save to resist the effect.

person](../spells/charmPerson.html#_charm-person),*2nd—*[calm
emotions](../spells/calmEmotions.html#_calm-emotions),*3rd—*[suggestion](../spells/suggestion.html#_suggestion),*4th—*[heroism](../spells/heroism.html#_heroism),*5th—*[charm

monster](../spells/dominateMonster.html#_dominate-monster)*.

## Community Domain

**Granted Powers**: Your touch can heal wounds, and your presence
instills unity and strengthens emotional bonds.

*Calming Touch
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: You can touch
a creature as a standard action to heal it of 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage + 1 point per cleric level. This touch also
removes the [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued),
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken), and
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) conditions (but has no
effect on more severe conditions). You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

*Unity [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At
8th level, whenever a spell or effect targets you and one or more
allies within 30 feet, you can use this ability to allow your
allies to use your [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
against the effect in place of their own. Each ally must decide
individually before the rolls are made. Using this ability is an
immediate action. You can use this ability once per day at 8th
level, and one additional time per day for every four cleric
levels beyond 8th.

defensive thorns, and can communicate with plants.

*Wooden Fist
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: As a free

thorns. While you have wooden fists, your unarmed strikes do not
provoke attacks of opportunity, deal lethal damage, and gain a

striking you with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon without

addition, you receive a +1 resistance bonus on [saving

for every 5 levels you possess.

*Resistant Touch
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As a standard

for 1 minute. When you use this ability, you lose your resistance

sphere](../spells/prismaticSphere.html#_prismatic-sphere)*.

## Repose Domain

**Granted Powers**: You see death not as something to be feared,
but as a final rest and reward for a life well spent. The taint
of undeath is a mockery of what you hold dear.

*Gentle Rest [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
Your touch can fill a creature with lethargy, causing a living
creature to become [staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) for 1
round as a melee touch attack. If you touch a
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) living creature, that
creature falls asleep for 1 round instead. Undead creatures

number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. Living
creatures in this area are immune to all death effects, energy

the negative levels have no effect while the creature is inside
the warded area. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

a bonus feat.

*Blast Rune [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent
square. Any creature entering this square takes 1d6 points of
damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. This
rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage,
decided when you create the rune. The rune is
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) and lasts a number of
rounds equal to your cleric level or until discharged. You cannot
create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature.
This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of
dispelling. It can be discovered with a DC 26
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) skill check
and disarmed with a DC 26 [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) skill
check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

*Spell Rune [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
At 8th level, you can attach another spell that you cast to one
of your blast runes, causing that spell to affect the creature
that triggers the rune, in addition to the damage. This spell
must be of at least one level lower than the highest-level cleric
spell you can cast and it must target one or more creatures.
Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally
affect, it only affects the creature that triggers the rune.

**Domain Spells**:
1st—*[erase](../spells/erase.html#_erase),*2nd—*[secret

## Strength Domain

**Granted Powers**: In strength and brawn there is truth—your
faith gives you incredible might and power.

*Strength Surge
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As a standard
action, you can touch a creature to give it great strength. For 1
round, the target gains an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 your
cleric level (minimum +1) to melee attacks, combat maneuver
checks that rely on [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength),
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)-based skills, and

level, you can add your cleric level as an enhancement bonus to
your [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score for a
number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. This bonus

do not need to be consecutive.

deeds.

*Sun's Blessing
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: Whenever
you channel positive energy to harm undead creatures, add your
cleric level to the damage dealt. Undead do not add their channel
resistance to their saves when you channel positive energy.

*Nimbus of Light
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 8th
level, you can emit a 30-foot nimbus of light for a number of
rounds per day equal to your cleric level. This acts as a
*daylight*spell. In addition, undead within this radius take an
amount of damage equal to your cleric level each round that they
remain inside the nimbus. Spells and spell-like abilities with
the darkness descriptor are automatically dispelled if brought

Druid

# Druid

Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds
lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet
undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of
philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and
manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of
the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten
them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock
themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with
incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting
abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to
call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to
storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long
abandoned and forgotten by civilization.

**Role**: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle,
allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they
confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into
deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship
personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature
itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though
druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic
demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.

**Alignment**: Any neutral.

**Hit Die**: d8.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the druid.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Druids are proficient with the
following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar,
scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also
proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of
any form they assume with wild shape (see below).

Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are
prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only
padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden
armor that has been altered by the *ironwood* spell so that it
functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with
shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted
from wood.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is
unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or
spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours
thereafter.

**Spells**: A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the
druid spell list presented in [Spell Lists](../spellLists.html).
Her [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) may restrict
her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical
beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must
choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score equal to at least
10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a druid's spell is 10
+ the spell level + the druid's
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Druid. In addition, she receives
bonus spells per day if she has a high
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score (see [Table:
Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on
the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells.
A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list,
provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must
choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

**Spontaneous Casting**: A druid can channel stored spell energy
into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She
can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's
ally* spell of the same level or lower.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: A druid can't cast
spells of an [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)
opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells
associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos,
evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

**Orisons**: Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, each day, as noted on Table: Druid under “Spells per
Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are
not expended when cast and may be used again.

**Bonus Languages**: A druid's bonus language options include
Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in
addition to the bonus languages available to the character
because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to
druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic
is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition
to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a
language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to
nondruids.

Druidic has its own alphabet.

**Nature Bond
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 1st
level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one
of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world,
granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: Air,
Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, or Weather. When determining
the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's
effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that
selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots,
just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in
this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell
spontaneously.

The second option is to form a close bond with an animal
companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed
in [Animal Choices](#animal-companions-animal-choices). This
animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her
adventures.

Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit
Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances
in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more
than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the
purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the
companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their
druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a
druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one
by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of
prayer in the environment where the new companion typically
lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that
has perished.

**Nature Sense
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A druid
gains a +2 bonus on
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (nature) and
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) checks.

**Wild Empathy
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A druid
can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions
just like a [Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy)
check made to improve the attitude of a person (see [Using
Skills](../usingSkills.html)). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her
druid level and her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier to
determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic
animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals
are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30
feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally,
influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with
influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast
with an [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.

**Woodland Stride
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth
(such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar
terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or
suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown
areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion,
however, still affect her.

**Trackless Step
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and
cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

**Resist Nature's Lure
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against the spell-like and
supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells
and effects that utilize or target plants, such as
*[blight](../spells/blight.html#_blight),
[entangle](../spells/entangle.html#_entangle), [spike
growth](../spells/spikeGrowth.html#_spike-growth),*and *[warp
wood](../spells/warpWood.html#_warp-wood).*

**Wild Shape
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 4th
level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small
or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new
forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability
functions like the *[beast shape
I](../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-i)* spell, except as
noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until
she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard
action and doesn't provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity). The form
chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is
familiar.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because
she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can
make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the
same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild
parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not
permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th
level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times
at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will.
As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on
the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants.
Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of
the form taken.

At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form
of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as *[beast shape
II](../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-ii)*. When taking the
form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as
*[elemental body
I](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-i)*.

At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or
Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's
wild shape now functions as *[beast shape
III](../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-iii)*. When taking
the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as
*[elemental body
II](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-ii)*. When
taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape
functions as *[plant shape
I](../spells/plantShape.html#_plant-shape-i)*.

At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form
of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as
*[elemental body
III](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-iii)*. When
taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions
as *[plant shape II](../spells/plantShape.html#_plant-shape-ii)*.

At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a
Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of
an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as *[elemental
body IV](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-iv)*. When
taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions
as *[plant shape
III](../spells/plantShape.html#_plant-shape-iii)*.

**Venom Immunity
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 9th
level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

**A Thousand Faces
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 13th
level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at
will, as if using the *[alter
self](../spells/alterSelf.html#_alter-self)* spell, but only
while in her normal form.

**Timeless Body
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: After
attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score
penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties
she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses
still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time
is up.

## Ex-Druids

A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment), or teaches the
Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid
abilities (including her animal companion, but not including
weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter
gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the
*[atonement](../spells/atonement.html#_atonement)* spell
description).

## Animal Companions {#animal-companions-184}

An animal companion's abilities are determined by the druid's
level and its animal racial traits. Table: Animal Companion Base
Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the animal
companion. They remain creatures of the animal type for purposes
of determining which spells can affect them.

  : Table: Animal Companion Base Statistics

**Class Level**: This is the character's druid level. The druid's
class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are
entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining
the companion's statistics.

**HD**: This is the total number of eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice the
animal companion possesses, each of which gains a
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) modifier, as
normal.

**BAB**: This is the animal companion's base attack bonus. An
animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a
druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. Animal companions do
not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a
high base attack bonus.

**Fort/[Ref](../combat.html#_reflex)/Will**: These are the animal
companion's base [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
bonuses. An animal companion has good
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) and [Reflex
saves](../combat.html#_reflex).

**Skills**: This lists the animal's total skill ranks. Animal
companions can assign skill ranks to any skill listed under
Animal Skills. If an animal companion increases its
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) to 10 or
higher, it gains bonus skill ranks as normal. Animal companions
with an [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of 3
or higher can purchase ranks in any skill. An animal companion
cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.

**Feats**: This is the total number of feats possessed by an
animal companion. Animal companions should select their feats
from those listed under Animal Feats. Animal companions can
select other feats, although they are unable to utilize some
feats (such as Martial Weapon Proficiency). Note that animal
companions cannot select a feat with a requirement of base attack
bonus +1 until they gain their second feat at 3 Hit Dice.

**Natural Armor Bonus**: The number noted here is an improvement
to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.

**Str/Dex Bonus**: Add this modifier to the animal companion's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) scores.

**Bonus Tricks**: The value given in this column is the total
number of “bonus” tricks that the animal knows in addition to any
that the druid might choose to teach it (see the [Handle
Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal) skill for
more details on how to teach an animal tricks). These bonus
tricks don't require any training time or [Handle
Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal) checks, and
they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the
animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected,
they can't be changed.

**Special**: This includes a number of abilities gained by animal
companions as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is
described below.

*Link [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):* A
druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push
it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the
[Handle Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal)
skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild
empathy checks and [Handle
Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal) checks made
regarding an animal companion.

*Share Spells
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):* The druid
may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion
(as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A druid
may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells
normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type
(animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that
grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the
animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they
function like spells.

*Evasion [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):*
If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally
allows a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage,
it takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws).

*Ability Score Increase
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):* The animal
companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.

*Devotion [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):*
An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on [Will
saves](../combat.html#_will) against enchantment spells and
effects.

*Multiattack:*An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus
feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already
have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more
natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second
attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty.

*Improved Evasion
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex):* When
subjected to an attack that allows a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) for half damage, an animal
companion takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) and only half damage if the
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) fails.

## Animal Skills {#animal-companions-animal-skills}

Animal companions can have ranks in any of the following skills:
[Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics)\*
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Climb](../skills/climb.html#_climb)\*
([Str](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)), [Escape
Artist](../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist)
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly)\*
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate)
([Cha](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)),
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception)\*
([Wis](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)),
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth)\*
([Dex](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)),
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival)
([Wis](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)), and
[Swim](../skills/swim.html#_swim)\*
([Str](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)). All of the skills
marked with an (\*) are class skills for animal companions.
Animal companions with an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of 3 or
higher can put ranks into any skill.

## Animal Feats {#animal-companions-animal-feats}

Animal companions can select from the following feats:
[Acrobatic](../feats.html#_acrobatic), [Agile
Maneuvers](../feats.html#_agile-maneuvers), [Armor
Proficiency](../feats.html#_armor-proficiency-light) (light,
medium, and heavy), [Athletic](../feats.html#_athletic),
[Blind-Fight](../feats.html#_blind-fight), [Combat

## Animal Choices {#animal-companions-animal-choices}

Each animal companion has different starting sizes, speed,
attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All animal
attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus
unless otherwise noted. Animal attacks add the animal's
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier to the
damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds
1-1/2 its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier.
Some have special abilities, such as
[scent](../glossary.html#_scent). See [Special
Abilities](../glossary.html#_appendix-1-special-abilities) for
more information on these abilities. As you gain levels, your
animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or 7th level,
in addition to the standard bonuses noted on Table: Animal
Companion Base Statistics. Instead of taking the listed benefit
at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the
companion's [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) and
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) by 2.

Fighter

# Fighter

Some take up arms for glory, wealth, or revenge. Others do battle
to prove themselves, to protect others, or because they know
nothing else. Still others learn the ways of weaponcraft to hone
their bodies in battle and prove their mettle in the forge of
war. Lords of the battlefield, fighters are a disparate lot,
training with many weapons or just one, perfecting the uses of
armor, learning the fighting techniques of exotic masters, and
studying the art of combat, all to shape themselves into living
weapons. Far more than mere thugs, these skilled warriors reveal
the true deadliness of their weapons, turning hunks of metal into
arms capable of taming kingdoms, slaughtering monsters, and
rousing the hearts of armies. Soldiers, knights, hunters, and
artists of war, fighters are unparalleled champions, and woe to
those who dare stand against them.

**Role**: Fighters excel at combat—defeating their enemies,
controlling the flow of battle, and surviving such sorties
themselves. While their specific weapons and methods grant them a
wide variety of tactics, few can match fighters for sheer battle
prowess.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

  : Table: Fighter

## Class Features

The following are class features of the fighter.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A fighter is proficient with
all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
and
[martial](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields
(including tower shields).

**Bonus Feats**: At 1st level, and at every even level
thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those
gained from normal advancement (meaning that the fighter gains a
feat at every level). These bonus feats must be selected from
those listed as [combat feats](../feats.html#_combat-feats),
sometimes also called “fighter bonus feats.”

Upon reaching 4th level, and every four levels thereafter (8th,
12th, and so on), a fighter can choose to learn a new bonus feat
in place of a bonus feat he has already learned. In effect, the
fighter loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. The old
feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another
feat, prestige class, or other ability. A fighter can only change
one feat at any given level and must choose whether or not to
swap the feat at the time he gains a new bonus feat for the
level.

**Bravery [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**:
Starting at 2nd level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on [Will
saves](../combat.html#_will) against fear. This bonus increases
by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd.

**Armor Training
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while
wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor
check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus allowed by
his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and
15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4
reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the
maximum [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus
allowed.

In addition, a fighter can also move at his normal speed while
wearing medium armor. At 7th level, a fighter can move at his
normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

**Weapon Training
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 5th level, a fighter can select one group of weapons, as noted
below. Whenever he attacks with a weapon from this group, he
gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), a fighter
becomes further trained in another group of weapons. He gains a
+1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when using a weapon from this
group. In addition, the bonuses granted by previous weapon groups
increase by +1 each. For example, when a fighter reaches 9th
level, he receives a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with one
weapon group and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with the
weapon group selected at 5th level. Bonuses granted from
overlapping groups do not stack. Take the highest bonus granted
for a weapon if it resides in two or more groups.

A fighter also adds this bonus to any [combat maneuver
checks](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) made with weapons
from this group. This bonus also applies to the fighter's [Combat
Maneuver Defense](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) when
defending against [disarm](../combat.html#_disarm) and
[sunder](../combat.html#_sunder) attempts made against weapons
from this group.

Weapon groups are defined as follows (GMs may add other weapons
to these groups, or add entirely new groups):

*Axes*: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, heavy pick,
light pick, orc double axe, and throwing axe.

*Blades, Heavy*: bastard sword, elven curve blade, falchion,
greatsword, longsword, scimitar, scythe, and two-bladed sword.

*Blades, Light*: dagger, kama, kukri, rapier, sickle, starknife,
and short sword.

*Bows*: composite longbow, composite shortbow, longbow, and
shortbow.

*Close*: gauntlet, heavy shield, light shield, punching dagger,
sap, spiked armor, spiked gauntlet, spiked shield, and unarmed
strike.

*Crossbows*: hand crossbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, heavy
repeating crossbow, and light repeating crossbow.

*Double*: dire flail, dwarven urgrosh, gnome hooked hammer, orc
double axe, quarterstaff, and two-bladed sword.

*Flails*: dire flail, flail, heavy flail, morningstar, nunchaku,
spiked chain, and whip.

*Hammers*: club, greatclub, heavy mace, light hammer, light mace,
and warhammer.

*Monk*: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham,
and unarmed strike.

*Natural*: unarmed strike and all natural weapons, such as bite,
claw, gore, tail, and wing.

*Pole Arms*: glaive, guisarme, halberd, and ranseur.

*Spears*: javelin, lance, longspear, shortspear, spear, and
trident.

*Thrown*: blowgun, bolas, club, dagger, dart, halfling sling
staff, javelin, light hammer, net, shortspear, shuriken, sling,
spear, starknife, throwing axe, and trident.

**Armor Mastery
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 19th
level, a fighter gains [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)
5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

**Weapon Mastery
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 20th
level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword,
greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks made with that weapon
automatically confirm all critical threats and have their damage
multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In
addition, he cannot be disarmed while wielding a weapon of this
type.

Monk

# Monk

For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the
battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These
warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and
shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of
crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since
they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial
disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from
battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the
path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path
discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are
meant to be.

**Role**: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting
perils, striking where it's least expected, and taking advantage
of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat,
monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies
wherever they are needed most.

**Alignment**: Any lawful.

**Hit Die**: d8.

  : Table: Monk

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monk.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Monks are proficient with the
club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama,
nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shortspear, short sword, shuriken,
siangham, sling, and spear.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.

When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy
load, a monk loses his [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) bonus,
as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

**AC Bonus
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: When
unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) bonus (if any) to his
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and his
[CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense). In addition, a
monk gains a +1 bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) and
[CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) at 4th level. This
bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to
a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

These bonuses to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) apply even
against touch attacks or when the monk is
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed). He loses these
bonuses when he is immobilized or
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless), when he wears any armor,
when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy
load.

**Flurry of Blows
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack
action. When doing so he may make one additional attack using any
combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with a special monk
weapon (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and
siangham) as if using the [Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_two-weapon-fighting) feat (even if the
monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat). For the
purpose of these attacks, the monk's base attack bonus from his
monk class levels is equal to his monk level. For all other
purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, the
monk uses his normal base attack bonus.

At 8th level, the monk can make two additional attacks when he
uses flurry of blows, as if using [Improved Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_improved-two-weapon-fighting) (even if
the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

At 15th level, the monk can make three additional attacks using
flurry of blows, as if using [Greater Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_greater-two-weapon-fighting) (even if
the monk does not meet the prerequisites for the feat).

A monk applies his full
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) bonus to his damage
rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows,
whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon
wielded in both hands. A monk may substitute disarm, sunder, and
trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of
blows. A monk cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike
or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. A monk
with natural weapons cannot use such weapons as part of a flurry
of blows, nor can he make natural attacks in addition to his
flurry of blows attacks.

**Unarmed Strike**: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed
Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with fist,
elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed
strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an
off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus
apply his full [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) bonus
on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.

Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can
choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his
attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal
damage while grappling.

A monk's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon
and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that
enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural
weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a
normal person would, as shown above on Table: Monk. The unarmed
damage values listed on Table: Monk is for Medium monks. A Small
monk deals less damage than the amount given there with his
unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Small
or Large Monk Unarmed Damage on the table given below.

  Level       Damage (Small Monk)   Damage (Large Monk)
  ----------- --------------------- ---------------------
  1st–3rd     1d4                   1d8

  : Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage

**Bonus Feat:** At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels
thereafter, a monk may select a bonus feat. These feats must be
taken from the following list: [Catch
Off-Guard](../feats.html#_catch-off-guard), [Combat
Reflexes](../feats.html#_combat-reflexes), [Deflect
Arrows](../feats.html#_deflect-arrows),
[Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge), [Improved
Grapple](../feats.html#_improved-grapple), [Scorpion
Style](../feats.html#_scorpion-style), and [Throw
Anything](../feats.html#_throw-anything). At 6th level, the
following feats are added to the list: [Gorgon's
Fist](../feats.html#_gorgon-s-fist), [Improved Bull
Rush](../feats.html#_improved-bull-rush), [Improved
Disarm](../feats.html#_improved-disarm), [Improved
Feint](../feats.html#_improved-feint), [Improved
Trip](../feats.html#_improved-trip), and
[Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility). At 10th level, the following
feats are added to the list: [Improved
Critical](../feats.html#_improved-critical), [Medusa's
Wrath](../feats.html#_medusa-s-wrath), [Snatch
Arrows](../feats.html#_snatch-arrows), and [Spring
Attack](../feats.html#_spring-attack). A monk need not have any
of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select
them.

**Stunning Fist
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 1st
level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he
does not meet the prerequisites. At 4th level, and every 4 levels
thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition
to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces
stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) still negates the effect.
At 4th level, he can choose to make the target
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued). At 8th level, he can make
the target [sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) for 1 minute.
At 12th level, he can make the target
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered) for 1d6+1 rounds. At
16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At
20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk
must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is
made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) by Stunning Fist cannot
become [nauseated](../glossary.html#_nauseated) if hit by
Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the
duration.

**Evasion [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**:
At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many
area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against an attack that
normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes
no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light
armor or no armor. A [helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) monk
does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Fast Movement
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as
shown on Table: Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or
heavy load loses this extra speed.

**Maneuver Training
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a monk uses his monk level in place of his base attack
bonus when calculating his [Combat Maneuver
Bonus](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus). Base attack
bonuses granted from other classes are unaffected and are added
normally.

**Still Mind
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A monk of
3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against enchantment spells
and effects.

***Ki* Pool
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 4th
level, a monk gains a pool of *ki*points, supernatural energy he
can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a
monk's *ki* pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier. As long as he
has at least 1 point in his *ki* pool, he can make a *ki* strike.
At 4th level, *ki* strike allows his unarmed attacks to be
treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). *Ki* strike
improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, his
unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the
purpose of overcoming [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). At 16th level,
his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the
purpose of overcoming [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) and bypassing
hardness.

By spending 1 point from his *ki* pool, a monk can make one
additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a
flurry of blows attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to
increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a monk can
spend 1 point from his *ki* pool to give himself a +4 [dodge
bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) for 1 round. Each of these
powers is activated as a swift action. A monk gains additional
powers that consume points from his *ki* pool as he gains levels.

The *ki* pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest
or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.

**Slow Fall
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 4th
level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it
to slow his descent. When first gaining this ability, he takes
damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.
The monk's ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the
effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with
his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to
slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.

**High Jump
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 5th
level, a monk adds his level to all
[Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) checks made
to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In
addition, he always counts as having a running start when making
jump checks using
[Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics). By spending
1 point from his *ki* pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20
bonus on [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics)
checks made to jump for 1 round.

**Purity of Body
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 5th
level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including
supernatural and magical diseases.

**Wholeness of Body
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 7th
level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a standard
action. He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his
monk level by using 2 points from his *ki* pool.

**Improved Evasion
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 9th
level, a monk's evasion ability improves. He still takes no
damage on a successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against attacks, but
henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) monk does not gain the
benefit of improved evasion.

**Diamond Body
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 11th
level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.

**Abundant Step
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 12th
level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if
using the spell *[dimension
door](../spells/dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door)*. Using this
ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from his *ki*
pool. His caster level for this effect is equal to his monk
level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this
ability.

**Diamond Soul
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 13th
level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk
level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a
spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 +
caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.

**Quivering Palm
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: Starting
at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of
another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so
desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and
he must announce his intent before making his attack roll.
Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise,
if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from
the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the
monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the
attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level.
To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die
(a free action), and unless the target makes a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's
level + the monk's [Wis](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom)
modifier), it dies. If the [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) is successful, the target
is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm
attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later
time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at
one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in
effect, the previous effect is negated.

**Timeless Body
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 17th
level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for
aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he
has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still
accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.

**Tongue of the Sun and Moon
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A monk of
17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.

**Empty Body
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 19th
level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1
minute as though using the spell
*[etherealness](../spells/etherealness.html#_etherealness).*
Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from
his *ki* pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be
used to make other creatures ethereal.

**Perfect Self**: At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical
creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as
a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the
purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk
gains [damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)
10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of
damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any
natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar
[damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). Unlike
other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead
as if he were a member of his previous creature type.

## Ex-Monks

A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but
retains all monk abilities.

Paladin

# Paladin

Through a select, worthy few shines the power of the divine.
Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and
lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and
law-bringers, paladins seek not just to spread divine justice but
to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In
pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of
morality and discipline. As reward for their righteousness, these
holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their
quests: powers to banish evil, heal the innocent, and inspire the
faithful. Although their convictions might lead them into
conflict with the very souls they would save, paladins weather
endless challenges of faith and dark temptations, risking their
lives to do right and fighting to bring about a brighter future.

**Role**: Paladins serve as beacons for their allies within the
chaos of battle. While deadly opponents of evil, they can also
empower goodly souls to aid in their crusades. Their magic and
martial skills also make them well suited to defending others and
blessing the fallen with the strength to continue fighting.

**Alignment**: Lawful good.

**Hit Die**: d10.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the paladin.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Paladins are proficient with
all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
and
[martial](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and
with shields (except tower shields).

**Aura of Good
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: The power
of a paladin's aura of good (see the *[detect
good](../spells/detectGood.html#_detect-good)* spell) is equal to
her paladin level.

**Detect Evil**
**[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)**: At will, a
paladin can use *[detect
evil](../spells/detectEvil.html#_detect-evil),* as the spell. A
paladin can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or
individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning
the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds.
While focusing on one individual or object, the paladin does not
detect evil in any other object or individual within range.

**Smite Evil
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: Once per
day, a paladin can call out to the powers of good to aid her in
her struggle against evil. As a swift action, the paladin chooses
one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the
paladin adds her [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her paladin level to
all damage rolls made against the target of her smite. If the
target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an
evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage
on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage
per level the paladin possesses. Regardless of the target, smite
evil attacks automatically bypass any
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the creature might
possess.

In addition, while smite evil is in effect, the paladin gains a
deflection bonus equal to her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier (if
any) to her [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks
made by the target of the smite. If the paladin targets a
creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect.

The smite evil effect remains until the target of the smite is
dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses of
this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter,
the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as
indicated on Table: Paladin, to a maximum of seven times per day
at 19th level.

**Divine Grace
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 2nd
level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) bonus (if any)
on all [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws).

**Lay On Hands
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: Beginning
at 2nd level, a paladin can heal wounds (her own or those of
others) by touch. Each day she can use this ability a number of
times equal to 1/2 her paladin level plus her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. With
one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of
damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Using this
ability is a standard action, unless the paladin targets herself,
in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this
ability, a paladin only needs one free hand to use this ability.

Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal
damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for
every two levels the paladin possesses. Using lay on hands in
this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't
provoke an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity). Undead do
not receive a [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
against this damage.

**Aura of Courage
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 3rd
level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each
ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against fear effects. This
ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she
is [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious) or dead.

**Divine Health
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a paladin is immune to all diseases, including
supernatural and magical diseases, including mummy rot.

**Mercy [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At
3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin can
select one mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin's lay
on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal
damage to one target, the target also receives the additional
effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin. A mercy
can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison
without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1
hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes
the condition.

At 3rd level, the paladin can select from the following initial
mercies.

*• Fatigued*: The target is no longer
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued).

*• Shaken*: The target is no longer
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken).

*• Sickened*: The target is no longer
[sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened).

At 6th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Dazed*: The target is no longer
[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed).

*• Diseased*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*remove disease*, using the paladin's level as the caster level.

*• Staggered*: The target is no longer
[staggered](../glossary.html#_staggered), unless the target is at
exactly 0 hit points.

At 9th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list of
those that can be selected.

*• Cursed*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*[remove curse](../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse),* using
the paladin's level as the caster level.

*• Exhausted*: The target is no longer
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted). The paladin must have
the fatigue mercy before selecting this mercy.

*• Frightened*: The target is no longer
[frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened). The paladin must have
the [shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) mercy before selecting
this mercy.

*• Nauseated*: The target is no longer
[nauseated](../glossary.html#_nauseated). The paladin must have
the [sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) mercy before selecting
this mercy.

*• Poisoned*: The paladin's lay on hands ability also acts as
*neutralize poison*, using the paladin's level as the caster
level.

At 12th level, a paladin adds the following mercies to the list
of those that can be selected.

*• Blinded*: The target is no longer
[blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded).

*• Deafened*: The target is no longer
[deafened](../glossary.html#_deafened).

*• Paralyzed*: The target is no longer
[paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed).

*• Stunned*: The target is no longer
[stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned).

These abilities are cumulative. For example, a 12th-level
paladin's lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and
might also cure [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) and
[exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted) conditions as well as
removing diseases and neutralizing poisons*.*Once a condition or
spell effect is chosen, it can't be changed.

**Channel Positive Energy
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: When a
paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to
channel positive energy like a cleric. Using this ability
consumes two uses of her lay on hands ability. A paladin uses her
level as her effective cleric level when channeling positive
energy. This is a
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based ability.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability
to cast a small number of divine spells which are drawn from the
paladin spell list presented in [Spell
Lists](../spellLists.html). A paladin must choose and prepare her
spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a paladin's spell is
10 + the spell level + the paladin's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Paladin. In addition, she receives
bonus spells per day if she has a high
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).
When Table: Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per
day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she
would be entitled to based on her
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score for that
spell level.

A paladin must spend 1 hour each day in quiet prayer and
meditation to regain her daily allotment of spells. A paladin may
prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided
that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which
spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level
and higher, her caster level is equal to her paladin level – 3.

**Divine Bond
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)**: Upon
reaching 5th level, a paladin forms a divine bond with her god.
This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it
cannot be changed.

The first type of bond allows the paladin to enhance her weapon
as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a celestial
spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit
causes the weapon to shed light as a torch. At 5th level, this
spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three
levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus,
to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to
the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of
+5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon
properties:
*[axiomatic](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-axiomatic)*,
*[brilliant
energy](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-brilliant-energy),
[defending](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-defending),
[disruption](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-disruption),
[flaming](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming), [flaming
burst](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst),
[holy](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-holy),
[keen](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-keen),
[merciful](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-merciful)*, and
*[speed](../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-speed)*. Adding
these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the
property's cost (see Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities).
These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has,
but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not
magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any
other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted
by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot
be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial spirit
imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the
paladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the paladin.
These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. A paladin
can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one
additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a
total of four times per day at 17th level.

If a weapon bonded with a celestial spirit is destroyed, the
paladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until she
gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period,
the paladin takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The second type of bond allows a paladin to gain the service of
an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in
her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy horse
(for a Medium paladin) or a pony (for a Small paladin), although
more exotic mounts, such as a boar, camel, or dog are also
suitable. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion,
using the paladin's level as her effective druid level. Bonded
mounts have an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of at least
6.

Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically
call her mount to her side. This ability is the equivalent of a
spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The
mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin. A paladin can
use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional
time per day for every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four
times per day at 17th level.

At 11th level, the mount gains the celestial template and becomes
a magical beast for the purposes of determining which spells
affect it. At 15th level, a paladin's mount gains spell
resistance equal to the paladin's level + 11.

Should the paladin's mount die, the paladin may not summon
another mount for 30 days or until she gains a paladin level,
whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the paladin
takes a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

**Aura of Resolve
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 8th
level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like
abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale
bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against
charm effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious) or dead.

**Aura of Justice
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 11th
level, a paladin can expend two uses of her smite evil ability to
grant the ability to smite evil to all allies within 10 feet,
using her bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the
start of the paladin's next turn and the bonuses last for 1
minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain
no benefit from this ability.

**Aura of Faith
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 14th
level, a paladin's weapons are treated as good-aligned for the
purposes of overcoming [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). Any attack made
against an enemy within 10 feet of her is treated as good-aligned
for the purposes of overcoming [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction).

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious) or dead.

**Aura of Righteousness
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 17th
level, a paladin gains [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)
5/evil and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like
abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale
bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against
compulsion effects.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not
if she is [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious) or dead.

**Holy Champion
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)**: At 20th
level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) increases to 10/evil.
Whenever she uses smite evil and successfully strikes an evil
outsider, the outsider is also subject to a
*[banishment](../spells/banishment.html#_banishment),* using her
paladin level as the caster level (her weapon and holy symbol
automatically count as objects that the subject hates). After the
*[banishment](../spells/banishment.html#_banishment)* effect and
the damage from the attack is resolved, the smite immediately
ends. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses
lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible
amount.

**Code of Conduct**: A paladin must be of lawful good
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment) and loses all
class features except proficiencies if she ever willingly commits
an evil act.

Additionally, a paladin's code requires that she respect
legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating,
not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided
they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish
those who harm or threaten innocents.

**Associates**: While she may adventure with good or neutral
allies, a paladin avoids working with evil characters or with
anyone who consistently offends her moral code. Under exceptional
circumstances, a paladin can ally with evil associates, but only
to defeat what she believes to be a greater evil. A paladin
should seek an *[atonement](../spells/atonement.html#_atonement)*
spell periodically during such an unusual alliance, and should
end the alliance immediately should she feel it is doing more
harm than good. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or
cohorts who are lawful good.

## Ex-Paladins

A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an
evil act, or who violates the code of conduct loses all paladin
spells and class features (including the service of the paladin's
mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may
not progress any further in levels as a paladin. She regains her
abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her
violations (see the
*[atonement](../spells/atonement.html#_atonement)* spell
description in [Spell Lists](../spellLists.html)), as
appropriate.

Ranger

# Ranger

For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only
predators and prey. Be they scouts, trackers, or bounty hunters,
rangers share much in common: unique mastery of specialized
weapons, skill at stalking even the most elusive game, and the
expertise to defeat a wide range of quarries. Knowledgeable,
patient, and skilled hunters, these rangers hound man, beast, and
monster alike, gaining insight into the way of the predator,
skill in varied environments, and ever more lethal martial
prowess. While some track man-eating creatures to protect the
frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives among
their own people.

**Role**: Rangers are deft skirmishers, either in melee or at
range, capable of skillfully dancing in and out of battle. Their
abilities allow them to deal significant harm to specific types
of foes, but their skills are valuable against all manner of
enemies.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d10.

  : Ranger Favored Enemies

**Favored Enemy
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 1st
level, a ranger selects a creature type from the ranger favored
enemies table. He gains a +2 bonus on
[Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff),
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge),
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception), [Sense
Motive](../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive), and
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) checks against
creatures of his selected type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on
weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A ranger may make
[Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) untrained when
attempting to identify these creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and
20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy.
In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one
favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired)
increases by +2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy,
he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the
table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to
choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are
merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more
than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not
stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

**Track [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A
ranger adds half his level (minimum 1) to
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) made to follow or
identify tracks.

**Wild Empathy
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A ranger
can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability
functions just like a
[Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy) check to improve
the attitude of a person (see [Using
Skills](../usingSkills.html)). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his
ranger level and his
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) bonus to
determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic
animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals
are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be within 30
feet of one another under normal visibility conditions.
Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but,
as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast
with an [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
score of 1 or 2, but he takes a –4 penalty on the check.

**Combat Style Feat
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 2nd
level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue:
archery or two-weapon combat. The ranger's expertise manifests in
the form of bonus feats at 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.
He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he
does not have the normal prerequisites.

If the ranger selects archery, he can choose from the following
list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Far
Shot](../feats.html#_far-shot), [Point Blank
Shot](../feats.html#_point-blank-shot), [Precise
Shot](../feats.html#_precise-shot), and [Rapid
Shot](../feats.html#_rapid-shot). At 6th level, he adds [Improved
Precise Shot](../feats.html#_improved-precise-shot) and
[Manyshot](../feats.html#_manyshot) to the list. At 10th level,
he adds [Pinpoint Targeting](../feats.html#_pinpoint-targeting)
and [Shot on the Run](../feats.html#_shot-on-the-run) to the
list.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he can choose from the
following list whenever he gains a combat style feat: [Double
Slice](../feats.html#_double-slice), [Improved Shield
Bash](../feats.html#_improved-shield-bash), [Quick
Draw](../feats.html#_quick-draw), and [Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_two-weapon-fighting). At 6th level, he
adds [Improved Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_improved-two-weapon-fighting) and
[Two-Weapon Defense](../feats.html#_two-weapon-defense) to the
list. At 10th level, he adds [Greater Two-Weapon
Fighting](../feats.html#_greater-two-weapon-fighting) and
[Two-Weapon Rend](../feats.html#_two-weapon-rend) to the list.

The benefits of the ranger's chosen style feats apply only when
he wears light, medium, or no armor. He loses all benefits of his
combat style feats when wearing heavy armor. Once a ranger
selects a combat style, it cannot be changed.

**Endurance**: A ranger gains
[Endurance](../feats.html#_endurance) as a bonus feat at 3rd
level.

  ----------------------------------------------
  Cold (ice, glaciers, snow, and tundra)
  Desert (sand and wastelands)
  Forest (coniferous and deciduous)
  Jungle
  Mountain (including hills)
  Plains
  Planes (pick one, other than Material Plane)
  Swamp
  Underground (caves and dungeons)
  Urban (buildings, streets, and sewers)
  Water (above and below the surface)
  ----------------------------------------------

  : Favored Terrains

**Favored Terrain
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a ranger may select a type of terrain from the Favored
Terrains table. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks
and [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (geography),
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception),
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth), and
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) when he is in this
terrain. A ranger traveling through his favored terrain normally
leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though he may leave a
trail if he so chooses).

At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the ranger may
select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such
interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored
terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired),
increases by +2.

If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of
favored terrain, the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply
uses whichever bonus is higher.

**Hunter's Bond
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 4th
level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This
bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it
cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This
bond allows him to spend a move action to grant half his favored
enemy bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to
all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus
lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier (minimum 1).
This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses
possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.

The second option is to form a close bond with an [animal
companion](druid.html#_animal-companions-184). A ranger who
selects an animal companion can choose from the following list:
badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, dog, horse, pony,
snake (viper or constrictor), or wolf. If the campaign takes
place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may
choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that
accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its
kind. A ranger's animal companion shares his favored enemy and
favored terrain bonuses.

This ability functions like the druid animal companion ability
(which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the
ranger's effective druid level is equal to his ranger level – 3.

**Spells**: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to
cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the
ranger spell list presented in [Spell Lists](../spellLists.html).
A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score equal to at least
10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a ranger's spell is
10 + the spell level + the ranger's
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number
of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell
allotment is given on Table: Ranger. In addition, he receives
bonus spells per day if he has a high
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score (see [Table:
Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).
When Table: Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per
day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he
would be entitled to based on his
[Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) score for that spell
level.

A ranger must spend 1 hour per day in quiet meditation to regain
his daily allotment of spells. A ranger may prepare and cast any
spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells
of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during
his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and
higher, his caster level is equal to his ranger level – 3.

**Woodland Stride
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth
(such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar
terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or
suffering any other impairment.

Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or
magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect
him.

**Swift Tracker
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Beginning
at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while using
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) to follow tracks
without taking the normal –5 penalty. He takes only a –10 penalty
(instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal
speed while tracking.

**Evasion [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**:
When he reaches 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and
unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against an attack that
normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes
no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing
light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) ranger does not gain the
benefit of evasion.

**Quarry [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**:
At 11th level, a ranger can, as a standard action, denote one
target within his line of sight as his quarry. Whenever he is
following the tracks of his quarry, a ranger can take 10 on his
[Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) while moving at normal
speed, without penalty. In addition, he receives a +2 insight
bonus on attack rolls made against his quarry, and all critical
threats are automatically confirmed. A ranger can have no more
than one quarry at a time and the creature's type must correspond
to one of his favored enemy types. He can dismiss this effect at
any time as a free action, but he cannot select a new quarry for
24 hours. If the ranger sees proof that his quarry is dead, he
can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.

**Camouflage
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A ranger
of 12th level or higher can use the
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) skill to hide in any
of his favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover
or concealment.

**Improved Evasion
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 16th
level, a ranger's evasion improves. This ability works like
evasion, except that while the ranger still takes no damage on a
successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against attacks, he
henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A
[helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) ranger does not gain the
benefit of improved evasion.

**Hide in Plain Sight
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: While in
any of his favored terrains, a ranger of 17th level or higher can
use the [Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) skill even
while being observed.

**Improved Quarry
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 19th
level, the ranger's ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can
now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while
using [Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) to track his
quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. His insight
bonus to attack his quarry increases to +4. If his quarry is
killed or dismissed, he can select a new one after 10 minutes
have passed.

**Master Hunter
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A ranger
of 20th level becomes a master hunter. He can always move at full
speed while using [Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival)
to follow tracks without penalty. He can, as a standard action,
make a single attack against a favored enemy at his full attack
bonus. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and
must make a [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save or die.
The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ranger's level + the
ranger's [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier. A
ranger can choose instead to deal an amount of nonlethal damage
equal to the creature's current hit points. A successful save
negates this damage. A ranger can use this ability once per day
against each favored enemy type he possesses, but not against the
same creature more than once in a 24-hour period.

Rogue

# Rogue

Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits.
Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning,
skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what
to expect, they prepare for everything, becoming masters of a
wide variety of skills, training themselves to be adept
manipulators, agile acrobats, shadowy stalkers, or masters of any
of dozens of other professions or talents. Thieves and gamblers,
fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, and
explorers and investigators all might be considered rogues, as
well as countless other professions that rely upon wits, prowess,
or luck. Although many rogues favor cities and the innumerable
opportunities of civilization, some embrace lives on the road,
journeying far, meeting exotic people, and facing fantastic
danger in pursuit of equally fantastic riches. In the end, any
who desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms
might come to be called rogues.

**Role**: Rogues excel at moving about unseen and catching foes
unaware, and tend to avoid head-to-head combat. Their varied
skills and abilities allow them to be highly versatile, with
great variations in expertise existing between different rogues.
Most, however, excel in overcoming hindrances of all types, from
unlocking doors and disarming traps to outwitting magical hazards
and conning dull-witted opponents.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

  : Table: Rogue

## Class Features

The following are class features of the rogue.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Rogues are proficient with all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short
sword. They are proficient with light armor, but not with
shields.

**Sneak Attack**: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is
unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can
strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The rogue's attack deals extra damage anytime her target would be
denied a [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) (whether the target actually
has a [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus or
not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is
1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels
thereafter. Should the rogue score a [critical
hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits) with a sneak attack, this
extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak
attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or
an unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals
nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a
weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a
sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.

The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out
a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue
cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment.

**Trapfinding**: A rogue adds 1/2 her level to
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) made to locate traps
and to [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks) (minimum +1). A rogue
can use [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) to disarm
magic traps.

**Evasion [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**:
At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and
unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against an attack that
normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead
takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing
light armor or no armor. A [helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless)
rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

**Rogue Talents**: As a rogue gains experience, she learns a
number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at
2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an
additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained
after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more
than once.

Talents marked with an asterisk add effects to a rogue's sneak
attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual
attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is
made.

*Bleeding Attack\*
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: A rogue
with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting
them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1
additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's
sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of
[bleed](../glossary.html#_bleed)). Bleeding creatures take that
amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns.
The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15
[Heal](../skills/heal.html#_heal) check or the application of any
effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this
ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any
[damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the
creature might possess.

*Combat Trick*: A rogue that selects this talent gains a bonus
[combat feat](../feats.html#_combat-feats) (see
[Feats](../feats.html)).

*Fast Stealth
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: This
ability allows a rogue to move at full speed using the
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) skill without penalty.

*Finesse Rogue*: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon
Finesse](../feats.html#_weapon-finesse) as a bonus feat.

*Ledge Walker
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: This
ability allows a rogue to move along narrow surfaces at full
speed using the
[Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) skill without
penalty. In addition, a rogue with this talent is not
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed) when using
[Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) to move along
narrow surfaces.

*Major Magic*
*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: A rogue with
this talent gains the ability to cast a 1st-level spell from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list two times a day as a [spell-like
ability](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp). The caster
level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. The save DC
for this spell is 11 + the rogue's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.
The rogue must have an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of at least
11 to select this talent. A rogue must have the minor magic rogue
talent before choosing this talent.

*Minor Magic*
*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: A rogue with
this talent gains the ability to cast a 0-level spell from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list. This spell can be cast three times a
day as a [spell-like
ability](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp). The caster
level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. The save DC
for this spell is 10 + the rogue's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.
The rogue must have an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of at least
10 to select this talent.

*Quick Disable
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: It takes a
rogue with this ability half the normal amount of time to disable
a trap using the [Disable
Device](../skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device) skill
(minimum 1 round).

*Resiliency
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: Once per
day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of [temporary
hit points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points) equal to the
rogue's level. Activating this ability is an immediate action
that can only be performed when she is brought to below 0 hit
points. This ability can be used to prevent her from
[dying](../glossary.html#_dying). These [temporary hit
points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points) last for 1 minute.
If the rogue's hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these
[temporary hit points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points), she
falls [unconscious](../glossary.html#_unconscious) and is
[dying](../glossary.html#_dying) as normal.

*Rogue Crawl
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: While
[prone](../glossary.html#_prone), a rogue with this ability can
move at half speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity
as normal. A rogue with this talent can take a 5-foot step while
crawling.

*Slow Reactions\*
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: Opponents
damaged by the rogue's sneak attack can't make attacks of
opportunity for 1 round.

*Stand Up [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*:
A rogue with this ability can stand up from a
[prone](../glossary.html#_prone) position as a free action. This
still provokes attacks of opportunity for standing up while
threatened by a foe.

*Surprise Attack
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: During the
surprise round, opponents are always considered
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed) to a rogue with this
ability, even if they have already acted.

*Trap Spotter
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: Whenever a
rogue with this talent comes within 10 feet of a trap, she
receives an immediate
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) skill check
to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the
GM.

*Weapon Training*: A rogue that selects this talent gains [Weapon
Focus](../feats.html#_weapon-focus) as a bonus feat.

**Trap Sense
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: At 3rd
level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger
from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on [Reflex
saves](../combat.html#_reflex) made to avoid traps and a +1
[dodge bonus](../combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks made by traps.
These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3
when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to
+5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

**Uncanny Dodge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: Starting
at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would
normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed), nor does she lose
her Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is
[invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible). She still loses her
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if immobilized. A rogue with
this ability can still lose her
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to
[AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) if an opponent successfully
uses the feint action (see [Combat](../combat.html)) against her.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

**Improved Uncanny Dodge
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)**: A rogue
of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked.

This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the
character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four
more rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another
class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack
to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the
character.

**Advanced Talents**: At 10th level, and every two levels
thereafter, a rogue can choose one of the following advanced
talents in place of a rogue talent.

*Crippling Strike\**
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: A rogue
with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision
that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one
of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) damage.

*Defensive Roll*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: With this
advanced talent, the rogue can roll with a potentially lethal
blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once
per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by
damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or
special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage.
To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) (DC = damage dealt). If the
save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it
fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and
able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll—if she
is denied her [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity)
bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class), she can't use this
ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character
to make a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half damage,
the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

*Dispelling Attack\*
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: Opponents
that are dealt sneak attack damage by a rogue with this ability
are affected by a targeted *[dispel
magic](../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*, targeting the
lowest-level spell effect active on the target. The caster level
for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have
the major magic rogue talent before choosing dispelling attack.

*Improved Evasion*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: This
works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no
damage on a successful [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving
throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a
failed save. A [helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless) rogue does
not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

*Opportunist*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: Once per
round, the rogue can make an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity) against an
opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another
character. This attack counts as an [attack of
opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity) for that
round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can't use the
opportunist ability more than once per round.

*Skill Mastery*: The rogue becomes so confident in the use of
certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse
conditions.

Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal
to 3 + her [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she
may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally
prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability
multiple times, selecting additional skills for skill mastery to
apply to each time.

*Slippery Mind*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: This
ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from
magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a
rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or
effect and fails her [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws), she can attempt it again 1
round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance
to succeed on her [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws).

*Feat*: A rogue may gain any feat that she qualifies for in place
of a rogue talent.

**Master
Strike***[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*:
Upon reaching 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when
dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak
attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects:
the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours,
[paralyzed](../glossary.html#_paralyzed) for 2d6 rounds, or
slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target receives a
[Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save to negate the
additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
rogue's level + the rogue's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.
Once a creature has been the target of a master strike,
regardless of whether or not the save is made, that creature is
immune to that rogue's master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that
are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this
ability.

Sorcerer

# Sorcerer

Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the
spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of
fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess
and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives
ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these
magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their
mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their
birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as
varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and
inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their
gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through
meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic
birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their
lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live
and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to
mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of
study; it is life itself.

**Role**: Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored
spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As they
become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells,
sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of
magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also
grant them additional abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers
are ever quite alike.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Sorcerers are proficient with
all
[simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons)
weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or
shield. Armor interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can
cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see [Arcane
Spells and Armor](wizard.html#_arcane-spells-and-armor)).

**Spells**: A sorcerer casts arcane spells drawn primarily from
the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in [Spell
Lists](../spellLists.html). She can cast any spell she knows
without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a
sorcerer must have a
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving
throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a sorcerer's spell is
10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain
number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily
spell allotment is given on Table: Sorcerer. In addition, she
receives bonus spells per day if she has a high
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score (see
[Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells
of her choice. At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more
new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike
spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not
affected by her [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.)
These new spells can be common spells chosen from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that
the sorcerer has gained some understanding of through study.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer
level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to
learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect,
the sorcerer loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The
new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being
exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given
level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the
same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her
spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time,
assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that
spell level.

**Bloodline**: Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in
her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional
class skill, and other special abilities. This source can
represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a
creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer
might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather
might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of
the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the
sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon
taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot
be changed.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns
an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are
in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Sorcerer
Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different
spells at higher levels.

At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer
receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each
bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these
bonus feats.

**Cantrips**: Sorcerers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, as noted on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known under “Spells
Known.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do
not consume any slots and may be used again.

**Eschew Materials**: A sorcerer gains [Eschew
Materials](../feats.html#_eschew-materials) as a bonus feat at
1st level.

## Sorcerer Bloodlines {#sorcerer-bloodlines-list}

The following bloodlines represent only some of the possible
sources of power that a sorcerer can draw upon. Unless otherwise
noted, most sorcerers are assumed to have the arcane bloodline.

## Aberrant

There is a taint in your blood, one that is alien and bizarre.
You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle
that most would not expect. Over time, this taint manifests
itself in your physical form.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(dungeoneering).

**Bonus Spells**: *[enlarge
person](../spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person)* (3rd),
*[see
invisibility](../spells/seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility)*
(5th), *[tongues](../spells/tongues.html#_tongues)* (7th),
*[black
tentacles](../spells/blackTentacles.html#_black-tentacles)*
(9th), *[feeblemind](../spells/feeblemind.html#_feeblemind)*
(11th), *[veil](../spells/veil.html#_veil)*(13th), *[plane
shift](../spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift)* (15th), *[mind
blank](../spells/mindBlank.html#_mind-blank)* (17th),
*[shapechange](../spells/shapechange.html#_shapechange)*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting](../feats.html#_combat-casting),
[Improved Disarm](../feats.html#_improved-disarm), [Improved
Grapple](../feats.html#_improved-grapple), [Improved
Initiative](../feats.html#_improved-initiative), [Improved
Unarmed Strike](../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike), [Iron
Will](../feats.html#_iron-will), [Silent
Spell](../feats.html#_silent-spell), [Skill
Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus)
([Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
[dungeoneering]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[polymorph](../magic.html#_polymorph) subschool, increase the
duration of the spell by 50% (minimum 1 round). This bonus does
not stack with the increase granted by the [Extend
Spell](../feats.html#_extend-spell) feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Aberrant sorcerers show increasing signs of
their tainted heritage as they increase in level, although they
are only visible when used.

*Acidic Ray [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
Starting at 1st level, you can fire an acidic ray as a standard
action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack. The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for
every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

*Long Limbs
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 3rd
level, your reach increases by 5 feet whenever you are making a
melee touch attack. This ability does not otherwise increase your
threatened area. At 11th level, this bonus to your reach
increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this bonus to your reach
increases to 15 feet.

*Unusual Anatomy
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 9th
level, your anatomy changes, giving you a 25% chance to ignore
any [critical hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits) or sneak attack
scored against you. This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.

*Alien Resistance
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 15th
level, you gain spell resistance equal to your sorcerer level +
10.

*Aberrant Form
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 20th
level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to
critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight
with a range of 60 feet and [damage
reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/—.

## Abyssal

Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage.
While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is
particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or
evil, but your destiny (and
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)) is up to you.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(planes).

**Bonus Spells**: *[cause
fear](../spells/causeFear.html#_cause-fear)* (3rd), *[bull's
strength](../spells/bullSStrength.html#_bull-s-strength)* (5th),
*[rage](../spells/rage.html#_rage)* (7th),
*[stoneskin](../spells/stoneskin.html#_stoneskin)* (9th),
*[dismissal](../spells/dismissal.html#_dismissal)* (11th),
*[transformation](../spells/transformation.html#_transformation)*
(13th), *[greater
teleport](../spells/teleport.html#_teleport-greater)* (15th),
*[unholy aura](../spells/unholyAura.html#_unholy-aura)* (17th),
*[summon monster
IX](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-ix)* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Augment
Summoning](../feats.html#_augment-summoning),
[Cleave](../feats.html#_cleave), [Empower
Spell](../feats.html#_empower-spell), [Great
Fortitude](../feats.html#_great-fortitude), [Improved Bull
Rush](../feats.html#_improved-bull-rush), [Improved
Sunder](../feats.html#_improved-sunder), [Power
Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), [Skill
Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus)
([Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [planes]).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[summoning](../magic.html#_summoning) subschool, the creatures
summoned gain [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)/good equal
to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with
any [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the creature might
have.

**Bloodline Powers**: While some would say that you are
possessed, you know better. The demonic influence in your blood
grows as you gain power.

*Claws [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At
1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are
treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks
as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. These
attacks deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if you are Small)
plus your [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier.
At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the
purpose of overcoming [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction).
At 7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of
damage (1d4 if you are Small). At 11th level, these claws become
*flaming* *weapons*, each dealing an additional 1d6 points of
fire damage on a successful hit. You can use your claws for a
number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. These
rounds do not need to be consecutive.

*Demon Resistances
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 3rd
level, you gain resist electricity 5 and a +2 bonus on [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) made against poison. At
9th level, your resistance to electricity increases to 10 and
your bonus on poison [saving
throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) increases to +4.

*Strength of the Abyss
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 9th
level, you gain a +2 inherent bonus to your
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength). This bonus
increases to +4 at 13th level, and to +6 at 17th level.

*Added Summonings
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 15th
level, whenever you summon a creature with the demon subtype or
the fiendish template using a *[summon
monster](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-i)* spell,
you summon one additional creature of the same kind.

*Demonic Might*
*[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 20th
level, the power of the Abyss flows through you. You gain
immunity to electricity and poison. You also gain resistance to
acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and gain telepathy with a range of
60 feet (allowing you to communicate with any creature that can
speak a language).

## Arcane

Your family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic.
While many of your relatives were accomplished wizards, your
powers developed without the need for study and practice.

**Class Skill**: [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)
(any one).

**Bonus Spells**: *[identify](../spells/identify.html#_identify)*
(3rd),
*[invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility)*
(5th), *[dispel magic](../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)*
(7th), *[dimension
door](../spells/dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door)*(9th),
*[overland
flight](../spells/overlandFlight.html#_overland-flight)*(11th),
*[true seeing](../spells/trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing)* (13th),
*[greater teleport](../spells/teleport.html#_teleport-greater)*
(15th), *[power word
stun](../spells/powerWordStun.html#_power-word-stun)* (17th),
*[wish](../spells/wish.html#_wish)* (19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Combat Casting](../feats.html#_combat-casting),
[Improved Counterspell](../feats.html#_improved-counterspell),
[Improved Initiative](../feats.html#_improved-initiative), [Iron
Will](../feats.html#_iron-will), [Scribe
Scroll](../feats.html#_scribe-scroll), [Skill
Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus)
([Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [arcana]),
[Spell Focus](../feats.html#_spell-focus), [Still
Spell](../feats.html#_still-spell).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you apply a [metamagic
feat](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats) to a spell that increases
the slot used by at least one level, increase the spell's DC by
+1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to
spells modified by the [Heighten
Spell](../feats.html#_heighten-spell) feat.

**Bloodline Powers**: Magic comes naturally to you, but as you
gain levels you must take care to prevent the power from
overwhelming you.

*Arcane Bond*
*[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 1st
level, you gain an [arcane bond](wizard.html#_arcane-bond), as a
wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels stack
with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of
your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you
to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day, your
bond item allows you to cast any one of our spells known (unlike
a wizard's bonded item, which allows him to cast any one spell in
his spellbook).

*Metamagic Adept
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 3rd
level, you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell
you are about to cast without increasing the casting time. You
must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell.
You can use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one
additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you
possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 19th level. At
20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane apotheosis.

*New Arcana
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 9th
level, you can add any one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell
list to your list of spells known. This spell must be of a level
that you are capable of casting. You can also add one additional
spell at 13th level and 17th level.

*School Power
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 15th
level, pick one school of magic. The DC for any spells you cast
from that school increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the
bonus granted by [Spell Focus](../feats.html#_spell-focus).

*Arcane Apotheosis
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 20th
level, your body surges with arcane power. You can add any
[metamagic feats](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats) that you know
to your spells without increasing their casting time, although
you must still expend higher-level spell slots. Whenever you use
magic items that require charges, you can instead expend spell
slots to power the item. For every three levels of spell slots
that you expend, you consume one less charge when using a magic
item that expends charges.

## Celestial

Your bloodline is blessed by a celestial power, either from a
celestial ancestor or through divine intervention. Although this
power drives you along the path of good, your fate (and
[alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)) is your own to
determine.

**Class Skill**: Heal.

**Bonus Spells**: *[bless](../spells/bless.html#_bless)* (3rd),
*[resist
energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy)*(5th),
*[magic circle against
evil](../spells/magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil)*
(7th), *[remove curse](../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)*
(9th),*[flame strike](../spells/flameStrike.html#_flame-strike)*
(11th), *[greater dispel
magic](../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic-greater)* (13th),
*[banishment](../spells/banishment.html#_banishment)* (15th),
*[sunburst](../spells/sunburst.html#_sunburst)*
(17th),*[gate](../spells/gate.html#_gate)*(19th).

**Bonus Feats**: [Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge), [Extend
Spell](../feats.html#_extend-spell), [Iron
Will](../feats.html#_iron-will),
[Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility), [Mounted
Combat](../feats.html#_mounted-combat), [Ride-By
Attack](../feats.html#_ride-by-attack), [Skill
Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus)
([Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [religion]),
[Weapon Finesse](../feats.html#_weapon-finesse).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Whenever you cast a spell of the
[summoning](../magic.html#_summoning) subschool, the creatures
summoned gain [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)/evil equal
to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with
any [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the creature might
have.

**Bloodline Powers**: Your celestial heritage grants you a great
many powers, but they come at a price. The lords of the higher
planes are watching you and your actions closely.

*Heavenly Fire
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: Starting at
1st level, you can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a standard
action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack. Against evil creatures, this ray deals 1d4 points of
damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. This damage
is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. This
ray heals good creatures of 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every
two sorcerer levels you possess. A good creature cannot benefit
from your heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures
are neither harmed nor healed by this effect. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

*Celestial Resistances
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 3rd
level, you gain resist acid 5 and resist cold 5. At 9th level,
your resistances increase to 10.

*Wings of Heaven
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 9th
level, you can sprout feathery wings and fly for a number of
minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level, with a speed of 60
feet and good maneuverability. This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.

*Conviction [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*:
At 15th level, you can reroll any one ability check, attack roll,
skill check, or [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) you
just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is
rolled, but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must
take the second result, even if it is worse. You can use this
ability once per day.

*Ascension [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*:
At 20th level, you become infused with the power of the heavens.
You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. You also gain
resist electricity 10, resist fire 10, and a +4 racial bonus on
saves against poison. Finally, you gain unlimited use of the
wings of heaven ability. Finally, you gain the ability to speak
with any creature that has a language (as per the
*[tongues](../spells/tongues.html#_tongues)*spell).

## Destined

Your family is destined for greatness in some way. Your birth
could have been foretold in prophecy, or perhaps it occurred
during an especially auspicious event, such as a solar eclipse.
Regardless of your bloodline's origin, you have a great future
ahead.

being, and you can draw upon its power in times of need. At first
level, you must select one of the four elements: air, earth,

level, elemental power surges through your body. You gain
immunity to sneak attacks, critical hits, and damage from your

fey over your magic.

*Laughing Touch*
*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 1st
level, you can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round
as a melee touch attack. A laughing creature can only take a move
action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been
affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24
hours. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)
modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.

level, you can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at

spell-like ability using your sorcerer level as your caster
level.

## Infernal

Somewhere in your family's history, a relative made a deal with a
devil, and that pact has influenced your family line ever since.
In you, it manifests in direct and obvious ways, granting you
powers and abilities. While your fate is still your own, you
can't help but wonder if your ultimate reward is bound to the
Pit.

[charm](../magic.html#_charm) subschool, increase the spell's DC
by +2.

**Bloodline Powers**: You can draw upon the power of Hell,

*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 1st
level, you can cause a creature to become

outsider (see *[detect

creatures that fail their saves are

to your sorcerer level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2
your sorcerer level + your
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. At 9th
level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you
can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use

were born dead before suddenly returning to life. Either way, the
forces of death move through you and touch your every action.

Spell](../feats.html#_still-spell),
[Toughness](../feats.html#_toughness).

**Bloodline Arcana**: Some undead are susceptible to your
mind-affecting spells. Corporeal undead that were once humanoids
are treated as humanoids for the purposes of determining which
spells affect them.

**Bloodline Powers**: You can call upon the foul powers of the
afterlife. Unfortunately, the more you draw upon them, the closer
you come to joining them.

*Grave Touch [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
Starting at 1st level, you can make a melee touch attack as a
standard action that causes a living creature to become
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for a number of rounds equal

[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) creature with this ability, it
becomes [frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened) for 1 round if
it has fewer Hit Dice than your sorcerer level. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

*[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 3rd
level, you gain resist cold 5 and
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/— against nonlethal
damage. At 9th level, your resistance to cold increases to 10 and
your [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) increases to 10/—
against nonlethal damage.

*Grasp of the Dead*
*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 9th
level, you can cause a swarm of skeletal arms to burst from the
ground to rip and tear at your foes. The skeletal arms erupt from
the ground in a 20-foot-radius burst. Anyone in this area takes
1d6 points of slashing damage per sorcerer level. Those caught in
the area receive a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save for half
damage. Those who fail the save are unable to move for 1 round.
The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level +
your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.
The skeletal arms disappear after 1 round. The arms must burst up
from a solid surface. At 9th level, you can use this ability once
per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.
At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This
power has a range of 60 feet.

[incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) for 1 round per
sorcerer level. While in this form, you gain the incorporeal
subtype. You only take half damage from corporeal sources as long
as they are magic (you take no damage from non-magic weapons and
objects). Likewise, your spells deal only half damage to
corporeal creatures. Spells and other effects that do not deal
damage function normally. You can use this ability once per day.

*One of Us*
*[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: At 20th
level, your form begins to rot (the appearance of this decay is
up to you) and undead see you as one of them. You gain immunity
to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. You also gain
[DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/—. Unintelligent
undead do not notice you unless you attack them. You receive a +4
morale bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws)
made against spells and spell-like abilities cast by undead.

Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute
power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms
where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous
and terrible—such mysteries call to those with the ambition and
the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might.
Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek,
collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to
work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some
might choose a particular field of magical study and become
masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in
the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove
a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes,
empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every
desire.

**Role**: While universalist wizards might study to prepare
themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research
schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a
specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are
masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming
any danger.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.

## Class Features

The following are the class features of the wizard.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Wizards are proficient with the
club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff,
but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a
wizard's movements, which can cause his spells with somatic
components to fail.

**Spells**: A wizard casts arcane spells drawn from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in [Spell
Lists](../spellLists.html). A wizard must choose and prepare his
spells ahead of time.

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score equal
to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against a wizard's
spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

A wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell
level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table:
Wizard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
high [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score
(see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus
Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

A wizard may know any number of spells. He must choose and
prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and
spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the
wizard decides which spells to prepare.

**Bonus Languages**: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of
the bonus languages available to the character because of his
race.

**Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp)**: At 1st level, wizards form a powerful
bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two
forms: a [familiar](#familiars) or a bonded object. A familiar is
a magical pet that enhances the wizard's skills and senses and
can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard
can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item.
Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be
changed. Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for
[familiars](#familiars) are at the end of this section.

Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no
cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall
into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand,
or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons
acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If
the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect,
while staves, wands, and weapons must be wielded. If a wizard
attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in
hand, he must make a [concentration
check](../magic.html#_concentration) or lose the spell. The DC
for this check is equal to 20 + the spell's level. If the object
is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot
accordingly.

A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell
that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting,
even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any
other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration,
and other effects dependent on the wizard's level. This spell
cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The
bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizard's
opposition schools (see arcane school).

A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object
as if he has the required [item creation
feats](../feats.html#_item-creation-feats) and if he meets the
level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a
bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities
to the dagger (see the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat in
[Feats](../feats.html)). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses
its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is
not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties
and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a
bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object,
only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded object's
owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being
an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.

If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points
the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an
arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week
in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the
cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to
complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the
additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can
designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This
functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item
except that the new magic item retains its abilities while
gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.

**Arcane School**: A wizard can choose to specialize in one
school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on
that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once
made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a
school receives the universalist school instead.

A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must
select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing
knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery
in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition
schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the
spell. For example, a wizard with evocation as an opposition
school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to
prepare a *fireball*. In addition, a specialist takes a –4
penalty on any [skill checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks)
made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his
opposition schools as a prerequisite. A universalist wizard can
prepare spells from any school without restriction.

Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In
addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of
each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard
can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This
spell must be in the wizard's spellbook. A wizard can select a
spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot,
but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the
universalist school do not receive a school slot.

**Cantrips:** Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or
0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table: Wizard under “Spells
per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they
are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can
prepare a cantrip from a prohibited school, but it uses up two of
his available slots (see below).

**Scribe Scroll**: At 1st level, a wizard gains [Scribe
Scroll](../feats.html#_scribe-scroll) as a bonus feat.

**Bonus Feats**: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard
gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a
[metamagic feat](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats), an [item
creation feat](../feats.html#_item-creation-feats), or [Spell
Mastery](../feats.html#_spell-mastery). The wizard must still
meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level
minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a
character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is
not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic
feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing those feats.

**Spellbooks**: A wizard must study his spellbook each day to
prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in
his spellbook, except for *[read
magic](../spells/readMagic.html#_read-magic)*, which all wizards
can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level
wizard spells (except those from his prohibited schools, if any;
see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice.
The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells
equal to his [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he
gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can
cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any
time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards'
spellbooks to his own (see [Magic](../magic.html)).

## Arcane Schools {#arcane-schools-list}

The following descriptions detail each arcane school and its
corresponding powers.

## Abjuration School

The abjurer uses magic against itself, and masters the art of
defensive and warding magics.

*Resistance
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: You gain
resistance 5 to an energy type of your choice, chosen when you
prepare spells. This resistance can be changed each day. At 11th
level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, this
resistance changes to immunity to the chosen energy type.

*Protective Ward
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: As a
standard action, you can create a 10-foot-radius field of
protective magic centered on you that lasts for a number of
rounds equal to your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.
All allies in this area (including you) receive a +1 deflection
bonus to their [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). This bonus
increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Energy Absorption
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 6th
level, you gain an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times
your wizard level per day. Whenever you take energy damage, apply
immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply
the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that
amount. Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you
normally.

## Conjuration School

The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic
alike to bend to his will.

*Summoner's Charm
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: Whenever
you cast a conjuration ([summoning](../magic.html#_summoning))
spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2
your wizard level (minimum 1). At 20th level, you can change the
duration of all *summon monster* spells to permanent. You can
have no more than one *summon monster* spell made permanent in
this way at one time. If you designate another *[summon
monster](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-i)*spell as
permanent, the previous spell immediately ends.

*Acid Dart [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As
a standard action you can unleash an acid dart targeting any foe
within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acid dart deals 1d6
points of acid damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you
possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 3 + your [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence)
modifier. This attack ignores spell resistance.

*Dimensional Steps
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 8th level,
you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per wizard
level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be
used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an
[attack of opportunity](../combat.html#_attacks-of-opportunity).
You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must
expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature
brought with you.

## Divination School

Diviners are masters of remote viewing, prophecies, and using
magic to explore the world.

*Forewarned [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*:
You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make
a [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) roll to
notice a foe, but you are still considered
[flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed) until you take an
action. In addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks
equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level,
anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a
natural 20.

*Diviner's Fortune
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: When you
activate this school power, you can touch any creature as a
standard action to give it an insight bonus on all of its attack
rolls, [skill checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks), ability
checks, and [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) equal
to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1) for 1 round. You can use
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Scrying Adept
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 8th
level, you are always aware when you are being observed via
magic, as if you had a permanent *[detect
scrying](../spells/detectScrying.html#_detect-scrying)*. In
addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as
one step more familiar to you. Very familiar subjects get a –10
penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.

## Enchantment School

The enchanter uses magic to control and manipulate the minds of
his victims.

*Enchanting Smile
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: You gain a
+2 enhancement bonus on [Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff),
[Diplomacy](../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy), and
[Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate) [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks). This bonus increases
by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, up to a maximum
of +6 at 20th level. At 20th level, whenever you succeed at a
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) against a spell of
the enchantment school, that spell is reflected back at its
caster, as per *[spell
turning](../spells/spellTurning.html#_spell-turning)*.

*Dazing Touch [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
You can cause a living creature to become
[dazed](../glossary.html#_dazed) for 1 round as a melee touch
attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are
unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Aura of Despair
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 8th
level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of despair for a number of
rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Enemies within this
aura take a –2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage
rolls, [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws), and [skill
checks](../usingSkills.html#_skill-checks). These rounds do not
need to be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting effect.

## Evocation School

Evokers revel in the raw power of magic, and can use it to create
and destroy with shocking ease.

*Intense Spells
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: Whenever
you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add 1/2
your wizard level to the damage (minimum +1). This bonus only
applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot
be split between multiple missiles or rays. This bonus damage is
not increased by [Empower Spell](../feats.html#_empower-spell) or
similar effects. This damage is of the same type as the spell. At
20th level, whenever you cast an evocation spell you can roll
twice to penetrate a creature's spell resistance and take the
better result.

*Force Missile*
*[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As a
standard action you can unleash a force missile that
automatically strikes a foe, as *[magic
missile](../spells/magicMissile.html#_magic-missile)*. The force
missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the damage from your
intense spells evocation power. This is a force effect. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Elemental Wall
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 8th level,
you can create a wall of energy that lasts for a number of rounds
per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to
be consecutive. This wall deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire
damage, determined when you create it. The elemental wall
otherwise functions like *[wall of
fire](../spells/wallOfFire.html#_wall-of-fire)*.

## Illusion School

Illusionists use magic to weave confounding images, figments, and
phantoms to baffle and vex their foes.

*Extended Illusions
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: Any
illusion spell you cast with a duration of “concentration” lasts
a number of additional rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level
after you stop maintaining concentration (minimum +1 round). At
20th level, you can make one illusion spell with a duration of
“concentration” become permanent. You can have no more than one
illusion made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate
another illusion as permanent, the previous permanent illusion
ends.

*Blinding Ray [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
As a standard action you can fire a shimmering ray at any foe
within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray causes creatures
to be [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) for 1 round. Creatures
with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are
[dazzled](../glossary.html#_dazzled) for 1 round instead. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Invisibility Field
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: At 8th level,
you can make yourself [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) as
a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to your
wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This
otherwise functions as *[greater
invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility-greater).*

## Necromancy School

The dread and feared necromancer commands undead and uses the
foul power of unlife against his enemies.

*Power over Undead
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: You receive
[Command Undead](../feats.html#_command-undead) or [Turn
Undead](../feats.html#_turn-undead) as a bonus feat. You can
channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier,
but only to use the selected feat. You can take other feats to
add to this ability, such as [Extra
Channel](../feats.html#_extra-channel) and [Improved
Channel](../feats.html#_improved-channel), but not feats that
alter this ability, such as [Elemental
Channel](../feats.html#_elemental-channel) and
Alignment[Channel](../feats.html#_alignment-channel). The DC to
save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level +
your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.
At 20th level, undead cannot add their channel resistance to the
save against this ability.

*Grave Touch [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack that
causes a living creature to become
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for a number of rounds equal
to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). If you touch a
[shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) creature with this ability, it
becomes [frightened](../glossary.html#_frightened) for 1 round if
it has fewer Hit Dice than your wizard level. You can use this
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Life Sight [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*:
At 8th level, you gain blindsight to a range of 10 feet for a
number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. This ability
only allows you to detect living creatures and undead creatures.
This sight also tells you whether a creature is living or undead.
Constructs and other creatures that are neither living nor undead
cannot be seen with this ability. The range of this ability
increases by 10 feet at 12th level, and by an additional 10 feet
for every four levels beyond 12th. These rounds do not need to be
consecutive.

## Transmutation School

Transmuters use magic to change the world around them.

*Physical Enhancement
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: You gain a
+1 enhancement bonus to one physical ability score
([Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength),
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity), or
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution)). This bonus
increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a
maximum of +5 at 20th level. You can change this bonus to a new
ability score when you prepare spells. At 20th level, this bonus
applies to two physical ability scores of your choice.

*Telekinetic Fist
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: As a standard
action you can strike with a telekinetic fist, targeting any foe
within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The telekinetic fist
deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage + 1 for every two wizard
levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times
per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Change Shape [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*:
At 8th level, you can change your shape for a number of rounds
per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to
be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like *[beast
shape II](../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-ii)* or
*[elemental body
I](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-i).* At 12th
level, this ability functions like *[beast shape
III](../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-iii)* or *[elemental
body II](../spells/elementalBody.html#_elemental-body-ii)*.

## Universalist School

Wizards who do not specialize (known as as universalists) have
the most diversity of all arcane spellcasters.

*Hand of the Apprentice
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: You cause
your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike a foe before
instantly returning to you. As a standard action, you can make a
single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This
attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except
that you add your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier on
the attack roll instead of your
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) modifier (damage
still relies on [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength)).
This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) modifier.

*Metamagic Mastery
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: At 8th
level, you can apply any one [metamagic
feat](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats) that you know to a spell
you are about to cast. This does not alter the level of the spell
or the casting time. You can use this ability once per day at 8th
level and one additional time per day for every two wizard levels
you possess beyond 8th. Any time you use this ability to apply a
metamagic feat that increases the spell level by more than 1, you
must use an additional daily usage for each level above 1 that
the feat adds to the spell. Even though this ability does not
modify the spell's actual level, you cannot use this ability to
cast a spell whose modified spell level would be above the level
of the highest-level spell that you are capable of casting.

## Familiars

A familiar is an animal chosen by a spellcaster to aid him in his
study of magic. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack
bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal
it once was, but is now a magical beast for the purpose of
effects that depend on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal
may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function
as a familiar.

A familiar grants special abilities to its master, as given on
the table below. These special abilities apply only when the
master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack
for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend
on the master's level.

If a familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1
week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per
wizard level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.

\*A raven familiar can speak one language of its master's choice
as a supernatural ability.

**Familiar Basics**: Use the basic statistics for a creature of
the familiar's kind, but with the following changes.

*Hit Dice*: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit
Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal
HD total, whichever is higher.

*Hit Points*: The familiar has half the master's total hit points
(not including [temporary hit
points](../combat.html#_temporary-hit-points)), rounded down,
regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

*Attacks*: Use the master's base attack bonus, as calculated from
all his classes. Use the familiar's
[Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) or
[Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier, whichever
is greater, to calculate the familiar's melee attack bonus with
natural weapons.

Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar's kind.

*Saving Throws*: For each [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws), use either the familiar's
base save bonus ([Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) +2,
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) +2, [Will](../combat.html#_will)
+0) or the master's (as calculated from all his classes),
whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers
to saves, and it doesn't share any of the other bonuses that the
master might have on saves.

*Skills*: For each skill in which either the master or the
familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an
animal of that type or the master's skill ranks, whichever is
better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability
modifiers. Regardless of a familiar's total skill modifiers, some
skills may remain beyond the familiar's ability to use. Familiars
treat [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics),
[Climb](../skills/climb.html#_climb),
[Fly](../skills/fly.html#_fly),
[Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception),
[Stealth](../skills/stealth.html#_stealth), and
[Swim](../skills/swim.html#_swim) as class skills.

**Familiar Ability Descriptions**: All familiars have special
abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the
master's combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown
on the table below. The abilities are cumulative.

  Master Class Level   Natural Armor Adj.   Int   Special
  -------------------- -------------------- ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Natural Armor Adj.*: The number noted here is in addition to the
familiar's existing natural armor bonus.

*Int*: The familiar's
[Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score.

*Alertness [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*:
While a familiar is within arm's reach, the master gains the
[Alertness](../feats.html#_alertness) feat.

*Improved Evasion
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: When
subjected to an attack that normally allows a
[Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving throw for half damage, a
familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful [saving
throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) and half damage even if the
[saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) fails.

*Share Spells*: The wizard may cast a spell with a target of
“You” on his familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on himself. A
wizard may cast spells on his familiar even if the spells do not
normally affect creatures of the familiar's type (magical beast).

*Empathic Link
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: The master
has an empathic link with his familiar to a 1 mile distance. The
master can communicate empathically with the familiar, but cannot
see through its eyes. Because of the link's limited nature, only
general emotions can be shared. The master has the same
connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

*Deliver Touch Spells
[(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)*: If the
master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch
spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at
the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his
familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the
touch spell just as the master would. As usual, if the master
casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch
spell dissipates.

*Speak with Master
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: If the
master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can
communicate verbally as if they were using a common language.
Other creatures do not understand the communication without
magical help.

*Speak with Animals of Its Kind
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: If the
master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with
animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire
varieties): bats with bats, cats with felines, hawks and owls and
ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, monkeys with
other simians, rats with rodents, toads with amphibians, and
weasels with ermines and minks. Such communication is limited by
the [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) of the
conversing creatures.

*Spell Resistance
[(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)*: If the
master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance
equal to the master's level + 5. To affect the familiar with a
spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar's
spell resistance.

*Scry on Familiar
[(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)*: If the master
is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if
casting the *scrying*spell) once per day.

## Arcane Spells and Armor

Armor restricts the complicated gestures required while casting
any spell that has a somatic component. The [armor and shield
descriptions](../equipment.html#_armor-descriptions) list the
arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

If a spell doesn't have a somatic component, an arcane
spellcaster can cast it with no arcane spell failure chance while
wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster's
hands are bound or he is grappling (although concentration checks
still apply normally). The metamagic feat [Still
Spell](../feats.html#_still-spell) allows a spellcaster to
prepare or cast a spell without the somatic component at one
spell level higher than normal. This also provides a way to cast
a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.
