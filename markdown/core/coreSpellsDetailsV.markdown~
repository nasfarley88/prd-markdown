**Vampiric touch**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous/1 hour; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You must succeed on a melee touch attack. Your touch deals 1d6
points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6). You gain
temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain
more than the subject's current hit points + the subject's
[Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) score (which
is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points
disappear 1 hour later.

than 30 ft. apart

You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then
maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make
the subjects appear to be anything you wish. The subjects look,
feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them
resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if
slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the
appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10
bonus on the check.

Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making
[Will](../combat.html#_will) saves or with [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance). Those who
interact with the subjects can attempt
[Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief saves to see through the
glamer, but [spell
resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) doesn't help.

You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make
vocally) seem to issue from someplace else. You can speak in any
language you know. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone
who hears the sound and rolls a successful save recognizes it as
illusory (but still hears it).

Vision

**Vision**

**School** divination; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

This spell functions like *[legend
lore](legendLore.html#_legend-lore),*except that it works more
quickly and produces some strain on you. You pose a question
about some person, place, or object, then cast the spell. If the
person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in
question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster
level check (1d20 + 1 per caster level; maximum +25) against DC
20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object
is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is incomplete.
If only rumors are known, the DC is 30, and the information
gained is vague. After this spell is complete, you are
[fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued).
