**Wail of the Banshee**

**School** necromancy [death, sonic]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature/level within a 40-ft.-radius
spread

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]**yes

When you cast this spell, you emit a terrible, soul-chilling
scream that possibly kills creatures that hear it (except for
yourself). The spell affects up to one creature per caster level,
inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. Creatures
closest to the point of origin are affected first.

Wall of Fire

**Wall of Fire**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a piece of phosphor)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** opaque sheet of flame up to 20 ft. long/level or a
ring of fire with a radius of up to 5 ft./two levels; either form
20 ft. high

**Duration** concentration + 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs
into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends
forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to
creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those
past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when
it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each
round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1
point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any
creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to
undead creatures.

If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are,
each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any
5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1
round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as
normal for objects.)

*Wall of fire*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell. A permanent
*wall of fire*that is extinguished by cold damage becomes
inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.

Wall of Force

**Wall of Force**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (powdered quartz)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect**wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level

**Duration** 1 round /level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

A *wall of force* creates an invisible wall of pure force. The
wall cannot move and is not easily destroyed. A *wall of force*
is immune to *[dispel
magic],*although a *[mage's
disjunction]* can
still dispel it*.*A*wall of force*can be damaged by spells as
normal, except
for*[disintegrate],* which
automatically destroys it. It can be damaged by weapons and
supernatural abilities, but a *wall of force* has hardness 30 and
a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with
a *[sphere of
annihilation]*or
*[rod of
cancellation]*
instantly destroys a *wall of force.*

Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through a *wall of force*
in either direction, although *[dimension
door]*,
*[teleport]*, and similar effects can
bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as
material ones (though ethereal creatures can usually circumvent
the wall by going around it, through material floors and
ceilings). Gaze attacks can operate through a *wall of force*.

The caster can form the wall into a flat, vertical plane whose
area is up to one 10-foot square per level. The wall must be
continuous and unbroken when formed. If its surface is broken by
any object or creature, the spell fails.

*Wall of force*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell.

Wall of Ice

**Wall of Ice**

**School** evocation [cold]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a piece of quartz or rock crystal)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level,
or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] negates; see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**
yes

This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of
ice, depending on the version selected. A *wall of ice*cannot
form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its
surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature
adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a
[Reflex] save to disrupt the wall as it
is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell
automatically fails. Fire can melt a *wall of ice,*and it deals
full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken
by objects). Suddenly melting a *wall of ice*creates a great
cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.

*Ice Plane*: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1
inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square
area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a *wall
of ice* 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and
20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that
does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in
any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only
be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall
must be anchored on two opposite sides.

Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of
thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of
wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries
to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the
Strength check is 15 + caster level.

Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air
remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who
broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point
per caster level (no save).

*Hemisphere*: The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose
maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The
*hemisphere*is as hard to break through as the *ice plane*form,
but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

Wall of Iron

**Wall of Iron**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a small iron sheet plus gold dust worth
50 gp)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** iron wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level;
see text

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You cause a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The
wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if
its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so
that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.
It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to
fit the available space.

A *wall of iron*is 1 inch thick per four caster levels. You can
double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot
square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and
hardness 10. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is
breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a
single attack, the DC for the
[Strength] check is 25 + 2 per
inch of thickness.

If you desire, the wall can be created vertically resting on a
flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be
tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall
is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left unpushed.
Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting
it fall randomly. A creature must make a DC 40
[Strength] check to push the
wall over. Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so
by making successful [Reflex] saves. Any
Large or smaller creature that fails takes 10d6 points of damage
while fleeing from the wall. The wall cannot crush Huge and
larger creatures.

Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation,
and other natural phenomena. Iron created by this spell is not
suitable for use in the creation of other objects and cannot be
sold.

Wall of Stone

**Wall of Stone**

**School** conjuration (creation) [earth]; **Level** cleric 5,
druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small block of granite)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** stone wall whose area is up to one 5-ft. square/level
(S)

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell creates a wall of rock that merges into adjoining rock
surfaces. A *wall of stone*is 1 inch thick per four caster levels
and composed of up to one 5-foot square per level. You can double
the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be
conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or
another object.

Unlike a *[wall of iron],*you can
create a *wall of stone*in almost any shape you desire. The wall
created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation;
however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing
stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a
ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall
must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the
spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow
crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the
area.

Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a
*[disintegrate]*spell or by
normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of
the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness.
A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a
creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack,
the DC for the [Strength] check
is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.

It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or
under a *wall of stone*, provided the wall is shaped so it can
hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with
successful [Reflex] saves.

Wall of Thorns

**Wall of Thorns**

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** druid 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect**wall of thorny brush, up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

A *wall of thorns*spell creates a barrier of very tough, pliable,
tangled brush bearing needle-sharp thorns as long as a human's
finger. Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a
*wall of thorns*takes piercing damage per round of movement equal
to 25 minus the creature's [AC].
[Dexterity] and [dodge
bonus]es to
[AC] do not count for this
calculation. 
of 25 or higher, without considering
[Dexterity] and [dodge
bonus]es, take no damage from
contact with the wall.)

You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you
to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal
to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage
dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through
takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.

Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a
[Strength] check as a
full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds
20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to
its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move
through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature
trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to
avoid taking any more damage.

Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes
damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In
order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can
wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass
through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a *wall of
thorns*at normal speed without taking damage.

A *wall of thorns*can be breached by slow work with edged
weapons. Chopping away at the wall creates a safe passage 1 foot
deep for every 10 minutes of work. Normal fire cannot harm the
barrier, but magical fire burns it away in 10 minutes.

Warp Wood

**Warp Wood**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft.
radius

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its
straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or
becomes stuck, requiring a
[Strength] check to open, at
your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged
weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a –4 penalty on
attack rolls.

You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per
caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a
Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object
as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back
to normal) with this spell. *[Make
whole]*, on the other hand, does no
good in repairing a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive *warp wood*spells to warp
(or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a
single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers
no ill effects.

Water Breathing

**Water Breathing**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3,
sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (short reed or piece of straw)

**Range** touch

**Target** living creatures touched

**Duration** 2 hours/level; see text

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The transmuted creatures can breathe water freely. Divide the
duration evenly among all the creatures you touch. The spell does
not make creatures unable to breathe air.

Water Walk

**Water Walk**

**School** transmutation [water]; **Level** cleric 3, ranger 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** one touched creature/level

**Duration** 10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The transmuted creatures can tread on any liquid as if it were
firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and
even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjects' feet hover
an inch or two above the surface. Creatures crossing molten lava
still take damage from the heat because they are near it. The
subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the
surface as if it were normal ground.

If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are
partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in),
the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round
until they can stand on it.

Waves of Exhaustion

**Waves of Exhaustion**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** no; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Waves of negative energy cause all living creatures in the
spell's area to become [exhausted].
This spell has no effect on a creature that is already
[exhausted].

Waves of Fatigue

**Waves of Fatigue**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 30 ft.

**Area** cone-shaped burst

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** no; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Waves of negative energy render all living creatures in the
spell's area [fatigued]. This spell
has no effect on a creature that is already
[fatigued].

Web

**Web**

**School**conjuration (creation); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (spider web)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect**webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration**10 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Reflex] negates; see
text; **[Spell
Resistance]**no

*Web*creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These
strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to
spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be
anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or
else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures
caught within a web become [grappled]
by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a web doesn't cause
you to become [grappled].

Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a
[Reflex] save. If this save succeeds, the
creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the
save fails, the creature gains the
[grappled] condition, but can break
free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as
a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area
of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through
the webs must make a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check
as part of their move action, with a DC equal to the spell's DC.
Creatures that fail lose their movement and become
[grappled] in the first square of
webbing that they enter.

If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent,
it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between
you, it provides total cover.

The strands of a *web*spell are flammable. A *flaming weapon*can
slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any
fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1
round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire
damage from the flames.

*Web*can be made permanent with a
*[permanency]*spell. A permanent web
that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

Weird

**Weird**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 9

**Targets** any number of creatures, no two of which can be more
than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like *[phantasmal
killer]*, except it can
affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see
the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the
attackers as shadowy shapes.

If a subject's [Fortitude] save
succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is
[stunned] for 1 round. The subject
also takes 1d4 points of
[Strength] damage.

Whirlwind

**Whirlwind**

**School** evocation [air]; **Level** druid 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Effect** cyclone 10 ft. wide at base, 30 ft. wide at top, and
30 ft. tall

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] negates; see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**
yes

This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves
through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60
feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's
every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the
cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a
standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your
turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a
random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates.
(You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back
within range.)

Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the
spell effect must succeed on a [Reflex]
save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature
that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be
picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its
powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your
turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject
any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless
souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

Whispering Wind

**Whispering Wind**

**School** transmutation [air]; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard
2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 1 mile/level

**Area** 10-ft.-radius spread

**Duration** no more than 1 hour/level or until discharged
(destination is reached)

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The
*whispering wind*travels to a specific location within range that
is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the
location. A *whispering wind*is as gentle and unnoticed as a
zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its
whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is
delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The
wind then dissipates.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25
words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or
merely have the *whispering wind*seem to be a faint stirring of
the air. You can likewise cause the *whispering wind*to move as
slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in
place until the message is delivered. As with *magic mouth,
whispering wind*cannot speak verbal components, use command
words, or activate magical effects.

Wind Walk

**Wind Walk**

**School** transmutation [air]; **Level** cleric 6, druid 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Targets** you and one touched creature per three levels

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D); see text

**Saving Throw** no and [Will] negates
(harmless); **[Spell
Resistance]** no and yes
(harmless)

You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor (as the
*[gaseous form]*spell) and move
through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other
creatures with you, each of which acts independently.

Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect
maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts
a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with
poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not
[invisible] but rather appear misty
and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely
to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.

A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later
resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form
takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as
does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can
dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual
wind walkers and not others.

For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in
cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total
of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This
descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.

Wind Wall

**Wind Wall**

**School** evocation [air]; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3, ranger
2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a tiny fan and an exotic feather)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect**wall up to 10 ft./level long and 5 ft./level high (S)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick
and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to
blow away any bird smaller than an eagle, or tear papers and
similar materials from unsuspecting hands. (A
[Reflex] save allows a creature to
maintain its grasp on an object.) Tiny and Small flying creatures
cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth
garments fly upward when caught in a *wind wall.*Arrows and bolts
are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged
weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (A
giant-thrown boulder, a siege engine projectile, and other
massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous
breath weapons, and creatures in [gaseous
form] cannot pass through the
wall (although it is no barrier to
[incorporeal] creatures).

While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any
continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to
create cylindrical or square *wind walls* to enclose specific
points.

Wish

**Wish**

**School**universal; **Level**sorcerer/wizard 9

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (diamond worth 25,000 gp)

**Range**see text

**Target, Effect, Area**see text

**Duration**see text

**Saving Throw** none, see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

*Wish*is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
Even *wish*, however, has its limits. A *wish*can produce any one
of the following effects.

-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 8th level or lower,
    provided the spell does not belong to one of your opposition
    schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or
    lower, provided the spell does not belong to one of your
    opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 7th level or lower,
    even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Duplicate any non-sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or
    lower, even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools.
-   Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as
    *[geas/quest]*or
    *[insanity]*.
-   Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two
    to five *wish* spells cast in immediate succession can grant
    a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score (two
    *wishes* for a +2 inherent bonus, three *wishes* for a +3
    inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are
    instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. *Note*: An
    inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability score,
    and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not
    stack, so only the best one applies.
-   Remove injuries and afflictions. A single *wish*can aid one
    creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of the
    same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the
    damage you and your companions have taken, or remove all
    poison effects from everyone in the party, but not do both
    with the same *wish*.
-   Revive the dead. A *wish*can bring a dead creature back to
    life by duplicating a
    *[resurrection]*spell. A
    *wish*can revive a dead creature whose body has been
    destroyed, but the task takes two *wishes*: one to recreate
    the body and another to infuse the body with life again. A
    *wish*cannot prevent a character who was brought back to life
    from gaining a permanent negative level.
-   Transport travelers. A *wish*can lift one creature per caster
    level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures
    anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An
    unwilling target gets a [Will] save to
    negate the effect, and [spell
    resistance] (if any)
    applies.
-   Undo misfortune. A *wish*can undo a single recent event. The
    *wish*forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round
    (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
    accommodate the new result. For example, a *wish*could undo
    an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical
    hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's
    failed save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as
    or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a
    [Will] save to negate the effect, and
    [spell resistance] (if
    any) applies.

You may try to use a *wish*to produce greater effects than these,
but doing so is dangerous. (The *wish*may pervert your intent
into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial
fulfillment, at the GM's discretion.)

Duplicated spells allow saves and [spell
resistance] as normal (but
save DCs are for 9th-level spells).

When a *wish*duplicates a spell with a material component that
costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component (in
addition to the 25,000 gp diamond component for this spell).

Wood Shape

**Wood Shape**

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

W*ood shape*enables you to form one existing piece of wood into
any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make
crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn't possible.
There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts
simply doesn't work.

Word of Chaos

**Word of Chaos**

**School** evocation [chaotic, sonic]; **Level** cleric 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** 40 ft.

**Area** nonchaotic creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered
on you

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none or [Will] negates;
see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Any nonchaotic creature within the area of a *word of chaos*spell
suffers the following ill effects, depending on their HD.

  HD                       Effect
  ------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Equal to caster level    [Deafened]
  Up to caster level –1    [Stunned], [deafened]
  Up to caster level –5    [Confused], [stunned], [deafened]
  Up to caster level –10   Killed, [confused], [stunned], [deafened]

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful
[Will] save reduces or eliminates these
effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one
save and apply the result to all the effects.

*Deafened*: The creature is
[deafened] for 1d4 rounds. Save
negates.

*Stunned*: The creature is [stunned]
for 1 round. Save negates.

*Confused*: The creature is
[confused] for 1d10 minutes. This is
a mind-affecting enchantment effect. Save reduces the
[confused] effect to 1 round.

*Killed*: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.
Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead
takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are
instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so
banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes
place regardless of whether the creatures hear the *word of
chaos*or not*.*The banishment effect allows a
[Will] save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose HD exceed your caster level are unaffected by
*word of chaos.*

Word of Recall

**Word of Recall**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** cleric 6, druid
8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** unlimited

**Target** you and touched objects or other willing creatures

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none or [Will] negates
(harmless, object); **[Spell
Resistance]** no or yes
(harmless, object)

*Word of recall*teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary
when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when
you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The
actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10
feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a
plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in
addition to yourself, any objects you carry, as long as their
weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one
additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or
objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three
caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a
Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All
creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another,
and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

An unwilling creature can't be teleported by *word of
recall.*Likewise, a creature's [Will] save
)
prevents items in its possession from being teleported.
Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.
