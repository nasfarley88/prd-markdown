**Baleful Polymorph**

**School** transmutation (polymorph); **Level** druid 5,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target**one creature

**Duration**permanent

**Saving Throw**: [Fortitude] negates,
[Will] partial, see text; **[Spell
Resistance]**: yes

As *[beast shape III],*except
that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no
more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the
creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject
gets a +4 bonus on the save.

If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a
[Will] save. If this second save fails, the
creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like
abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the
ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and
[Intelligence],
[Wisdom], and
[Charisma] scores of its
new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and
level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such
as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It
retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't
extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled
when a target fails to resist the effects of *baleful polymorph*,
and as long as *baleful polymorph* remains in effect, the target
cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new
form. [Incorporeal] or gaseous
creatures are immune to *baleful polymorph*, and a creature with
the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a
standard action.

**Level** cleric 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 50 ft.

**Area** 50-ft.-radius burst, centered on you

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell

Banishment

**Banishment**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (see text)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which
can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

A *banishment*spell is a more powerful version of the
*[dismissal]*spell. It enables you to
force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2
Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished.

You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at
least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or
otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a
+1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's
[spell resistance] (if any),
and the saving throw DC increases by 2.

Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for
the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the
caster level check against [spell
resistance] and increasing
the save DC by 4).

Barkskin

**Barkskin**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2, ranger 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

*Barkskin*toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2
enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus.
This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster
levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.

The enhancement bonus provided by *barkskin*stacks with the
target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement
bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an
effective natural armor bonus of +0.

Bear's Endurance

**Bear's Endurance**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from
a bear)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The
spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to
[Constitution], which adds
the usual benefits to hit points,
[Fortitude] saves,
[Constitution] checks, and
so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in
[Constitution] score are
not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's
[Constitution] drops back
to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 6, druid 6,

Bestow Curse

**Bestow Curse**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** permanent

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

You place a curse on the subject. Choose one of the following.

    checks.
-   Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally;

*[limited wish]*,
*[miracle]*, *[remove
curse]*, or
*[wish]*spell.

*Bestow curse*counters *[remove

Binding

**Binding**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (opals worth 500 gp per HD of the target
creature, plus other components as specified below)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** see text (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates; see text;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

A *binding*spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature.
The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice
equal at least half your caster level.

You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.
For each assistant who casts
*[suggestion]*, your caster level
for this casting of *binding*increases by 1. For each assistant
who casts *[dominate
animal], [dominate
person],*or *[dominate
monster],*your caster
level for this casting of *binding*increases by a number equal to
a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's
target is appropriate for a *binding*spell. Since the assistants'
spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the
purpose of the *binding*spell, saving throws and [spell
resistance] against the
assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines
whether the target gets an initial [Will]
saving throw and how long the *binding*lasts. All *binding*spells
are dismissible.

Regardless of the version of *binding*you cast, you can specify
triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature
whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate
as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a
likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a
creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be
based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as
level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the
spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.
Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a
saving throw is allowed) by 2.

If you cast any of the first three versions of *binding*(those
with limited durations), you may cast additional *binding*spells
to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so,
the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's
duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow
an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all
*binding*spells it has received are broken.

The *binding*spell has six versions. Choose one of the following
versions when you cast the spell.

*Chaining*: The subject is confined by restraints that generate
an *[antipathy]*spell affecting all
creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1
year per caster level. The subject of this form of *binding*is
confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.
Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap
around the creature three times.

*Slumber*: This version causes the subject to become comatose for
as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to
eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of
*binding*is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC
by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals.
This is a [sleep] effect.

*Bound Slumber*: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts
for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.
Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand
or rose petals. This is a [sleep] effect.

*Hedged Prison*: The subject is transported to or otherwise
brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any
means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting
this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is
consumed when the spell is cast.

*Metamorphosis*: The subject assumes [gaseous
form], except for its head or
face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may
be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of
its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the
container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The
*binding*is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat,
or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC
by 4.

*Minimus Containment*: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1
inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.
The *binding*is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe,
eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save
DC by 4.

You can't dispel a *binding*spell with *[dispel
magic]*or a similar effect,
though an *[antimagic
field]*or *[mage's
disjunction]*affects
it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to
its home plane by *[dismissal],
banishment,*or a similar effect.

Black Tentacles

**Black Tentacles**

**School**conjuration (creation); **Level**sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S, M (octopus or squid tentacle)

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Area**20-ft.-radius spread

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw**: none; **[Spell
Resistance]**: no

This spell causes a field of rubbery black tentacles to appear,
burrowing up from the floor and reaching for any creature in the
area.

Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a
combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning
of your turn, including the round that *black tentacles* is cast.
Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically
attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity.
When determining the tentacles'
[CMB], the tentacles use
your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4
bonus due to their [Strength]
and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect
each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of
effect.

If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4
points of damage and gains the
[grappled] condition. Grappled
opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All
other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the
grapple first. The *black tentacles* spell receives a +5 bonus on
grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling,
but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that *black
tentacles* succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional
1d6+4 points of damage. The
[CMD] of *black
tentacles*, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to
10 + its [CMB].

The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they
can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is
considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.

Blade Barrier

**Blade Barrier**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** cleric 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect**wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/level, or a
ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per
two levels; either form is 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** [Reflex] half or
[Reflex] negates; see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure
force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the
wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6),
with a [Reflex] save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are,
each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each
such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its
choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful
[Reflex] save.

A *blade barrier*provides cover (+4 bonus to
[AC], +2 bonus on
[Reflex] saves) against attacks made
through it.

Blasphemy

**Blasphemy**

**School**evocation [evil, sonic]; **Level**cleric 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range**40 ft.

**Area**nonevil creatures in a 40-ft.-radius spread centered on
you

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will] partial; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes

Any nonevil creature within the area of a *blasphemy*spell
suffers the following ill effects.

  HD                       Effect
  ------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Equal to caster level    [Dazed]
  Up to caster level –1    Weakened, [dazed]
  Up to caster level –5    [Paralyzed], weakened, [dazed]
  Up to caster level –10   Killed, paralyzed, weakened, [dazed]

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful
[Will] save reduces or eliminates these
effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one
save and apply the result to all the effects.

*Dazed*: The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it
defends itself normally. Save negates.

*Weakened*: The creature's
[Strength] score decreases by
2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. Save for half.

*[Paralyzed]*: The creature is
paralyzed and [helpless] for 1d10
minutes. Save reduces the
[paralyzed] effect to 1 round.

*Killed*: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.
Save negates. If the save is successful, the creature instead
takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum
+25).

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this
spell, nonevil extraplanar creatures within the area are
instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so
banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes
place regardless of whether the creatures hear the *blasphemy* or
not*.*The banishment effect allows a [Will]
save (at a –4 penalty) to negate.

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected
by *blasphemy.*

Bleed

**Bleed**

**School**necromancy; **Level**cleric 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw**: [Will] negates; **[Spell
Resistance]**: yes

You cause a living creature that is below 0 hit points but
stabilized to resume [dying]. Upon
casting this spell, you target a living creature that has –1 or
fewer hit points. That creature begins dying, taking 1 point of
damage per round. The creature can be stabilized later normally.
This spell causes a creature that is dying to take 1 point of
damage.

Bless

**Bless**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
cleric 1, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** 50 ft.

**Area** The caster and all allies within a 50-ft. burst,
centered on the caster

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)

*Bless*fills your allies with courage. Each ally gains a +1
morale bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear
effects.

*Bless*counters and dispels *[bane]*.

Bless Water

**Bless Water**

**School** transmutation [good]; **Level** cleric 1, paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S, M (5 pounds of powdered silver worth 25 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** flask of water touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (object);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(object)

This transmutation imbues a flask (1 pint) of water with positive
energy, turning it into [holy
water].

Bless Weapon

**Bless Weapon**

**School** transmutation; **Level** paladin 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target**weapon touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This transmutation makes a weapon strike true against evil foes.
The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the
purpose of bypassing the [DR]
of evil creatures or striking evil
[incorporeal] creatures (though
the spell doesn't grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon
also becomes good-aligned, which means it can bypass the
[DR] of certain creatures.
(This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the
weapon might have.) Individual arrows or bolts can be transmuted,
but affected projectile weapons (such as bows) don't confer the
benefit to the projectiles they shoot.

In addition, all critical hit rolls against evil foes are
automatically successful, so every threat is a critical hit. This
last effect does not apply to any weapon that already has a
magical effect related to critical hits, such as a *keen* weapon
or a *vorpal sword*.

Blight

**Blight**

**School** necromancy; **Level** druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** plant touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] half; see
text; **[Spell Resistance]**
yes

This spell withers a single plant of any size. An affected plant
creature takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 15d6) and
may attempt a [Fortitude] saving throw
for half damage. A plant that isn't a creature doesn't receive a
save and immediately withers and dies.

This spell has no effect on the soil or surrounding plant life.

Blindness/Deafness

**Blindness/Deafness**

**School** necromancy; **Level** bard 2, cleric 3,
sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** permanent (D)

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude] negates;
**[Spell Resistance]** yes

You call upon the powers of unlife to render the subject
[blinded] or
[deafened], as you choose.

Blink

**Blink**

**School**transmutation; **Level**bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**personal

**Target**you

**Duration**1 round/level (D)

You “blink” quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and
the Ethereal Plane and look as though you're winking in and out
of reality at random. *Blink*has several effects, as follows.

Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the
Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal
and not merely [invisible]. If the
attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance
is only 20% (for concealment).

If the attacker can see [invisible]
creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who
can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss
chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since
you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.

Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against
you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target
[invisible], ethereal creatures.
Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go
ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material
Plane (but they might affect targets on the Ethereal Plane).

While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks (but
full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane).
Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered
[invisible] and targets retain their
[Dexterity] bonus to
[AC] against your attacks. You do
receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that
cannot see [invisible] creatures.

You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while
you are material.

While blinking, you can step through (but not see through) solid
objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through,
there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs,
you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points
of damage per 5 feet so traveled.

Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you
can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with
ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with
material ones.

An ethereal creature is [invisible],
[incorporeal], and capable of
moving in any direction, even up or down. As an
[incorporeal] creature, you can
move through solid objects, including living creatures.

An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but
everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the
Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects
extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not
vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures,
and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal
things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or
effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal
creatures and objects as material.

Blur

**Blur**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw**[Will] negates (harmless);
**[Spell Resistance]** yes
(harmless)

The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering.
This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A *[see
invisibility]*spell does
not counteract the *blur*effect, but a *[true
seeing]*spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect
(though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its
own).

Break Enchantment

**Break Enchantment**

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 4, cleric 5, paladin 4,
sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 minute

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** up to one creature per level, all within 30 ft. of
each other

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** no

This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and
curses. *Break enchantment*can reverse even an instantaneous
effect. For each such effect, you make a caster level check (1d20
+ caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of
the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell,
curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is equal to the
DC of the curse.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by *[dispel
magic]* or *stone to flesh*,
*break enchantment*works only if that spell is 5th level or
lower.

If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, *break
enchantment*does not remove the curse from the item, but it does
free the victim from the item's effects.

Breath of Life

**Breath of Life**

**School**conjuration (healing); **Level**cleric 5

**Casting Time**1 standard action

**Components**V, S

**Range**touch

**Target**creature touched

**Duration**instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will] negates (harmless)
or [Will] half, see text; **[Spell
Resistance]** yes (harmless)
or yes, see text

This spell cures 5d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level
(maximum +25).

Unlike other spells that heal damage, *breath of life* can bring
recently slain creatures back to life. If cast upon a creature
that has died within 1 round, apply the healing from this spell
to the creature. If the healed creature's hit point total is at a
negative amount less than its
[Constitution] score, it
comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If
the creature's hit point total is at a negative amount equal to
or greater than its
[Constitution] score, the
creature remains dead. Creatures brought back to life through
*breath of life* gain a temporary [negative
level]that
lasts for 1 day.

Creatures slain by death effects cannot be saved by *breath of
life*.

Like cure spells, *breath of life* deals damage to undead
creatures rather than curing them, and cannot bring them back to
life.
