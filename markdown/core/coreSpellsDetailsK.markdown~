**Keen Edge**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one weapon or 50 projectiles, all of which must be
together at the time of casting

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless,
object); **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless,
object)

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability
to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat
range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19–20, a threat
range of 19–20 becomes 17–20, and a threat range of 18–20 becomes
15–20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing
weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the *keen edge*on a
particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the
missile strikes its intended target. Treat shuriken as arrows,
rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Multiple effects that increase a weapon's threat range (such as
the *keen*special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat)
don't stack. You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such
as a claw.

Knock

**Knock**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range**medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one door, box, or chest with an area of up to 10 sq.
ft./level

**Duration** instantaneous; see text

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** no

K*nock*opens stuck, barred, or locked doors, as well as those
subject to *[hold portal](holdPortal.html#_hold-portal)*or
*[arcane lock](arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock)*. When you complete
the casting of this spell, make a caster level check against the
DC of the lock with a +10 bonus. If successful, *knock*opens up
to two means of closure. This spell opens secret doors, as well
as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens
welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold something
shut). If used to open an *[arcane
lock](arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock)ed*door, the spell does not
remove the *[arcane lock](arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock)*but
simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes. In all other
cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on
its own. *Knock*does not raise barred gates or similar
impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes,
vines, and the like. The effect is limited by the area. Each
casting can undo as many as two means of preventing access.

Know Direction

**Know Direction**

**School** divination; **Level** bard 0, druid 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you instantly know the direction of
north from your current position. The spell is effective in any
environment in which “north” exists, but it may not work in
extraplanar settings. Your knowledge of north is correct at the
moment of casting, but you can get lost again within moments if
you don't find some external reference point to help you keep
track of direction.
