**Zone of Silence**

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Area** 5-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

By casting *zone of silence*, you manipulate sound waves in your
immediate vicinity so that you and those within the spell's area
can converse normally, yet no one outside can hear your voices or
any other noises from within, including language-dependent or
sonic spell effects. This effect is centered on you and moves
with you. Anyone who enters the zone immediately becomes subject
to its effects, but those who leave are no longer affected. Note,
however, that a successful DC 20 Linguistics check to read lips
can still reveal what's said inside a *zone of silence.*

Zone of Truth

**Zone of Truth**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level**
cleric 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw**[Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell
Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can't
speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially
affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the
spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation
area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment.
Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would
normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as
they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who
leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
