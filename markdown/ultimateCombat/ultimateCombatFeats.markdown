## Feats

Feats represent special tricks or abilities a character has
acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his birth. They
grant characters abilities that others lack, giving them an edge
in the right situation. While some feats specifically interact
with a PC's race or class, most are available to anyone who meets
the prerequisites. This section introduces two new types of
feats—grit feats and style feats. Grit feats expand a
gunslinger's ability to use grit and deeds, while style feats
each grant a style of martial arts that can be used by monks and
other characters who learn the style.

## Types of Feats

While most of the feats presented here are general and have no
special rules governing them, some feats belong to a type or
types of feats that feature special shared rules. The type or
types a feat belongs to appear in parentheses after the feat
name. This chapter features the following types of feats.

### Combat Feats

Fighters and gunslingers can select combat feats as bonus
feats. Member of other classes can take these feats as long as
they meet the prerequisites.

### Critical Feats

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting
an additional condition on the victim. Characters without the
[Critical
Mastery] feat
can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual
critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide
which feat to apply after confirming a critical hit.

### [Grit Feats]

Grit feats interact with the gunslinger's grit class ability or
the grit granted by the [Amateur Gunslinger] feat, usually by
adding to her set of deeds. Sometimes these feats increase the
number of grit points a character has or how that character
regains grit points. Gunslingers can take grit feats as bonus
feats.

### Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify their spells,
granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally
take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For
complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells.

### [Performance Feats]

Performance feats are used when you make a performance combat
check, typically granting a special action that occurs when you
make that check. Unless you have the Masterful Display feat, you
can only apply the effect of one performance feat to each
performance combat check you make.

### [Style Feats]

For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the
multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and
contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting
styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and
supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques
were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to
practitioners the world over.

As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the
fighting style a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a
style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists
until you spend a swift action to switch to a different combat
style. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite
only while in the stance of the associated style. For example, if
you have feats associated with Mantis Style and Tiger Style, you
can use a swift action to adopt Tiger Style at the start of one
turn, and then can use other feats that have Tiger Style as a
prerequisite. By using another swift action at the start of your
next turn, you could adopt Mantis Style and use other feats that
have Mantis Style as a prerequisite.

The styles presented follow, along with specific feat paths—feats
that complement each style.

**Boar Style**: A tribe of orcs who disdained the use of weapons
 originally developed this savage unarmed fighting style. They
 preferred to slaughter their enemies with their bare hands and
 teeth. Over the centuries, a variety of races have adopted the
 Boar Style, most notably goblinoids, ogres, and trolls. The
 objective of the Boar Style is to attack with as much
 viciousness and cruelty as possible in order to break enemy
 morale. Fanatical followers of the style use herbal and
 alchemical reagents to harden their nails and teeth, sometimes
 performing self-mutilating procedures that result in clawlike
 nails and sharpened teeth.\ Feat Path*: [Boar
 Style,][Boar Ferocity], [Boar
 Shred].


**Crane Style**: Crane style focuses on defense and agile
 counterattacks. Practitioners are known for graceful,
 one-legged stances and folding arm techniques that mimic a
 crane's enormous wings.\ Feat Path*: [Crane
 Style], [Crane Wing], [Crane
 Riposte].

**Djinni Style**: Adherents to this style call on the spirits of
 storms to outmaneuver and outwit their opponents. Masters of
 the style can absorb and deflect electrical attacks while
 summoning peals of thunder to pummel their enemies.\ Feat
 Path*: [Djinni Style], [Djinni
 Spirit], [Djinni Spin].

**Dragon Style**: Dragon style captures the overwhelming power,
 grace, and ferocity of dragons. Practitioners use acrobatic
 footwork and strong attacks to overwhelm foes. The deepest
 secrets of the style require imbibing alchemical tonics and
 deep meditations similar to the long sleeps of dragons.\ Feats
 Path*: [Dragon Style], [Dragon
 Ferocity], [Dragon Roar].

**Earth Child Style**: A warrior cadre of dwarves and gnomes
 dedicated to fighting and slaying giants developed this
 style. Students of the style learn how to enhance their
 defensive training to become even more elusive when facing
 giants. They also spend long hours studying the anatomy of the
 various giant races to increase the effectiveness of their
 unarmed strikes. Eventually, masters of this fighting style
 learn how to bring down even the mightiest creatures by
 targeting feet, ankles, and knees.\ Feat Path*: [Earth Child
 Style], [Earth Child
 Topple], [Earth Child
 Binder].

**Efreeti Style**: The efreeti style focuses on aggression and
 speed, taking inspiration from beings of living fire. Masters
 of the style can deflect and control fire, immolate their
 enemies, and summon forth gouts of elemental flame.\ Feats
 Path*: [Efreeti Style], [Efreeti
 Stance], [Efreeti Touch].

**Janni Style**: This style, originating humbly from the folk
 traditions of disparate peoples, represents several similar
 unarmed fighting arts practiced around the world. Regardless of
 variations in technique, all practitioners have a fluid
 fighting stance that emphasizes rapid, powerful kicks. The
 style's constant motion and graceful footwork lead many to
 mistakenly view practitioners as highly skilled dancers, a
 misconception that has allowed the technique to be taught in
 secret, the hidden weapon of the downtrodden and the
 oppressed. Openly martial versions of this style lose some of
 the dancelike qualities but retain the style's extraordinary
 kicking techniques and agility.\ Feat Path*: [Janni
 Style], [Janni Tempest], [Janni
 Rush].


**Kirin Style**: The school of the kirin employs critical
 observations as weapons against opponents. Practitioners
 catalogue a foe's weaknesses and seek the perfect moment to
 strike, ensuring that no movement or effort is ever
 wasted. Popular among those rare orders that blend monastic
 training with arcane study, kirin style is sometimes practiced
 by wizards who seek to hone their bodies along with their
 minds.\ Feat Path*: [Kirin Style], [Kirin
 Strike], [Kirin Path].

**Mantis Style**: Based on the hunting techniques of the praying
 mantis, practitioners of this style fight with their hands
 turned down to emulate the insect's sharp grasping
 forelimbs. Mantis style uses precise, accurate strikes to
 pinpoint an opponent's vital areas, such as eyes, throat, and
 pressure points.\ Feat Path*: [Mantis Style],
 [Mantis Wisdom], [Mantis
 Torment].

**Marid Style**: Marid style emulates the fluid strength of
 flowing rivers and the cold of the ocean depths. Masters of the
 style can withstand severe cold, manipulate water to lash at
 enemies from afar, and freeze their foes in place.\ Feat Path*:
 [Marid Style], [Marid Spirit],
 [Marid Coldsnap].

**Monkey Style**: Renowned for its speed and agility, monkey
 style blends jumping strikes, rolling blows, and ground
 fighting into a continuous onslaught aimed at disorienting and
 damaging an opponent through superior mobility.\ Feat Path*:
 [Monkey Style], [Monkey Moves],
 [Monkey Shine].

**Panther Style**: Students of the panther throw caution to the
 wind as they weave recklessly among their foes. Those who
 master the style turn their unrivaled mobility into a weapon,
 striking their enemies with a series of swift retaliatory
 strikes.\ Feat Path*: [Panther Style], [Panther
 Claws], [Panther Parry].

**Shaitan Style**: Practitioners of this style imbue their fists
 with the mineral acids of the deep earth. Their forceful blows
 conjure forth caustic elements to dissolve and disable their
 enemies.\ Feat Path*: [Shaitan Style], [Shaitan
 Skin], [Shaitan
 Earthblast].

**Snake Style**: Snake style emphasizes quick, shifting
 movements. Its practitioners normally hold their hands flat
 with the fingers together to mimic the head of a snake. Able to
 strike when least expected, snake stylists are known for
 opportunism and blinding speed.\ Feat Path*: [Snake
 Style], [Snake Sidewinder],
 [Snake Fang].

**Snapping Turtle Style**: The snapping turtle style emphasizes
 active defense with one hand. Students of the style utilize a
 variety of locks, grabs, and circular blocks to protect
 themselves, as well as employing a debilitating clutch.\ Feat
 Path*: [Snapping Turtle Style],
 [Snapping Turtle Clutch], [Snapping
 Turtle Shell].

**Tiger Style**: This style seeks to emulate the power and fury
 of the great tiger. Practitioners use their hands like claws,
 perfecting overpowering double hand strikes and driving attack
 chains.\ Feat Path*: [Tiger Style], [Tiger
 Claws], [Tiger Pounce].


### [Teamwork Feats]

Teamwork grant significant bonuses but only function under
specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an
ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the
battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed
conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed,
stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for
the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have
special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats
even when their allies do not have the feats.

## Feat Descriptions

All the feat descriptions in this chapter utilize the following
format.

**Feat Name**: At the top of the feat entry, you will find the
  feat's name followed by parentheses listing any type or types
  the feat belongs to. A basic description of what the feat does
  appears under the name of the feat and its types, if any.

**Prerequisites**: This line lists any minimum ability scores,
  class features, feats, minimum base attack bonus, minimum
  number of ranks in one or more skills, or other requirements
  for a character to take the feat. This entry is absent if a
  feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have multiple
  prerequisites. See the feat descriptions for full details.

**Benefit**: The benefit is what a feat enables a character
  (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the
  same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless
  indicated in the feat's Special line.

**Normal**: This line indicates what a character without this
  feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the
  feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

**Special**: This line lists special features of the feat, such
  as, but not limited to, whether or not you can take the feat
  more than once, or whether the feat allows members of specific
  classes to gain additional benefits.

### Adder Strike (Combat) {#adder-strike}

You can quickly apply poison to gloved hands, protected feet, or
other protected body parts, delivering the poison with your
unarmed strikes.

**Prerequisites**: Poison use class feature, [Craft] (alchemy) 1
  rank, [Improved Unarmed Strike].

**Benefit**: As a swift action, you can apply one dose of contact
  or injury poison to two body parts that you use for unarmed
  strikes. You must still protect yourself against exposure to
  contact poisons you apply in this way.

**Normal**: Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of
  ammunition is a standard action.

### Adept Champion

You can alter your smite ability, channeling the power of your
deity into divine inspiration that grants you greater aptitude
for performing combat maneuvers.

**Prerequisites**: Smite evil class feature, base attack bonus
  +5.

**Benefit**: While using your smite evil class feature, as a
  swift action at the start of your turn, you can forgo the bonus
  on damage rolls and instead gain half that bonus as a bonus on
  combat maneuver checks against the target of your smite. The
  effects of your smite evil feature return to normal at the
  start of your next turn.

### Amateur Gunslinger (Combat) {#amateur-gunslinger}

Although you are not a gunslinger, you have and can use grit.

**Prerequisite**: You have no levels in a class that has the grit
  class feature.

**Benefit**: You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to
  perform a single 1st-level deed from the gunslinger deed class
  feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though
  throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of
  your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the
  rules for the gunslinger's grit class feature (see page 9). You
  can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose
  upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained
  through feats or magic items.

**Special**: If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit
  class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the
  [Extra Grit] feat.

### Arc Slinger (Combat) {#arc-slinger}

You can twirl your sling in a way that maximizes its
effectiveness.

**Prerequisites**: [Point-Blank Shot], proficient with sling or
  halfling sling staff.

**Benefit**: When using a sling or sling staff, you reduce your
  penalty on ranged attack rolls due to range by 2. [Point-Blank
  Shot]'s damage bonus applies within the first normal range
  increment of your sling (50 feet) or sling staff (80 feet).

### Back to Back (Teamwork) {#back-to-back}

Your ally's eyes are your own, and yours are his.

**Prerequisite**: [Perception] 3 ranks.

**Benefit**: While you are flanked and adjacent to an ally with
  this feat, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against
  attacks from opponents flanking you.

### Betrayer

You can charm people into lowering their defenses, allowing you
to ambush them more effectively.

**Prerequisites**: [Quick Draw], [Persuasive], base attack bonus
  +3.

**Benefit**: When you succeed at a [Diplomacy] check to change a
  creature's attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single
  melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If
  you changed your target's attitude to friendly or better, your
  target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If the
  target survives, it takes a –2 penalty on its initiative check
  for this combat.

Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.

### Binding Throw (Combat) {#binding-throw}

You can strike your enemy and use the blow as an opportunity to
grab and hold him.

**Prerequisites**: [Improved Grapple], [Improved Trip], [Improved
  Unarmed Strike], *Ki* Throw.

**Benefit**: After you successfully use the *Ki* Throw feat on an
  opponent, you can use a swift action to attempt a grapple
  combat maneuver against that opponent.

**Normal**: The grapple combat maneuver is a standard action.

**Special**: A monk can gain [Binding Throw] as a bonus feat
  starting at 14th level.

### Bludgeoner (Combat) {#bludgeoner}

You can knock foes out cold with just about any blunt instrument.

**Benefit**: You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a
  lethal bludgeoning weapon to deal nonlethal damage.

**Normal**: You take a –4 penalty on attack rolls when using a
  lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage. You cannot use a lethal
  weapon to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack.

**Special**: A rogue with this feat can use a lethal bludgeoning
  weapon to deal nonlethal damage with a sneak attack.

### Boar Ferocity (Combat) {#boar-ferocity}

Your flesh-ripping unarmed strikes terrify your victims.

**Prerequisites**: [Improved Unarmed Strike], Boar Style,
  [Intimidate] 6 ranks.

**Benefit**: You add piercing damage to the damage types you can
  deal with your unarmed strikes. Further, you gain a +2 bonus on
  [Intimidate] checks to demoralize opponents. While using Boar
  Style, whenever you tear an opponent's flesh, you can spend a
  free action to make an [Intimidate] check to demoralize that
  opponent.

### Boar Shred (Combat) {#boar-shred}

The wounds you inflict with your unarmed strikes bleed, giving
you renewed vigor.

**Prerequisites**: [Improved Unarmed Strike], [Boar Ferocity],
  Boar Style, [Intimidate] 9 ranks.

**Benefit**: You can make an [Intimidate] check to demoralize an
  opponent as a move action. While using Boar Style, whenever you
  tear an opponent's flesh, once per round at the start of that
  opponent's turn he takes 1d6 bleed damage. The bleed damage
  dealt while using Boar Style persist even if you later switch
  to a different style.

### Boar Style (Combat, Style) {#boar-style}

Your sharp teeth and nails rip your foes open.

**Prerequisites**: [Improved Unarmed Strike], [Intimidate] 3
  ranks.

**Benefit**: You can deal bludgeoning damage or slashing damage
  with your unarmed strikes—changing damage type is a free
  action. While using this style, once per round when you hit a
  single foe with two or more unarmed strikes, you can tear
  flesh. When you do, you deal 2d6 bleed damage with the attack.

### Body Shield (Combat) {#body-shield}

With a sly maneuver, you force a grappled opponent into the path
of an incoming attack.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [Improved Grapple], [Improved Unarmed
  Strike], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action while you are grappling an
  adjacent creature, you can make a grapple combat maneuver check
  against that creature to gain cover against a single attack. If
  you are successful and the attack misses you, that attack
  targets the creature you used as cover, using the same attack
  roll. You cannot use this feat against a creature grappling
  you, and the cover you gain ends after the attack you gained
  cover against is resolved.

### Bolstered Resilience

You can dramatically increase your damage reduction in exchange
for its temporary loss.

**Prerequisite**: Damage reduction.

**Benefit**: As an immediate action, you can double your DR
  against a single attack, to a maximum of DR 20. The type of the
  DR remains unchanged. If the attack you are guarding against is
  not successful, the increased damage reduction persists until
  you are hit with an attack or until the start of your next
  turn, whichever happens first. At the start of your next turn,
  you become fatigued. You cannot use this feat while you are
  fatigued.

### Bonebreaker (Combat) {#bonebreaker}

When your opponent is unable to adequately defend against them,
your precise unarmed strikes break bone and tear tissue.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [Improved Grapple], [Improved Unarmed
  Strike], [Jawbreaker], [Stunning Fist], [Heal] 9 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you make a successful [Stunning Fist] attempt
  against an opponent that is grappled, helpless, or stunned, you
  can forgo any other [Stunning Fist] effect to deal 1d6 Strength
  or Dexterity damage to that opponent.

### Branded for Retribution

You brand an enemy with your bane weapon, making it more
vulnerable to your allies' attacks.

**Prerequisite**: Bane class feature.

**Benefit**: As a standard action, expend 3 rounds of your bane
  class feature and make a melee touch attack with the weapon
  affected by bane. If you hit, your target takes no damage but
  is branded until the start of your next turn. While this brand
  remains, your allies' weapons are considered to have the bane
  ability with which your weapon is imbued when they attack the
  branded creature.

### Break Guard (Combat) {#break-guard}

You can use one of your two weapons to occupy your opponent's
defenses while attacking with the other.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 15, Int 13, [Combat Expertise], [Improved
  Disarm], [Two-Weapon Fighting].

**Benefit**: While wielding two weapons, whenever you
  successfully use one weapon to disarm an opponent, you can
  spend a swift action to attack the opponent you attempted to
  disarm using your other weapon.

### Broken Wing Gambit (Combat, Teamwork) {#broken-wing-gambit}

You feign weakness, making yourself a tempting and distracting
target.

**Prerequisite**: [Bluff] 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: Whenever you make a melee attack and hit your
  opponent, you can use a free action to grant that opponent a +2
  bonus on attack and damage rolls against you until the end of
  your next turn or until your opponent attacks you, whichever
  happens first. If that opponent attacks you with this bonus, it
  provokes attacks of opportunity from your allies who have this
  feat.

### Cartwheel [Dodge]

You use your knack for avoiding damage to reposition yourself in
combat.

**Prerequisites**: Evasion class feature, improved evasion class
  feature, acrobatics 12 ranks.

**Benefit**: When you successfully use improved evasion to avoid
  taking damage, you can move up to half your speed as an
  immediate action. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity
  as normal.

### Cavalry Formation (Combat, Teamwork) {#cavalry-formation}

You are skilled at riding in close formation with your mounted
allies without impeding your effectiveness on the battlefield.

**Prerequisite**: [Mounted Combat].

**Benefit**: You and your mount can overlap the space of mounts
  whose riders have this feat, although no more than two
  creatures can share any one square. Further, you can charge
  through a space containing an allied mount if that mount's
  rider has this feat, although the space from which you make
  your charge attack must comply with this feat's other benefit
  or be unoccupied.

### Channeled Revival

You can expend a large portion of your channeling power to
reverse death itself.

**Prerequisite**: Channel energy 6d6 (positive energy).

**Benefit**: As a full-round action that provokes attacks of
  opportunity, you can expend three uses of your channel energy
  class feature to restore a dead creature to life as if you had
  cast the *[breath of life]* spell (*Core Rulebook* 251).

### Channeling Scourge

Your zeal for hunting your faith's enemies empowers your ability
to channel divine energy, as long as you channel that energy for
harm.

**Prerequisite**: Inquisitor channel energy class feature.

**Benefit**: When you use channel energy to deal damage, your
  inquisitor levels count as cleric levels for determining the
  number of damage dice and the saving throw DC.

### Charging Hurler (Combat) {#charging-hurler}

You know how to use your momentum to enhance your thrown weapon
attacks.

**Prerequisite**: [Point-Blank Shot].

**Benefit**: You can use the charge rules to make a thrown weapon
  attack. All the parameters of a charge apply, except that you
  must only move closer to your opponent, and you must end your
  movement within 30 feet of that opponent. If you do, you can
  make a single thrown weapon attack against that opponent,
  gaining the +2 bonus on the attack roll and taking a –2 penalty

  maneuver with a –5 penalty on the check. If you succeed, you
  have pinned your opponent and hold the opponent in a
  chokehold. When you maintain the grapple, you also maintain the
  chokehold. A creature in a chokehold cannot breathe or speak,
  and thus cannot cast spells that have a verbal component. An
  opponent you have in a chokehold has to hold his breath or
  begin suffocating. Any creature that does not breathe, is
  immune to bleed damage, or is immune to critical hits is immune

  expend one of your daily uses of channel energy to create a
  repository of positive energy within that ally. This repository

  channel energy feature, and it lasts for 1 minute. An ally who
  has such a repository can use an immediate action to roll the
  repository's dice and regain a number of hit points equal to

  weapon attack that would normally hit you. You expend no action

Your attacks don't just fell your opponents—they kill them
outright.

  capable of holding the object you offer, and it must have one
  such appendage free to take the object.

**Special**: An alchemist who has the delayed bomb alchemist
  discovery can use this feat to hand an enemy a delayed
  bomb. Such a delayed bomb detonates at the end of the
  alchemist's turn. If the bomb is in a creature's square at the

  Unarmed Strike], [Acrobatics] 6 ranks.

**Normal**: You can trip only those opponents that are one size
  category larger than you.

### Efreeti Stance (Combat) {#efreeti-stance}

  Fist\*\*, [Improved Unarmed Strike], base attack bonus +11 or
  monk level 9th.

  Player's Guide* 158) attempt per day. While using Efreeti
  Style, you gain fire resistance equal to your base attack bonus
  or your monk level plus any base attack bonus gained from
  levels in classes other than monk, whichever is higher. While
  denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this
  resistance. Creatures that take fire damage from your
  [Elemental Fist] attack must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 10 +
  1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) or catch on fire.

### Efreeti Style (Combat, Style) {#efreeti-style}

Your mastery of the unpredictable power of flames allows you to
unleash scorching strikes that burn your enemies even when you
fail to make contact.

**Prerequisites**: Con 13, Wis 15, Elemental Fist\*\*, [Improved
  Unarmed Strike], base attack bonus +9 or monk level 5th.

  and [Elemental Fist] to deal fire damage, you gain a bonus on
  fire damage rolls equal to your Wisdom bonus. Further, if your
  [Elemental Fist] melee attack misses while you are using it to
  deal fire damage, you still deal 1d6 points of fire damage to
  your target.

### Efreeti Touch (Combat) {#efreeti-touch}

Your knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun
allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in
a gout of elemental fire.

**Prerequisites**: Con 15, Wis 17, Efreeti Style, [Efreeti
  Stance], Elemental Fist\*\*, [Improved Unarmed Strike], base
  attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th.

**Benefit**: While using Efreeti Style, as a standard action, you
  can spend two [Elemental Fist] (*Advanced Player's Guide* 158)
  attempts to unleash a 15-foot cone-shaped burst of
  flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike
  damage plus the fire damage from your [Elemental Fist] and
  catch on fire. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your
  character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half
  and prevents a target from catching on fire.

### Elusive Redirection

You can redirect an attack back at your assailant or into an
adjacent enemy.

**Prerequisites**: Elusive target class feature, [Combat
  Expertise], [Improved Unarmed Strike], flowing monk level 12th.

### Expert Driver

When driving a chosen type of vehicle, you exhibit incredible
control, maneuvering the vehicle with greater ease and stopping
with uncanny precision.

**Prerequisite**: [Skilled Driver] with the selected vehicle
  type.

**Benefit**: You can make an accelerate, decelerate, or turn
  action as a move action instead of a standard
  action. Furthermore, when stopping a vehicle, you subtract 10
  feet from the roll to determine how many feet the vehicle moves
  forward before it stops.

### Extra Bane

You can use your bane ability more often than normal.

**Prerequisite**: Bane class feature.

**Benefit**: You can use your bane ability for 3 additional
  rounds per day.

### Extra Grit (Grit) {#extra-grit}

You have more grit than the ordinary gunslinger.

**Prerequisites**: Grit class feature or the [Amateur Gunslinger]
  feat.

**Benefit**: You gain 2 extra grit points at the start of each
  day, and your maximum grit increases by 2.

**Normal**: If you are a gunslinger, you gain your Wisdom
  modifier in grit points at the start of each day, which is also
  your maximum grit. If you have the [Amateur Gunslinger] feat,
  you gain 1 grit point at the start of each day, and your
  maximum grit is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

**Special**: If you possess levels in the gunslinger class, you
  can take this feat multiple times.

opponent into thinking he has an opening.

  make a ranged attack using that weapon, you can choose to
  provoke an attack of opportunity from one or more opponents who
  threaten you. You gain a +4 dodge bonus against such
  attacks. An opponent that makes such an attack and misses you
  loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against you until the end of
  your turn.

### Feint Partner (Combat, Teamwork) {#feint-partner}

A little diversion is all you need to slip through your foe's
defenses.

**Prerequisite**: [Bluff] 1 rank.

**Benefit**: Whenever an ally who also has this feat successfully
  feints an opponent, that opponent also loses his Dexterity
  bonus to AC against the next attack you make against him before
  the end of the feinting ally's next turn.

### Felling Escape (Combat) {#felling-escape}

Through the use of fluid contortions and manipulations of
leverage, you can throw your opponent to the ground after
escaping a grapple.

  as effects that augment an unarmed strike.

**Special**: If you are a monk, you can use the selected natural
  weapon with your flurry of blows class feature.

### Field Repair

You can repair your broken weapon or armor to serviceability even
without the benefits of artisan tools.

**Prerequisite**: [Craft] 4 ranks.

**Benefit**: If you are trained in a [Craft] skill appropriate to
  a broken item, you can repair that item with no raw material
  cost and no penalty on your [Craft] skill check for using
  improvised tools. If you spend a day, the item regains 1 hit
  point plus one-quarter of its original hit
  points. Alternatively, if the item gained the broken condition
  because it is a firearm that has misfired or a siege engine
  that suffered a mishap, or has the broken condition because it
  has the fragile weapon quality (or some similar quality), you
  can make a [Craft] check with the DC it takes to craft that
  item (see Table 2–2, below). If the check succeeds, the item
  loses the broken condition.

**Normal**: Improvised tools impose a –2 penalty on [Craft]
  checks. Items require raw materials to repair.

  Item                            Craft Skill     Craft DC
  ------------------------------- --------------- --------------
  A weapon with the fragile       Weapon or Bow   Normal DC –5

Your coils are particularly deadly, allowing you to constrict
opponents of your size or smaller.

**Prerequisites**: Str 13, Int 3; naga, serpentfolk, or creature
  that has the constrict special attack; base attack bonus +3.

**Benefit**: You gain the constrict and grab special
  attacks. Your constrict attack deals damage equal to your
  unarmed strike or primary natural weapon melee attack. Further,

  than you.

  flanking you and cannot deal sneak attack damage to you. It can
  still provide a flank for its allies.

### Fortified Armor Training (Combat) {#fortified-armor-training}

You have learned to let your armor bear the brunt of the worst
attacks.

**Prerequisite**: Proficient with armor or shield.

**Benefit**: If an opponent scores a critical hit against you,
  you can turn the critical hit into a normal hit. If you do,
  either your armor or your shield gains the broken condition
  (your choice).

### Furious Finish

You channel all of your rage into one massive blow to crush your
enemy.

**Prerequisites**: Rage class feature, [Vital Strike], base
  attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: While raging, when you use the [Vital Strike] feat,
  you can choose not to roll your damage dice and instead deal
  damage equal to the maximum roll possible on those damage
  dice. If you do, your rage immediately ends, and you are
  fatigued (even if you would not normally be).

### Gory Finish (Combat) {#gory-finish}

By drawing upon wells of savagery, you can slay your foe in
creative and horrifyingly gruesome manners, intimidating nearby
foes.

**Prerequisites**: [Dazzling Display], [Weapon Focus].

**Benefit**: When you use the attack action, you can use a weapon
  with which you have [Weapon Focus] to make a single attack at
  your highest base attack bonus. If you reduce your target to

  [Intimidate] check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who
  could see your attack.

### Greater Channel Smite

You empower your weapon with the might of your deity, which you
discharge as you strike your foes.

**Prerequisites**: Channel energy class feature, [Channel Smite],
  base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit**: Before making any melee attacks on your turn, you
  can use a swift action to expend one daily use of your channel
  energy class feature. The dice from your channel energy feature
  form a pool of damage dice you can access to further damage
  creatures normally harmed by the energy you are
  channeling—undead for positive energy, living creatures for
  negative energy. Prior to making each melee attack, allocate
  dice from the pool to be used as extra damage dice if you
  hit. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this
  extra damage. This extra damage is not multiplied when you
  score a critical hit. If you miss, the extra damage dice remain
  in your pool, but any dice left unexpended at the end of your
  turn are wasted.

### Greater Rending Fury (Combat) {#greater-rending-fury}

  bonus +16, and to +6 when you have base attack bonus +20.

### Greater Whip Mastery (Combat) {#greater-whip-mastery}

You can use a whip to make combat maneuvers with ease.

**Prerequisites**: [Improved Whip Mastery], [Weapon Focus]
  (whip), [Whip Mastery], base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit**: You are so quick with your whip that you never drop
  it due to a failed disarm or trip combat maneuver
  attempt. Further, you gain the ability to grapple using your
  whip. To do so, use the normal grapple rules with the following
  changes.

*Attack*: You cannot use your whip to attack while you are using
 it to grapple an opponent.

*Damage*: When dealing damage to your grappled opponent, you deal
 your whip's weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike
 damage.

*Free Hands*: You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check
 for having fewer than two hands free when you use your whip to
 grapple.

*Reach*: Rather than pulling your grappled opponent adjacent to
 you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple,
 you must keep him within your whip's reach minus his own reach
 to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than
 0, such as is the case for a Medium whip wielder and a
 Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your
 whip. If you have to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple
 it with your whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity
 from that opponent unless you have the [Improved Grapple] feat.

*Tie Up*: While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use
 your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have
 grappled rather than pinned, you take only a –5 penalty on the
 combat maneuver check rather than the normal –10.

### Guided Hand

Your deity blesses any strike you make with that deity's favored
weapon.

**Prerequisites**: Channel energy class feature, [Channel Smite],
  proficiency with your deity's favored weapon.

**Benefit**: With your deity's favored weapon, you can use your
  Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
  on attack rolls.

### Gunsmithing

**Benefit**: If you have access to a gunsmith's kit, you can
  create and restore firearms, craft bullets, and mix black
  powder for all types of firearms. You do not need to make a
  [Craft] check to create firearms and ammunition or to restore
  firearms.

*Crafting Firearms*: You can craft any early firearm for a cost
 in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. At your
 GM's discretion, you can craft advanced firearms for a cost in
 raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. Crafting a
 firearm in this way takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of
 the firearm's price (minimum 1 day).

*Crafting Ammunition*: You can craft bullets, pellets, and black
 powder for a cost in raw materials equal to 10% of the price. If
 you have at least 1 rank in [Craft] (alchemy), you can craft
 alchemical cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half
 the price of the cartridge. At your GM's discretion, you can
 craft metal cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half
 the cost of the cartridge. Crafting bullets, black powder, or
 cartridges takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of ammunition
 (minimum 1 day).

*Restoring a Broken Firearm*: Each day, with an hour's worth of
 work, you can use this feat to repair a single firearm with the
 broken condition. You can take time during a rest period to
 restore a broken firearm with this feat.

**Special**: If you are a gunslinger, this feat grants the
  following additional benefit. You can use this feat to repair
  and restore your initial, battered weapon. It costs 300 gp and
  1 day of work to upgrade it to a masterwork firearm of its
  type.

### Hammer the Gap (Combat) {#hammer-the-gap}

You repeatedly strike the same location, causing increasing
amounts of damage.

**Prerequisite**: Base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit**: When you take a full-attack action, each consecutive
  hit against the same opponent deals extra damage equal to the
  number of previous consecutive hits you have made against that
  opponent this turn. This damage is multiplied on a critical
  hit.

### Harmonic Sage

Your thorough understanding of acoustics in artificial
surroundings allows you to improve the power of your bardic
performance.

**Prerequisites**: Bardic performance class feature, [Knowledge]
  (engineering) 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: While inside an artificial structure, you can spend
  a free action to make a DC 15 [Knowledge] (engineering) check
  when you begin your bardic performance. Success on this check
  allows you to do one of the following.

*Self-Harmonize:* By performing over the acoustic reverberations
 of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic
 performance effects +1.

*Reverberation:* You can choose to have the effect of your
 current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease
 maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You
 can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at
 one time.

**Normal**: A bardic performance lasts only as long as you

  Gnome], [Knowledge] (arcana) 3 ranks.

**Benefit**: You gain one use of your gnome magic that is
  independent of your gnome magic spell-like abilities. When you
  wish to cast a gnome magic spell-like ability for which you
  have no daily uses remaining, you can expend this independent
  use to do so.

Further, while you are under the effect of *[haunted fey aspect]*
(page 230)*,* you can discharge that spell as a free action after
you hit an opponent with a charge attack or score a critical hit
against an opponent. If you do, that opponent becomes shaken for
1 round.

### Haunted Gnome Shroud (Combat) {#haunted-gnome-shroud}

Your disturbing glamer expands to make your exact location hard
to pinpoint.

  use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a
  successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to
  dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action
  to deliver the effects of the chosen hex to that
  opponent. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you
  take it, you apply it to a different qualifying hex.

   {#impact-critical-shot}

With a series of ranged attacks, you bring your foes to their
knees or force them to move.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 13, [Point-Blank Shot], base attack bonus
  +9.

**Benefit**: Whenever you score a critical hit with a ranged
  attack, in addition to the normal damage your attack deals, if
  your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you can
  push your opponent back as if from the bull rush combat
  maneuver or knock that target prone as if from a trip combat
  maneuver. If you choose to bull rush, you cannot move with the
  target. Your maneuver does not provoke an attack of
  opportunity.

**Normal**: You must perform a bull rush combat maneuver to bull
  rush an opponent, and you must perform a trip combat maneuver
  to trip an opponent.

### Impaling Critical (Combat, Critical) {#impaling-critical}

**Benefit**: Whenever you score a critical hit with the selected
  piercing melee weapon, you can impale your opponent on your
  weapon. While your opponent is impaled in this way, each time
  he starts his turn, you deal damage equal to your weapon's
  damage dice plus the extra damage dice from your weapon's
  properties. As an immediate action, you can pull your weapon
  out of your opponent. If your opponent is ever outside your
  reach, you must spend a free action to let go of your weapon or
  pull it out of him. Your opponent can also spend a move action
  to pull your weapon out. When the weapon comes out, your
  opponent takes damage as if starting his turn impaled. While
  you impale your opponent with your weapon, you cannot use it to
  attack, and you must hold on to it.

### Improved Back to Back (Teamwork) {#improved-back-to-back}

After much practice, you and an ally have become adept at
fighting in close proximity to one another.

**Prerequisites**: [Back to Back], [Perception] 5 ranks.

**Prerequisites**: Impaling Critical, [Critical Focus], [Weapon
  Specialization] with selected piercing melee weapon, base

**Benefit**: While you are using Impaling Critical to impale an
  opponent, and you are still holding onto that weapon, that
  opponent must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check
  against you to pull your weapon out. If you have let go of your
  weapon, the impaled opponent must spend a standard action to
  remove the weapon. Until the opponent pulls the weapon out, his
  speed in all modes is halved and his maneuverability, if any,
  is reduced by one step. When the weapon comes out, instead of
  dealing the damage normal for Impaling Critical, you can deal
  bleed damage equal to your weapon's damage dice result once per
  round at the start of that opponent's turn.

### Improved Rending Fury (Combat) {#improved-rending-fury}
