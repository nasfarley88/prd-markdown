# Feats

Feats represent a special trick or ability a character has
acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her
birth. They grant characters abilities others lack, giving them
an edge in the right situation. While some specifically interact
with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets
the prerequisites. The feats in this book expand upon those in
the *PF Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook,*including a host
of new combat feats and metamagic feats. In addition, this
chapter also introduces teamwork feats, which function only when
two characters with the same feat work together.

## Types of Feats


While most of the feats presented here are general, and have no
special rules governing them, some feats have a category
associated with them that involves special rules. This category
is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can
be found in this chapter.

### Combat Feats

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a
fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict
characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming
they meet the prerequisites.

### [Metamagic Feats]

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their
spells, granting them new powers and effects. Such spells
generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal
spell.

### [Teamwork Feats]

Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under
specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an
ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on
the battlefield.  Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed
conditions are not met.  Note that allies who are paralyzed,
stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for
the purposes of these feats.

## Feat Descriptions

Feats are summarized on the table below. Note that the
prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are
abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' description for
full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

**Feat Name**: The feat's name also indicates what subcategory,
if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic
description of what the feat does.

**Prerequisite**: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats,
a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or
more skills, or anything else required in order to take the
feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat
may have more than one prerequisite.

**Benefit**: What a feat enables the character (“you” in the feat
description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than
once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the
description.

**Normal**: What a character who does not have this feat is
limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat
causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

**Special**: Additional unusual facts about the feat.

\* This is a combat feat and can be selected as a fighter bonus

### Additional Traits


You have more traits than normal.

**Benefit:** You gain two character traits of your choice (see
Chapter 8). These traits must be chosen from different lists, and
cannot be chosen from lists from which you have already selected
a character trait. You must meet any additional qualifications
for the character traits you choose.

### Allied Spellcaster (Teamwork) {#allied-spellcaster}


With the aid of an ally, you are skilled at piercing the
protections of other creatures with your spells.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on level checks made
to overcome spell resistance. If your ally has the same spell
prepared (or known with a slot available if they are spontaneous
spellcasters), this bonus increases to +4 and you receive a +1
bonus to the caster level for all level-dependent variables, such
as duration, range, and effect.

### Arcane Blast


You can convert any spell into an attack.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can sacrifice a prepared
spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform
it into a ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of damage plus an additional
1d6 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot
you sacrificed. 0-level spells may not be sacrificed in this
manner.

### Arcane Shield


You can convert any spell into a defense.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As a immediate action, you can sacrifice a prepared
spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and gain a
deflection bonus to AC equal to the level of the spell or spell
slot you sacrificed for 1 round. 0-level spells may not be
sacrificed in this manner.

### Arcane Talent


Magic is in your blood, and at your fingertips.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 10; elf, half-elf, or gnome.

**Benefit:** Choose a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard
spell list.  You can cast this spell three times per day as a
spell-like ability. The caster level is equal to your character
level. The save DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier.

### Aspect of the Beast


Whether by magic or a curse of your blood, some part of you is
more beast than man.

**Prerequisite:** wild shape class feature, see Special.

**Benefit:** Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the
following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the
feat, and then you cannot change it.

*Night Senses (Ex)*: If your base race has normal vision, you
gain low-light vision. If your base race has low-light vision,
you gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If your base race
has darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30
feet.

*Claws of the Beast (Ex)*: You grow a pair of claws. These claws
lare primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you
are Small).

*Predator's Leap (Ex)*: You can make a running jump without
needing to run 10 feet before you jump.

*Wild Instinct (Ex)*: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks
and a +2 bonus on [Survival] skill checks.

**Special:** A character that has contracted lycanthropy can take
this feat without having to meet the prerequisites. A ranger who
selects the natural weapon combat style can take this feat
without having to meet the prerequisites (even if he does not
select [Aspect of the Beast] as a bonus feat).

### Bashing Finish (Combat) {#bashing-finish}


You follow a powerful blow from your weapon with an opportunistic
bash from your shield.

**Prerequisites:** [Improved Shield Bash], [Shield Master],
  [Two-Weapon Fighting], base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
weapon, you can make a shield bash attack against the same target
using the same bonus as a free action.

### Bloody Assault (Combat) {#bloody-assault}


Sacrificing accuracy, you can inflict bloody wounds that are slow
to heal.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Power Attack], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee
attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to inflict 1d4 points of
bleed damage with your weapon melee attacks, in addition to the
normal damage dealt by the weapon. A creature continues to take
bleed damage every round at the start of its turn. Bleed damage
can be stopped by a DC 15 [Heal] check or through any magical
healing.  Bleed damage from this feat does not stack with
itself. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack
roll, and its effects last until your next turn (although the
bleeding lasts until healed, as normal).

### Bodyguard (Combat) {#bodyguard}


Your swift strikes ward off enemies attacking nearby allies.

**Prerequisite:** [Combat Reflexes].

**Benefit:** When an adjacent ally is attacked, you may use an
attack of opportunity to attempt the aid another action to
improve your ally's AC.  You may not use the aid another action
to improve your ally's attack roll with this attack.

**Normal:** Aid another is a standard action.

### Bouncing Spell (Metamagic) {#bouncing-spell}


You can direct a failed spell against a different target.

**Benefit:** Whenever a bouncing spell targeting a single
creature has no effect on its intended target (whether due to
spell resistance or a successful saving throw) you may, as a
swift action, redirect it to target another eligible creature
within range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its
new target were the original target for the spell. Spells that
affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a
successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner. A
bouncing spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the
spell's actual level.

### Breadth of Experience


Although still young for your kind, you have a lifetime of
knowledge and training.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf, elf, or gnome; 100+ years old.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on all [Knowledge] and
[Profession] skill checks, and can make checks with those skills
untrained.

### Bull Rush Strike (Combat) {#bull-rush-strike}


Your critical hits can push back your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Improved Bull Rush], [Power Attack],
  base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
attack, you can push your opponent back, in addition to the
normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll
exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may push your opponent back as
if from the bull rush combat maneuver.  You do not need to move
with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of
opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a bull rush combat maneuver to bull
rush an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the
following feats to a given critical hit: [Bull Rush Strike],
[Disarming Strike], [Repositioning Strike], [Sundering Strike],
or [Tripping Strike]. You may choose to use this feat after you
make your confirmation roll.

### Charge Through (Combat) {#charge-through}


You can overrun enemies when charging.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Improved Overrun], [Power Attack],
  base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When making a charge, you can attempt to overrun one
creature in the path of the charge as a free action. If you
successfully overrun that creature, you can complete the
charge. If the overrun is unsuccessful, the charge ends in the
space directly in front of that creature.

**Normal:** You must have a clear path toward the target of your
  charge.

### Childlike


Your resemblance to a human child tends to make others trust you,
perhaps more than they should.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, halfling.

**Benefit:** You can take 10 on [Bluff] checks to convince others
you are telling the truth, so long as your story makes you appear
innocent. You gain a +2 bonus on [Disguise] skill checks to pose
as a human child, and ignore the check penalties for disguising
yourself as a different race and age category while doing so.

### Cloud Step


Your tread is of unearthly lightness.

**Prerequisites:** [Spider Step], monk level 12th.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can *[air walk]* (as the
spell) up to half your slow fall distance, maximum 50 feet. You
must reach a solid, level surface by the end of your turn or you
will fall.

### Cockatrice Strike (Combat) {#cockatrice-strike}


With a single strike, you transmute flesh to stone.

**Prerequisites:** [Improved Unarmed Strike], [Gorgon's Fist],
  [Medusa's Wrath], base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you can make a single
unarmed strike against a dazed, flat-footed, paralyzed,
staggered, stunned, or unconscious foe. If that attack is a
critical hit, the target is petrified unless it succeeds on a
Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level
+ your Wisdom modifier. This is a supernatural polymorph effect.

### Combat Patrol (Combat) {#combat-patrol}


You range across the battlefield, dealing with threats wherever
they arise.

**Prerequisites:** [Combat Reflexes], [Mobility], base attack
bonus +5.

**Benefit:** As a full-round action, you may set up a combat
patrol, increasing your threatened area by 5 feet for every 5
points of your base attack bonus. Until the beginning of your
next turn, you may make attacks of opportunity against any
opponent in this threatened area that provokes attacks of
opportunity. You may move as part of these attacks, provided your
total movement before your next turn does not exceed your
speed. Any movement you make provokes attacks of opportunity as
normal.

### Cooperative Crafting


Your assistance makes item crafting far more efficient.

**Prerequisites:** 1 rank in any [Craft] skill, any item creation
feat.

**Benefit:** You can assist another character in crafting mundane
and magical items. You must both possess the relevant [Craft]
skill or item creation feat, but either one of you can fulfill
any other prerequisites for crafting the item. You provide a +2
circumstance bonus on any [Craft] or [Spellcraft] checks related
to making an item, and your assistance doubles the gp value of
items that can be crafted each day.

### Coordinated Defense (Combat, Teamwork) {#coordinated-defense}


You are adept at working with allies to avoid being tripped,
grappled, and subjected to other maneuvers.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus to your Combat
Maneuver Defense.  This bonus increases to +4 if the creature
attempting the maneuver is larger than both you and your ally.

### Coordinated Maneuvers (Combat, Teamwork) {#coordinated-maneuvers}


You are skilled at working with your allies to perform dangerous
combat maneuvers.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on all combat
maneuver checks.  This bonus increases to +4 when attempting to
break free from a grapple.

### Cosmopolitan


Living in large, exotic cities has put you in touch with many
diverse civilizations, cultures, and races.

**Benefit:** You can speak and read two additional languages of
your choice. In addition, choose two Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or
Charisma-based skills. Those skills always count as class skills
for you.

### Covering Defense (Combat) {#covering-defense}


You are skilled at protecting yourself and your allies with your
shield.

**Prerequisites:** [Shield Focus], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When you use the total defense action while using a
light, heavy, or tower shield, you can provide a cover bonus to
AC against all attacks to an adjacent ally your size or
smaller. This cover bonus is equal to your shield's shield bonus
and lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Your shield does
not provide a cover bonus to Reflex saves.

### Crippling Critical (Combat) {#crippling-critical}


You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.

**Prerequisites:** [Critical Focus], base attack bonus +13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit against an
opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful
Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of
this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against
creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which
movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack
must make a DC 10 [Fly] check to remain airborne, and has its
maneuverability reduced by one step.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one critical feat
to a given critical hit unless you possess [Critical Mastery].

### Crossbow Mastery (Combat) {#crossbow-mastery}


You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in

  [Rapid Shot].

**Benefit:** The time required for you to reload any type of
crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of
crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full
attack action as you could attack if you were using a
bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when
you took [Rapid Reload] no longer provokes attacks of
opportunity.

**Special:** Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery
combat style may select [Crossbow Mastery] as a combat style
feat.

### Dastardly Finish (Combat) {#dastardly-finish}


You can take advantage of an enemy's debilitated state to attempt

bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack
roll, and its effects last until your next turn.

### Dazing Spell (Metamagic) {#dazing-spell}


You can daze creatures with the power of your spells.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by
the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they
become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level
of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful
save negates the daze effect.  If the spell does not allow a
save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze
effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become
dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the
duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three
levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not
inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

### Deep Drinker


You draw greater amounts of *ki* from your libations.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, monk level 11, drunken *ki* class
  feature.

  base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
attack, you can disarm your opponent, in addition to the normal
damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds
your opponent's CMD, you may disarm your opponent as if from the
disarm combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of
opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a disarm combat maneuver to disarm
an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the
following feats to a given critical hit: [Bull Rush Strike],
[Disarming Strike], [Repositioning Strike], [Sundering Strike],
or [Tripping Strike]. You may choose to use this feat after you
make your confirmation roll.

a spell within 30 feet and successfully hit that opponent with a
ranged attack, the concentration DC to successfully cast the

Your magical energies cling to enemies, interfering with their
spellcasting.

**Benefit:** Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make
concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities
(DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of
the spell being cast) for 1 round. Targets that avoid the spell's
effects avoid this feat's effect as well. A disruptive spell uses
up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

### Diviner's Delving


Your keen magical intuition makes reading signs, portents, and
mystical clues quick and easy.

**Prerequisite:** [Spell Focus] (divination).

**Benefit:** You gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks with
divinations to overcome spell resistance or effects that impede
divination (for example, *[nondetection]*).  When using a
divination spell that requires concentration, you gain
information from the spell 1 round sooner than normal (so you
gain information from the first 2 rounds with 1 round of
concentration, and information from the third round in the second
round of concentration).

### Dreadful Carnage (Combat) {#dreadful-carnage}


Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, [Power Attack], [Furious Focus], base
attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit
points, you can make an [Intimidate] check to demoralize all
enemies within 30 feet as a free action. Enemies that cannot see
both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are
unaffected.

### Duck and Cover (Teamwork) {#duck-and-cover}


Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, and both of you are required to make a Reflex saving
throw against a spell or effect, you may take the result of your
die roll or that of your ally (your modifiers still apply to the
roll, regardless of which result you take). If you take your
ally's result, you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next

attacks as long as your ally is wielding a shield.

### Ectoplasmic Spell (Metamagic) {#ectoplasmic-spell}


Your spells breach the gulf between dimensions, sending ghostly
emanations into the ether.

**Benefit:** An ectoplasmic spell has full effect against
incorporeal or ethereal creatures. An ectoplasmic spell uses up a
spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

### Eldritch Claws (Combat) {#eldritch-claws}


Who needs magic weapons? Eldritch tricks are no match for your
bestial ferocity.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, natural weapons, base attack bonus +6.

following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. On a
successful hit, the attack deals damage normally plus 1d6 points
of damage of the chosen type. You must declare that you are using
this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack
roll ruins the attempt). You may attempt an elemental fist attack
once per day for every four levels you have attained (see
Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A monk of the four winds receives [Elemental Fist]
as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the

fire.  You may replace a spell's normal damage with that energy
type or split the spell's damage, so that half is of that energy
type and half is of its normal type. An elemental spell uses up a
spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you
must choose a different energy type.

### Elven Accuracy (Combat) {#elven-accuracy}


Your sharp eyesight makes difficult shots easier.

dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If your hit
points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit

Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the
spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

### Following Step (Combat) {#following-step}


You can repeatedly close the distance when foes try to move away,
without impeding your normal movement.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Step Up].

**Benefit:** When using the [Step Up] feat to follow an adjacent
foe, you may move up to 10 feet. You may still take a 5-foot step

using [Step Up].

**Prerequisites:** [Perception] 15 ranks, Improved [Blind-Fight].

**Benefit:** Your melee attacks ignore the miss chance for less
than total concealment, and you treat opponents with total
concealment as if they had normal concealment (20% miss chance
instead of 50%). You may still reroll a miss chance percentile
roll as normal.

If you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker,
that attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with
ranged attacks, regardless of the range. That is, you don't lose
your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get
the usual +2 bonus for being invisible.

**Special:** The Greater [Blind-Fight] feat is of no use against
a character who is the subject of a *[blink]* spell.

type of shield.

+8.

**Benefit:** Once per day as an immediate action you can delay
the onset of one harmful condition or affliction (such as
panicked, paralyzed, stunned, and so on), including permanent and

time the condition takes its normal effect.  This feat has no
effect on hit point damage or ability damage.

**Prerequisites:** [Diehard], [Endurance], base Fortitude save
+4.

**Benefit:** Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a
new saving throw against a harmful condition or affliction
requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you. If this save
against the affliction fails, there is no additional effect, but

poison or disease. You cannot use this feat to recover from
instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw,
or effects that do not require a Fortitude save.

target into any square you threaten that is occupied by another
creature. Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a -4
penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the
thrown creature lands prone in the secondary target's square,
while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked prone in an
adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands

secondary target.

with.

ability) you cast on yourself can also affect a creature bonded
to you (such as an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or
special mount). The creature must be within 5 feet of you at the
time of casting to receive the benefit. The spell's duration is
halved between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell
with a duration of 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both
you and your bonded creature).

If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous,
it stops affecting the creature if it moves farther than 5 feet
away from you. It does not affect the creature again if it
returns before the duration expires.

You may share spells in this fashion even if the spells normally
do not affect creatures of that type.

This feat only applies to animal companions, eidolons, familiars,
or special mounts gained through a class feature.

notice unusual stonework. This bonus replaces the stonecunning
ability's normal bonus on [Perception] checks.

### Intensified Spell (Metamagic) {#intensified-spell}


Your spells can go beyond several normal limitations.

**Benefit:** An intensified spell increases the maximum number of
damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster
levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this
feat. No other variables of the spell are affected, and spells
that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not
affected by this feat. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot
one level higher than the spell's actual level.

### In Harm's Way (Combat)


You put yourself in danger's path to save your allies.

**Prerequisite:** [Bodyguard].

**Benefit:** While using the aid another action to improve an
adjacent ally's AC, you can intercept a successful attack against

**Benefit:** You gain the scent special ability.

### Ki Throw (Combat) {#ki-throw}


Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw
enemies.

**Prerequisites:** [Improved Trip], [Improved Unarmed Strike].

**Benefit:** On a successful unarmed trip attack against a target
your size or smaller, you may throw the target prone in any
square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement
does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the
creature into a space occupied by other creatures.

**Special:** A monk may gain *Ki* Throw as a bonus feat at 10th
level. A monk with this feat can affect creatures larger than his
own size by spending 1 *ki* point per size category difference.

### Leaf Singer


Your songs recount the ways and mysteries of your people.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, bardic performance class feature, elf
or half-elf.

uneven terrain.

**Benefit:** The bonuses and penalties from your bardic
performance continue for 2 rounds after you cease performing. Any
other requirement, such as range or specific conditions, must

bardic performance during this time, the effects of the previous
performance immediately cease.

### Lingering Spell (Metamagic) {#lingering-spell}


You spell clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.

**Benefit:** You may cause an instantaneous spell that affects an
area to persist until the beginning of your next turn. Those
already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other
creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its
effects. A lingering spell with a visual manifestation obscures
vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and
total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet.

A lingering spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the
spell's actual level.

### Lookout (Combat, Teamwork) {#lookout}


Your allies help you avoid being surprised.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you may act in the surprise round as long as your ally
would normally be able to act in the surprise round. If you would
normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise round, your
initiative is equal to your initiative roll or the roll of your
ally -1, whichever is lower. If both you and your ally would be
able to act in the surprise round without the aid of this feat,
you may take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round
action) during the surprise round.

### Low Profile (Combat) {#low-profile}


Yours small stature helps you avoid ranged attacks.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against ranged
attacks. In addition, you do not provide soft cover to creatures
when ranged attacks pass through your square.

### Lucky Halfling


You bring luck to those with whom you travel.

**Prerequisite:** Halfling.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when one of your allies within 30 feet
makes a saving throw, you may roll the same saving throw as if
you were the one subject to the effect requiring it. You may use
this ability after your ally has rolled, but before the GM
declares if the roll was a success or failure. Your ally may
choose to use your saving throw in place of his own.

### Major Spell Expertise


You can cast a single low-level spell as a spell-like ability.

**Prerequisites:** [Minor Spell Expertise], ability to cast
9th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one spell that you know of 5th level or
lower. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like
ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to
your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is
taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the
spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be
chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this
spell.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
spell.

### Master Alchemist


Your mastery of alchemy is nearly supernatural.

**Prerequisite:** [Craft] (alchemy) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on [Craft] (alchemy) checks,
and you may create mundane alchemical items much more quickly
than normal. When making poisons, you can create a number of
doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one
time. These additional doses do not increase the time required,
but they do increase the raw material cost.

In addition, whenever you make alchemical items or poisons using
[Craft] (alchemy), use the item's gp value as its sp value when
determining your progress (do not multiply the item's gp cost by
10 to determine its sp cost).

### Merciful Spell (Metamagic) {#merciful-spell}


Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill.

**Benefit:** You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict
nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a
particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that
same type. A merciful spell does not use up a higher-level spell
slot than the spell's actual level.

### Minor Spell Expertise


You are able to cast a 1st-level spell as a spell-like ability.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 4th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one 1st-level spell that you know. You may
cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster
level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level
in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The
spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has
an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen
for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
spell.

### Missile Shield (Combat) {#missile-shield}


You are skilled at deflecting ranged attacks with your shield.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Shield Focus].

**Benefit:** You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to
use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with
an attack from a ranged weapon (not including spell effects,
natural attacks, or massive ranged weapons), you may deflect it
so that you take no damage, as if you had the [Deflect Arrows]
feat.  You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.

### Mounted Shield (Combat) {#mounted-shield}


Your defensive tactics defend both you and your mount.

**Prerequisites:** [Mounted Combat], [Shield Focus].

**Benefit:** You may add your base shield bonus (including the
bonus from [Shield Focus] but not including enhancement bonuses)
to your mount's AC. In addition, you may add this bonus when
making a [Ride] check to negate a hit against your mount using
the [Mounted Combat] feat.

### Mounted Skirmisher (Combat) {#mounted-skirmisher}


You are adept at attacking from upon a swift moving steed.

**Prerequisites:** [Ride] rank 14, [Mounted Combat], [Trick
  Riding].

**Benefit:** If your mount moves its speed or less, you can still
take a full-attack action.

**Normal:** If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only
take an attack action.

### Outflank (Combat, Teamwork) {#outflank} 


You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are
flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls
increases to +4. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit
against the flanked creature, it provokes an attack of
opportunity from your ally.

### Paired Opportunists (Combat, Teamwork) {#paired-opportunists}


You know how to make an enemy pay for lax defenses.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of
opportunity against creatures that you both threaten. Enemies
that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke
attacks of opportunity from you so long as you threaten them
(even if the situation or an ability would normally deny you the
attack of opportunity). This does not allow you to take more than
one attack of opportunity against a creature for a given action.

### Parry Spell


You can throw an enemy spell back at its caster.

**Prerequisites:** [Spellcraft] 15 ranks, [Improved Counterspell]
.

**Benefit:** Whenever you successfully counter a spell, it
returns back to its caster. This works exactly like the *[spell
turning]* spell.

### Parting Shot (Combat) {#parting-shot}


You are an expert skirmisher, able to rain missiles upon your
enemies whether advancing or retreating.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Dodge], [Mobility], Point Blank Shot,
[Shot on the Run], base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** Once per encounter, when using the withdraw action,
you can make a single ranged attack at any point during your
movement.

**Normal:** You cannot attack when using the withdraw action.

**Special:** Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery
combat style may select [Parting Shot] as a combat style feat.

### Pass For Human


You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your
own race.

**Prerequisite:** Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special).

**Benefit:** You receive a +10 bonus on [Disguise] checks to
disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for
disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do
so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take
10 on your [Disguise] check, meaning most people tend to assume
you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.

**Special:** A halfling may take this feat, but must have the
[Childlike] feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats
stack.

### Perfect Strike (Combat) {#perfect-strike}


When wielding a monk weapon, your attacks can be extremely
precise.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, [Improved Unarmed Strike],
  base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before
you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the
attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the
attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can
roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of
these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your
confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical
threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every
four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than
once per round.

**Special:** A weapon master monk or zen archer monk receives
[Perfect Strike] as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does
not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an perfect strike
attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus
one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes
other than monk.

### Persistent Spell (Metamagic) {#persistent-spell}


You can modify a spell to become more tenacious when its targets
resist its effect.

**Benefit:** Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell
or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the
spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a
creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full
effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving
throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher
than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the
spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

### Point Blank Master (Combat) {#point-blank-master}


You are adept at firing ranged weapons in close quarters.

**Prerequisite:** [Weapon Specialization] with selected ranged
weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of ranged weapon. You do not provoke
attacks of opportunity when firing the selected weapon while
threatened.

**Normal:** Using a ranged weapon while you are threatened
provokes attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery
combat style may select [Point Blank Master] as a combat style
feat, but he must have [Weapon Focus] instead of [Weapon
Specialization] in the selected weapon.

### Practiced Tactician


With only a few quick gestures and commands, you can direct
others in combat.

**Prerequisite:** Tactician class feature.

**Benefit:** You can use your tactician ability to grant allies a
teamwork feat one additional time per day.

**Special:** You can gain [Practiced Tactician] multiple
times. Its effects stack.

### Precise Strike (Combat, Teamwork) {#precise-strike}


You are skilled at striking where it counts, as long as an ally
distracts your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are
flanking the same the creature, you deal an additional 1d6 points
of precision damage with each successful melee attack. This bonus
damage stacks with other sources of precision damage, such as
sneak attack.  This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical
hit.

### Preferred Spell


You find it very easy to cast one particular spell.

**Prerequisites:** [Spellcraft] 5 ranks, [Heighten Spell].

**Benefit:** Choose one spell which you have the ability to
cast. You can cast that spell spontaneously by sacrificing a
prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can
apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast
it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or
spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not
affect the casting time.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a
different spell.

### Punishing Kick (Combat) {#punishing-kick}


Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or knock back
your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, Wis 13, [Improved Unarmed Strike],
  base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before
you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the
attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally
and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock
them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet
directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it
can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone,
the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 +
1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the
effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for
every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no
more than once per round.

**Special:** A hungry ghost monk receives [Punishing Kick] as a
bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the
prerequisites. A monk may attempt a punishing kick attack a
number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more
time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than
monk.

### Pushing Assault (Combat) {#pushing-assault}


A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized
opponent backward.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, [Power Attack], base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a
two-handed weapon attack modified by the [Power Attack] feat, you
can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you
instead of dealing the extra damage from [Power Attack]. If you
score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet
directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space
it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the
attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.

### Racial Heritage


The blood of a non-human ancestor flows in your veins.

**Prerequisite:** Human.

**Benefit:** Choose another humanoid race. You count as both
human and that race for any effects related to race. For example,
if you choose dwarf, you are considered both a human and a dwarf
for the purpose of taking traits, feats, how spells and magic
items affect you, and so on.

### Raging Vitality


While raging, you are full of vigor and health.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, rage class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are raging, the morale bonus to your
Constitution increases by +2. Your rage does not end if you
become unconscious. While unconscious you must still expend
rounds of rage per day each round.

### Ray Shield (Combat) {#ray-shield}


You can even deflect rays with your shield.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, [Missile Shield], [Spellbreaker].

**Benefit:** You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to
use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with
a ranged touch attack (including rays and similar magical
effects), you may deflect it so that you take no damage from
it. Your shield suffers the full effects of the spell or effect,
if applicable.

### Razortusk


Your powerful jaws and steely teeth are deadly enough to give you
a bite attack.

**Prerequisite:** Half-orc.

**Benefit:** You can make a bite attack for 1d4 points of damage,
plus your Strength modifier. You're considered proficient in this
attack and can apply feats or effects appropriate to natural
attacks to it. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite
is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base
attack bonus -5, and adds half your Strength modifier to damage.

### Reach Spell (Metamagic) {#reach-spell}


Your spells go farther than normal.

**Benefit:** You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close,
or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using
the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach
spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's
actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a
spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a
spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that
require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.

Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not
benefit from this feat.

### Rending Claws (Combat) {#rending-claws}


Your claw attacks do greater harm to your enemy.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, two claw natural weapon attacks, base
attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you hit a creature with two claw attacks in the
same turn, the second claw attack deals an additional 1d6 points
of damage.  This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied
on a critical hit.  You can use this feat once per round.

### Repositioning Strike (Combat) {#repositioning-strike}


Your critical hits can move your foes where you wish.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise], [Improved Trip],
  base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
attack, you can move your opponent, in addition to the normal
damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds
your opponent's CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the
reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of
opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a reposition combat maneuver to
reposition an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the
following feats to a given critical hit: [Bull Rush Strike],
[Disarming Strike], [Repositioning Strike], [Sundering Strike],
or [Tripping Strike]. You may choose to use this feat after you
make your confirmation roll.

### Saving Shield (Combat) {#saving-shield}


You deflect attacks that could mean your ally's death.

**Prerequisite:** [Shield Proficiency].

**Benefits**: Whenever an adjacent ally is the target of an
attack, you can, as an immediate action, grant that adjacent ally
a +2 shield bonus to AC. You must be wielding a light shield,
heavy shield, or tower shield to use this feat.

### Second Chance (Combat) {#second-chance}


Quick reflexes turn missed strikes into second chances.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise], base attack bonus
  +6.

attack, you can forgo making any other attacks for the rest of
your turn to reroll that attack at your highest base attack
bonus.

### Selective Spell (Metamagic) {#selective-spell}


Your allies need not fear friendly fire.

**Prerequisite:** [Spellcraft] 10 ranks.

**Benefit:** When casting a selective spell with an area effect
and a duration of instantaneous, you can choose a number of
targets in the area equal to the ability score modifier used to
determine bonus spells of the same type (Charisma for bards,
oracles, paladins, sorcerers, and summoners; Intelligence for
witches and wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, inquisitors, and
rangers). These targets are excluded from the effects of your
spell. A selective spell uses up a spell slot one level higher
than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not have an area of effect do not benefit from
this feat.

### Shadow Strike (Combat) {#shadow-strike}


You accurately strike even those you cannot clearly see.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can deal precision damage, such as sneak attack
damage, against targets with concealment (but not total
concealment).

### Shared Insight


You deftly direct others' attentions where you wish.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, half-elf.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can grant all friendly
creatures within 30 feet who can see or hear you a +2 bonus on
[Perception] checks for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum 1 round).

### Sharp Senses


Your senses are especially sharp, even for your kind.

**Prerequisite:** Keen senses racial trait.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 racial bonus on [Perception] skill
checks. This replaces the normal bonus from the keen senses
racial trait.

**Normal:** The keen senses trait normally grants a +2 racial
bonus on [Perception] skill checks.

### Shield of Swings (Combat) {#shield-of-swings}


A wild frenzy of attacks serves to bolster your defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Power Attack], base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you take a full-attack action while wielding a
two-handed weapon, you can choose to reduce the damage by 1/2 to
gain a +4 shield bonus to AC and CMD until the beginning of your
next turn. The reduction in damage applies until the beginning of
your next turn.

### Shield Specialization (Combat) {#shield-specialization}


You have mastered the use of one type of shield.

**Prerequisites:** Proficiency with selected shield, [Shield
  Focus], fighter level 4th.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of shield (buckler, light, heavy, or
tower shield). With the selected shield, you gain a +2 bonus to
your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls. In
addition, you may add your base shield bonus (including the bonus
from [Shield Focus] but not including enhancement bonuses) to
your CMD.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects
do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
type of shield.

### Shield Wall (Combat, Teamwork) {#shield-wall}


You form a unified defense with those around you.

**Prerequisite:** [Shield Proficiency].

**Benefit:** Whenever you are wielding a shield and are adjacent
to an ally wielding a shield who also has this feat, the AC bonus
from your shield increases, depending on the shield wielded by
your ally. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield,
your shield bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a
heavy shield or a tower shield, your shield bonus increases by
+2. You keep these bonuses even if your ally loses his shield
bonus due to making a shield bash attack.  If an adjacent ally
with this feat uses a tower shield to grant total cover, you also
benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge of the
shield (*Core Rulebook*153).

### Shielded Caster (Teamwork) {#shielded-caster}


Your allies cover you while you cast complicated spells.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you receive a +4 competence bonus on concentration
checks. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield,
this bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy
shield or a tower shield, this bonus increases by +2. Finally, if
an enemy threatening you and your ally has the [Disruptive] feat,
or another ability that increases the DC of concentration checks,
the amount of the increase is halved.

### Sickening Spell (Metamagic) {#sickening-spell}


You can sicken creatures with your spells.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged
by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they
become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original
level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a
successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does
not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate
the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the
creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic
effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening
spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's
actual level.

Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

### Sidestep (Combat) {#sidestep}


You can reposition yourself after a foe's missed swing.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Dodge], [Mobility].

**Benefit:** Whenever an opponent misses you with a melee attack,
you may move 5 feet as an immediate action so long as you remain
within that opponent's threatened area. This movement does not
provoke attacks of opportunity. If you take this step, you cannot
take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action
to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total
movement.

### Smash (Combat) {#smash}


You overcome obstacles by breaking them.

**Prerequisites:** [Power Attack], half-orc.

**Benefit:** When you attack an inanimate, unattended object, you
ignore the first 5 points of its hardness. You also receive a +5
bonus on Strength checks made to knock down or break open doors.

**Special:** The benefits of this feat do not apply to sunder
attempts or attacks against constructs, only attacks on
inanimate, unattended objects.

### Smell Fear


You can catch the sour scent of fear on the wind.

**Prerequisites:** [Keen Scent], half-orc or orc.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 bonus on [Perception] checks to
detect creatures with the shaken, frightened, or panicked
conditions using scent. You can substitute your [Perception]
skill for [Sense Motive] skill checks if the subject has one of
the previous conditions or is attempting to cover up their fear
in some way.

### Sociable


You have a way of helping others to get along.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, half-elf.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you grant all friendly creatures
within 30 feet who can see or hear you (including yourself) a +2
bonus on [Diplomacy] checks for a number of rounds equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).

### Spell Perfection


You are unequaled at the casting of one particular spell.

**Prerequisites:** [Spellcraft] 15 ranks, at least three
metamagic feats.

**Benefit:** Pick one spell which you have the ability to
cast. Whenever you cast that spell you may apply any one
metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level
or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell
does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you
have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus
to any aspect of this spell (such as [Spell Focus], [Spell
Penetration], [Weapon Focus] [ray], and so on), double the bonus
granted by that feat when applied to this spell.

### Spider Step


Your physical mastery grants you an impossible stride.

**Prerequisites:** [Acrobatics] 6 ranks, [Climb] 6 ranks, monk
level 6th.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can move up to half your slow
fall distance across a wall or ceiling or across ropes, branches,
or even water or other surfaces that cannot support your
weight. You must reach a solid, level surface by the end of your
turn or you will fall.

### Stabbing Shot (Combat) {#stabbing-shot}


You can clear the way to continue using your bow.

**Prerequisites:** [Rapid Shot], elf.

**Benefit:** When adjacent to an opponent and making a
full-attack action with a longbow or shortbow (including
composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against
that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the
attack hits—whether or not it does damage—your target is pushed
back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow
normally, at the original target, or at another target within
range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from [Rapid
Shot], and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee
attack and the ranged attacks) take a -2 penalty. If your initial
attack leaves you with no enemies threatening you, you can make
the subsequent ranged attack or attacks without provoking attacks
of opportunity.

### Steel Soul

  attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** When using the [Step Up] or [Following Step] feats
to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee
attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus. This
attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the
round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of
actions you can usually take each round.

**Normal:** You can usually only take one standard action and one
5-foot step each round.

### Stone-Faced


Rocks show more expression than you.

**Prerequisite:** Dwarf.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 bonus on [Bluff] checks to lie or

  dwarf.

**Benefit:** When you use bardic performance with audible
components underground, the range or area of your chosen
performance is doubled, and you can affect deaf creatures if they
possess tremorsense and are in your new range. In addition, the
DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased
by +2 for creatures of the earth subtype, regardless of where the
performance occurs.

### Stunning Assault (Combat) {#stunning-assault}


You powerful but imprecise attacks can stun your enemies.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Power Attack], base attack bonus +16.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee
attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to stun targets you hit

bonus. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack
roll, and its effects last until your next turn.

Whenever you summon your eidolon, it is more powerful for a brief
period of time.

**Prerequisite:** Eidolon class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you summon your eidolon, you may give it a
+2 enhancement bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, or

ritual is complete.

### Sundering Strike (Combat) {#sundering-strike}


Your critical hits can sunder your foes' weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Improved Sunder], [Power Attack],
  base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
attack, you can sunder your opponent's weapon, in addition to the
normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll
exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may deal damage to your
opponent's weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll
normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an
attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a sunder combat maneuver to sunder
an opponent's weapon.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the
following feats to a given critical hit: [Bull Rush Strike],
[Disarming Strike], [Repositioning Strike], [Sundering Strike],
or [Tripping Strike]. You may choose to use this feat after you
make your confirmation roll.

### Swap Places (Combat, Teamwork) {#swap-places}


You are skilled at changing places with your ally during a
chaotic melee.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has
this feat, you can move into your ally's square as part of normal
movement.  At the same time, your ally moves into your previous
space as an immediate action. Both you and your ally must be
willing and able to move to take advantage of this feat. Your
ally must be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally
does not provoke an attack of opportunity from this movement, but
you provoke as normal. This movement does not count against your
ally's movement on his next turn.

### Swift Aid (Combat) {#swift-aid}


With a quick but harmless swipe, you can aid an ally's assault.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise], base attack bonus
  +6.

**Benefit:** As a swift action, you can attempt the aid another
action, granting your ally either a +1 bonus on his next attack
roll or a +1 bonus to his AC.

**Normal:** Aid another is a standard action.

### Taunt


You may be small, but your remarks cut others down to size.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You can demoralize opponents using [Bluff] rather
than [Intimidate] (see the [Intimidate] skill description for
details) and take no skill check penalty for being smaller than
your target.

### Team Up (Combat) {#team-up}


When you are ganging up against an enemy, you can aid an ally
with a quick feint.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise], [Gang Up], base
attack bonus +6.

adjacent to an opponent, you can attempt the aid another action
as a move action.

### Teleport Tactician (Combat) {#teleport-tactician}


You are highly alert for enemies using teleportation to approach
you or flee from you.

**Prerequisites:** [Combat Reflexes], [Disruptive],
[Spellbreaker].

**Benefit:** Any creature using a teleportation effect to enter
or leave a square threatened by you provokes an attack of
opportunity, even if casting defensively or using a supernatural
ability.

### Tenacious Transmutation


Your mastery of the magic of changing makes your transmutations
more durable.

**Prerequisite:** [Spell Focus] (transmutation).

**Benefit:** The DC of caster level checks to dispel or remove
your transmutations increases by 2; even if the spell is negated,
its effects persist for 1 additional round before dissipating.

### Thundering Spell (Metamagic) {#thundering-spell}


You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder
or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged
by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it
becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original
level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a
successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does
not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate
the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the
creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic
effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell
uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual
level.

Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

### Touch of Serenity (Combat) {#touch-of-serenity}


With a single touch you can reduce the threat of even the most
savage of foes.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 18, [Improved Unarmed Strike], base attack
  bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before
you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the
attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage and
bestows no other effect or condition, but the target cannot cast
spells or attack (including attacks of opportunity and attacks as
immediate actions) for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Will
saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your
Wisdom modifier. You may attempt a touch of serenity once per day
for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no
more than once per round.

**Special:** A monk of the lotus receives [Touch of Serenity] as
a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the
prerequisites. A monk may attempt a touch of serenity a number of
times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day
for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

### Trick Riding (Combat) {#trick-riding}


You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you
can make it look like art.

**Prerequisites:** [Ride] 9 ranks, [Mounted Combat].

**Benefit:** While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to
make [Ride] skill checks for any task listed in the [Ride] skill
with a DC of 15 or lower.  You do not take a -5 penalty for
riding a mount bareback. You can make a check using [Mounted
Combat] to negate a hit on your mount twice per round instead of
just once.

### Tripping Strike (Combat) {#tripping-strike}


The force intrinsic to your critical hits can knock your foes
down.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise], [Improved Trip],
  base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee
attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal
damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds
your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from
the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you
can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.

**Normal:** You must perform a trip combat maneuver to trip an
  opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the
following feats to a given critical hit: [Bull Rush Strike],
[Disarming Strike], [Repositioning Strike], [Sundering Strike],
or [Tripping Strike]. You may choose to use this feat after you
make your confirmation roll.

### Under and Over (Combat) {#under-and-over}


You can slip under a foe trying to grab you, knocking him off
balance.

**Prerequisites:** [Agile Maneuvers], Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple
you and fails, you may make a trip attack as an immediate action
against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an
attack of opportunity.

### Underfoot (Combat) {#underfoot}


You slip under and around your larger foes.

**Prerequisites:** [Dodge], [Mobility], Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 dodge bonus on [Acrobatics] checks
to move past opponents without provoking attacks of opportunity,
so long as they are larger than you. In addition, you gain a +2
dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused
when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened
area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by [Mobility], for a
total bonus of +6).

### Vermin Heart


You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter,
and sting.

**Prerequisite:** Wild empathy class feature.

**Benefit:** You may target vermin with spells and special
abilities that only affect animals (although they are still
affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild
empathy to influence vermin as easily as you influence animals.

### War Singer


Your songs draw upon the savage chants and brutal ways of your
people, inspiring those around you to new heights of violence and
savagery.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, bardic performance class feature,
half-orc or orc.

**Benefit:** When you use bardic performance with audible
components on a battlefield (any area where a combat involving a
dozen or more combatants is taking place), the range or area of
your chosen performance is doubled. In addition, the DC for
saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2
for creatures of the orc subtype, regardless of where the
performance occurs.

### Well-Prepared


Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies
close at hand.

**Prerequisite:** Halfling.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when confronted with a situation that
calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a
[Sleight of Hand] check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in
gold pieces to “happen” to have such an item on your person. For
example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid
would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily
carry—if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example,
you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical
items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as
the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your
pequipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat
until you have at least a day to resupply and “acquire” new
items. You must pay for these items normally.

**Special:** At the GM's option, a character can substitute the
[Survival] skill for [Sleight of Hand] with this feat.  Such a
choice is permanent.
