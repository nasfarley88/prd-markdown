## Alchemist

Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully
experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist
is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and
dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of
alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as
merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true
alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than cast magic like a
spellcaster, the alchemist captures his own magic potential
within liquids and extracts he creates, infusing his chemicals
with virulent power to grant him impressive skill with poisons,
explosives, and all manner of self-transformative magic.

**Role**: The alchemist's reputation is not softened by his
exuberance (some would say dangerous recklessness) in perfecting
his magical extracts and potion-like creations, infusing these
substances with magic siphoned from his aura and using his own
body as experimental stock. Nor is it mollified by the
alchemist's almost gleeful passion for building explosive bombs
and discovering strange new poisons and methods for their
use. These traits, while making him a liability and risk for most
civilized organizations and institutions of higher learning, seem
to fit quite well with most adventuring groups.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Class Features


The following are class features of the alchemist.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Alchemists are proficient with
all simple weapons and bombs. They are also proficient with light
armor, but not with shields.

**Alchemy (Su)**: Alchemists are not only masters of creating
mundane alchemical substances such as alchemist's fire and
smokesticks, but also of fashioning magical potion-like extracts
in which they can store spell effects. In effect, an alchemist
prepares his spells by mixing ingredients into a number of
extracts, and then “casts” his spells by drinking the
extract. When an alchemist creates an extract or bomb, he infuses
the concoction with a tiny fraction of his own magical power-this
enables the creation of powerful effects, but also binds the
effects to the creator.

When using [Craft] (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, an
alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on
the [Craft] (alchemy) check. In addition, an alchemist can use
[Craft] (alchemy) to identify potions as if using *[detect
magic]*.  He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a
check.

An alchemist can create three special types of magical
items-extracts, bombs, and mutagens. Bombs are explosive splash
weapons, and mutagens are transformative elixirs that the
alchemist drinks to enhance his physical abilities-both of these
are detailed in their own sections below.

Extracts are the most varied of the three. In many ways, they
behave like spells in potion form, and as such their effects can
be dispelled by effects like *[dispel magic]*using the
alchemist's level as the caster level. Unlike potions, though,
extracts can have powerful effects and duplicate spells that a
potion normally could not.

An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each
level per day. His base daily allotment of extracts is given on
Table 2-1. In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he
has a high Intelligence score, in the same way a wizard receives
bonus spells per day.

When an alchemist mixes an extract, he infuses the chemicals and
reagents in the extract with magic siphoned from his own magical
aura.  An extract immediately becomes inert if it leaves the
alchemist's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his
keeping-an alchemist cannot normally pass out his extracts for
allies to use (but see the “infusion” discovery below). An
extract, once created, remains potent for 1 day before losing its
magic, so an alchemist must re-prepare his extracts every
day. Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work-most alchemists
prepare many extracts at the start of the day or just before
going on an adventure, but it's not uncommon for an alchemist to
keep some (or even all) of his daily extract slots open so that
he can prepare extracts in the field as needed.

Although the alchemist doesn't actually cast spells, he does have
a formulae list that determines what extracts he can create. An
alchemist can utilize spell-trigger items if the spell appears on
his formuale list, but not spell-completion items (unless he uses
[Use Magic Device] to do so).  An extract is “cast” by drinking
it, as if imbibing a potion-the effects of an extract exactly
duplicate the spell upon which its formula is based, save that
the spell always affects only the drinking alchemist.  An
alchemist can draw and drink an extract as a standard action. The
alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any
effect based on caster level.

Creating extracts consumes raw materials, but the cost of these
materials is insignificant-comparable to the valueless material
components of most spells. If a spell normally has a costly
material component, that component is expended during the
consumption of that particular extract. Extracts cannot be made
from spells that have focus requirements (alchemist extracts that
duplicate divine spells never have a divine focus requirement).

An alchemist can prepare an extract of any formula he knows. To
learn or use an extract, an alchemist must have an Intelligence
score equal to at least 10 + the extract's level. The Difficulty
Class for a saving throw against an alchemist's extract is 10 +
the extract level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.

An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his
formulae in a special tome called a formula book. He must refer
to this book whenever he prepares an extract but not when he
consumes it. An alchemist begins play with two 1st-level formulae
of his choice, plus a number of additional forumlae equal to his
Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level, he gains one
new formula of any level that he can create. An alchemist can
also add formulae to his book just like a wizard adds spells to
his spellbook, using the same costs, pages, and time
requirements. An alchemist can study a wizard's spellbook to
learn any formula that is equivalent to a spell the spellbook
contains. A wizard, however, cannot learn spells from a formula
book. An alchemist does not need to decipher arcane writings
before copying them.

**Bomb (Su)**: In addition to magical extracts, alchemists are
adept at swiftly mixing various volatile chemicals and infusing
them with their magical reserves to create powerful bombs that
they can hurl at their enemies. An alchemist can use a number of
bombs each day equal to his class level + his Intelligence
modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they
are created, they degrade and become inert-their method of
creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being
created and stored. In order to create a bomb, the alchemist must
use a small vial containing an ounce of liquid catalyst-the
alchemist can create this liquid catalyst from small amounts of
chemicals from an alchemy lab, and these supplies can be readily
refilled in the same manner as a spellcaster's component
pouch. Most alchemists create a number of catalyst vials at the
start of the day equal to the total number of bombs they can
create in that day-once created, a catalyst vial remains usable
by the alchemist for years.

Drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb requires
a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown
bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the [Throw Splash Weapon]
special attack. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected
using feats such as [Point-Blank Shot] and [Weapon Focus]. On a
direct hit, an alchemist's bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire
damage + additional damage equal to the alchemist's Intelligence
modifier. The damage of an alchemist's bomb increases by 1d6
points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage
is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as
[Vital Strike]). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always
equal to the bomb's minimum damage (so if the bomb would deal
2d6+4 points of fire damage on a direct hit, its splash damage
would be 6 points of fire damage). Those caught in the splash
damage can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this
save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's
Intelligence modifier.

Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the
Discovery ability) as they level up. An alchemist's bomb, like an
extract, becomes inert if used or carried by anyone else.

**[Brew Potion] (Ex)**: At 1st level, alchemists receive [Brew
Potion] as a bonus feat. An alchemist can brew potions of any
formulae he knows (up to 3rd level), using his alchemist level as
his caster level. The spell must be one that can be made into a
potion. The alchemist does not need to meet the prerequisites for
this feat.

**Mutagen (Su)**: At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to
create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his
physical prowess at the cost of his personality. It takes 1 hour
to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent
until used. An alchemist can only maintain one dose of mutagen at
a time-if he brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes
inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in an
alchemist's possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it
up again.

When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical
ability score-either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a
standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the
mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial,
granting him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus
to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist
level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist
takes a -2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores. If the
mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his
Intelligence. If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty
to his Wisdom. If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a
penalty to his Charisma.

A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a Fortitude save
(DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence
modifier) or become nauseated for 1 hour-a non-alchemist can
never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain
the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks
it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen,
the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately cease.) The
effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a
mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.

**[Throw Anything] (Ex)**: All alchemists gain the [Throw
Anything] feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. An alchemist adds
his Intelligence modifier to damage done with splash weapons,
including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already
included in the bomb class feature.

**Discovery (Su)**: At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels
thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible
alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot
select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries
can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites
first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that
modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (\*) do not
stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual
bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is
equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's
Intelligence modifier.

*Acid bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose
to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit
from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1
round later.

*Combine extracts*: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can
place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is
consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two
levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the
extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting
this discovery.

*Concentrate poison*: The alchemist can combine two doses of the
same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of
the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the
alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is
extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must
be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.

*Concussive bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can
choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4
points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every
odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct
hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they
succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th
level before selecting this discovery.

*Delayed bomb*: The alchemist can place a bomb so that it
explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact
with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen
by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If
at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed
bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A
delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts
to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from
the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as
if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the
bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent
creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one
delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the
previous bomb becomes inert. *[Dispel magic]* can neutralize a
delayed bomb, as can a successful [Disable Device] check (DC
equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence
modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Dilution*: Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion
or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from
one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter
of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted
cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute
extracts or mutagens. An alchemist must be at least 12th level
before selecting this discovery.

*Dispelling Bomb*: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can
choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal
damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb
are subject to a targeted *[dispel magic]* spell, using the
alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to
target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least
6th level before selecting this discovery.

*Elixir of life*: Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir
of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and
takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the
alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per
the spell *[true resurrection]*.  Alternatively, the alchemist
himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is
immediately targeted with a *[resurrection]* spell the next time
he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of
life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's
Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time
expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must
be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.

*Enhance potion*: A number of times per day equal to his
Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he
drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.

*Eternal potion*: If an alchemist drinks a potion that he
extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he
chooses to make another potion effect permanent. An alchemist
must be at least 16th level and must possess the extend potion
discovery before selecting this discovery.

*Explosive bomb\**: The alchemist's bombs now have a splash
radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a
direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points
of fire damage each round until the fire is
extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action
that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the
target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2
gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.

*Extend potion*: A number of times per day equal to his
Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he
drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function
at twice its normal duration.  This does not apply to extracts.

*Fast bombs*: An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create
enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The
alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round
action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him
additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a
ranged weapon. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Feral mutagen*: Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he
gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary
attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack
bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the
alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of
damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in
effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on [Intimidate]
skill checks.

*Force bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose
to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of
force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every
odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct
hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a
Reflex save. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Frost bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose
to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit
from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they
succeed on a Fortitude save.

*Grand mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural
armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score
(Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to
a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a
third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to
his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen
persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must be at least 16th level
and must possess the greater mutagen discovery before selecting
this discovery.

*Greater mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4
natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical
ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4
alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The
alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated mental ability
scores as long as the mutagen persists. An alchemist must be at
least 12th level before selecting this discovery.

*Infuse mutagen*: When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can
infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This
inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and
costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists
on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates
another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different
types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does
not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple
mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.

*Inferno bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an
alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of *[incendiary cloud]*
instead of *[fog cloud],*filling an area equal to twice the
bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be
at least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery
before selecting this discovery.

*Infusion*: When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse
it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract
created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As
long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the
alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be
imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.

*Madness bomb*: The alchemist's bombs do more than sear
flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from
a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of
Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the
bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of
damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of
Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each
madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a
minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at
least 12th level before selecting this discovery.

*Poison bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an
alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of *[cloudkill]* instead
of *[fog cloud]*, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's
splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at
least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before
selecting this discovery.

*Precise bombs*: Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can
select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier
that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the
bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.

*Shock bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose
to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a
direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.

*Smoke bomb\**: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose
to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The
cloud functions as *[fog cloud]*, filling an area equal to twice
the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.

*Sticky bomb*: The effects of the alchemist's bombs are
persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the
initial damage.  Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky
bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have
effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have
those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least
10th level before selecting this discovery.

*Sticky poison*: Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when
the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned
for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence
modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before
selecting this discovery.

*Stink bomb\**: The effects of the smoke created by an
alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of *[stinking cloud]*
instead of *[fog cloud]*, filling an area equal to twice the
bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the
smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.

**Poison Resistance (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2
bonus on all saving throws against poison. This bonus increases
to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level. At 10th
level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to poison.

**Poison Use (Ex)**: Alchemists are trained in the use of poison
and starting at 2nd level, cannot accidentally poison themselves
when applying poison to a weapon.

**Swift Alchemy (Ex)**: At 3rd level, an alchemist can create
alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes an alchemist
half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items, and he
can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.

**Swift Poisoning (Ex)**: At 6th level, an alchemist can apply a
dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action.

**Persistent Mutagen (Su)**: At 14th level, the effects of a
mutagen last for 1 hour per level.

**Instant Alchemy (Ex)**: At 18th level, an alchemist can create
alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He can create
any alchemical item as a full-round action if he succeeds at the
[Craft] (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources at hand
to fund the creation. He can apply poison to a weapon as an
immediate action.

**Grand Discovery (Su)**: At 20th level, the alchemist makes a
grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries,
but also learns a third discovery chosen from the list below,
representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of
significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of
these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments
and hard work.

*Awakened Intellect*: The alchemist's constant exposure to
strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score
permanently increases by 2 points.

*Eternal Youth*: The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging,
and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical
ability scores from advanced age. If the alchemist is already
taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.

*Fast Healing*: The alchemist's flesh responds to damage with
shocking speed-he gains fast healing 5.

*Philosopher's Stone*: The alchemist learns how to create a
[*philosopher's stone*], and can do so once per month at no
cost. Creating a *philosopher's stone* takes 1 day of work.

*Poison Touch*: The alchemist gains a poisonous touch, as if
under the effects of a *[poison]* spell. He can suppress or
activate this ability as a free action. The physical appearance
of how the alchemist generates and delivers his poisonous touch
varies from alchemist to alchemist.

*True Mutagen*: The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +8 natural
armor bonus and a +8 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen
persists (see Mutagen). An alchemist must possess the grand
mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.

## Cavalier


While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of
their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as
much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors,
known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it
above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback,
and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the
symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The
cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals,
the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.

**Role**: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield,
using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of
the fight.  Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing
their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The
cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own
in even the most delicate of social situations.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Dice**: d10.

### Class Skills


The cavalier's class skills are [Bluff] (Cha), [Climb] (Str),
[Craft] (Int), [Diplomacy] (Cha), [Handle Animal] (Cha),
[Intimidate] (Cha), [Profession] (Wis), [Ride] (Dex), [Sense
Motive] (Wis), and [Swim] (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Cavalier

  
### Class Features

The following are the class features of the cavalier.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Cavaliers are proficient with
all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy,
light, and medium) and with shields (except tower shields).

**Challenge (Ex)**: Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe
to combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target
within sight to challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal
extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of
his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier's
level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st
level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels
beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier's
concentration. The cavalier takes a -2 penalty to his Armor
Class, except against attacks made by the target of his
challenge.

The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or
unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge
also includes another effect which is listed in the section
describing the cavalier's order.

**Mount (Ex)**: A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and
trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a
druid's animal companion, using the cavalier's level as his
effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is
capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium cavalier
can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier can select a pony
or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is at least
4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.

A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on [Ride] checks
while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat
trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus
feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the share spells special
ability.

A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair
learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a
cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to
serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain
the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special
abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.

**Order (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a
specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of
bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each
order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must
follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits
from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of
an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy
process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is
made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old
order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one
entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once
accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new
order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending
upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

**Tactician (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork
feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this
feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to
all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain
the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every
two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the
prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this
ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per
day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.

**Cavalier's Charge (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to
make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier
receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while
mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier
does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge
attack while mounted.

**Expert Trainer (Ex)**: At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train
mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier
receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses
[Handle Animal] on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition,
he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or
train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required
by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount
at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.

**Banner (Ex)**: At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a
symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as
the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60
feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and
a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At
10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses
increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and
must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to
function.

**Bonus Feat**: At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter,
a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from
normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those
listed as combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites
of these bonus feats.

**Greater Tactician (Ex)**: At 9th level, the cavalier receives
an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the
prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to
his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician
ability is a swift action.

**Mighty Charge (Ex)**: At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make
devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range
of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This
increase does not stack with other effects that increase the
threat range of the weapon.  In addition, the cavalier can make a
free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his
charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not
provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Demanding Challenge (Ex)**: At 12th level, whenever a cavalier
declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat
he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of
the cavalier, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC from attacks made
by anyone other than the cavalier.

**Greater Banner (Ex)**: At 14th level, the cavalier's banner
becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet
receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and
compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is
displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the
banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an
additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is
targeting them. This save is made at the original DC.  Spells and
effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this
ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once
per day.

**Master Tactician (Ex)**: At 17th level, the cavalier receives
an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the
prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to
his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier
uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that
he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just
his bonus feats.

**Supreme Charge (Ex)**: At 20th level, whenever the cavalier
makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal
amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if
the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while
mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save
reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 +
the cavalier's base attack bonus.

### Cavalier Orders


The following orders represent the most common chosen by
cavaliers.  Members of these orders are not necessarily bound
together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of
cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.

#### Order of the Cockatrice


A cavalier who belongs to this order serves only himself, working
to further his own aims and increase his own prestige. Cavaliers
of this order tend to be selfish and concerned only with personal
goals and objectives.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must keep his own interests and aims
above those of all others. He must always accept payment when it
is due, rewards when earned, and an even (or greater) share of
loot. The cavalier must take every opportunity to increase his
own stature, prestige, and power.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the cockatrice cavalier
issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all melee
damage rolls made against the target of his challenge as long as
he is the only creature threatening the target (not counting his
mount). This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the
cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the cockatrice cavalier adds [Appraise]
(Int) and [Perform] (Cha) to his list of class skills. In
addition, an order of the cockatrice cavalier adds his Charisma
modifier to the DC on another creature's attempt to demoralize
him through [Intimidate] (in addition to his Wisdom modifier, as
normal).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier that belongs to the order of the
cockatrice gains the following abilities as he increases in
level.

*Braggart (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier can spend a standard
action to extol his own accomplishments and battle prowess. He
receives [Dazzling Display] as a bonus feat.  He does not need a
weapon in hand to use this ability. The cavalier receives a +2
morale bonus on melee attack rolls made against demoralized
targets.

*Steal Glory (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can steal the
glory from another creature's successful strike. Whenever a
creature other than the cavalier scores a critical hit against a
target that the cavalier is threatening, he can make an attack of
opportunity against the same target.

*Moment of Triumph (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can, as a
free action, declare a moment of triumph. For 1 round, the
cavalier receives a competence bonus equal to his Charisma
modifier on all ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls,
saving throws, and skill checks. This bonus is also added to his
AC. In addition, any critical threats he makes are automatically
confirmed. The cavalier can use this ability once per day.

#### Order of the Dragon


Cavaliers belonging to the order of the dragon dedicate
themselves to a group of like-minded individuals, be it a
mercenary company or a small band of adventurers. These cavaliers
believe in loyalty and friendship, and are willing to lay down
their lives to protect their allies.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must remain loyal to his allies and must
always work to further the aims of the group. He must protect his
allies from harm and defend their honor when called into doubt.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the dragon cavalier issues a
challenge, his allies receive a +1 circumstance bonus on melee
attack rolls against the target of his challenge whenever he is
threatening the target. This bonus increases by +1 for every four
levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the dragon cavalier adds [Perception]
(Wis) and [Survival] (Wis) to his list of class skills. In
addition, whenever an order of the dragon cavalier uses
[Survival] to provide food and water for his allies or to protect
his allies from harsh weather, he receives a bonus on the check
equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier that belongs to the order of the
dragon gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Aid Allies (Ex)*: At 2nd level, whenever an order of the dragon
cavalier uses the aid another action to assist one of his allies,
the ally receives a +3 bonus to his Armor Class, attack roll,
saving throw, or skill check. At 8th level, and every six levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by an additional +1.

*Strategy (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can spend a standard
action to grant one of a number of bonuses to all allies within
30 feet (including himself). The allies must be able to see or
hear the cavalier to receive this bonus. The cavalier can grant a
+2 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round, a +2 morale bonus on all attack
rolls for 1 round, or the ability to move up to their speed as an
immediate action once. The cavalier can grant a different bonus
to each ally within range, but allies can only benefit from this
ability once per combat.

*Act as One (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can spend a
standard action to move up to his speed and make a melee
attack. All allies within 30 feet can also move up to their speed
and make a melee attack as an immediate action. This movement and
attack can be made as a charge if the movement qualifies. All
attacks are made at a +2 bonus (this stacks with the bonus from a
charge) and all participants receive a +2 dodge bonus to their AC
for 1 round. A cavalier can use this ability once per combat.


#### Order of the Lion

A cavalier who belongs to this order has pledged himself to a
sovereign; be it a king, queen, or even the local
warlord. Cavaliers of this order are stalwart and dedicated to
their cause, willing to go any length to ensure the safety of
their lord and his domain.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must protect the life and lands of his
sovereign at all costs. He must obey the commands of his
sovereign without question. He must strive to expand the power
and prestige of his realm.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the lion cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks
made by the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by +1
for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the lion cavalier adds [Knowledge]
(local) (Int) and [Knowledge] (nobility) (Int) to his list of
class skills. An order of the lion cavalier can make [Knowledge]
(nobility) skill checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill,
he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level
(minimum +1) as long as the check involves his sovereign.

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier belonging to the order of the
lion gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Lion's Call (Ex)*: At 2nd level, an order of the lion cavalier
gains the ability to rally his allies. As a standard action, he
can give an encouraging speech which grants all allies within 60
feet a competence bonus on their saving throws against fear equal
to his Charisma modifier and a +1 competence bonus on attack
rolls for a number of rounds equal to his cavalier level. If an
ally within range is under the effect of a spell or ability that
causes him to be frightened or panicked, he can immediately make
another saving throw to resist the effect (if allowed).

*For the King (Ex)*: At 8th level, an order of the lion cavalier
can call out to his allies, inspiring them to greatness. As a
swift action, the cavalier can grant a competence bonus equal to
his Charisma modifier on all attack and damage rolls to all
allies within 30 feet. This bonus lasts for 1 round. This ability
can be used once per combat.

*Shield of the Liege (Ex)*: At 15th level, an order of the lion
cavalier can protect those around him. Allies that are adjacent
to the cavalier receive a +2 shield bonus to their AC. In
addition, as an immediate action, the cavalier can redirect an
attack made at a creature adjacent to himself, as long as the
creature making the attack is within the cavalier's reach. This
ability must be declared before the attack roll is made. The
attack is made against the cavalier's AC and defenses, even if
the creature could not normally reach or attack the cavalier. The
cavalier loses any cover or concealment bonuses when subject to
the redirected attack.


#### Order of the Shield

Cavaliers who join the order of the shield devote their lives to
protecting the common folk, from the simple farmer to the honest
craftsman. These cavaliers stand before the tide, protecting the
innocent from roving marauders and hungry monsters.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must protect the lives and prosperity of
the common folk, shielding them from the deprivations of those
who would seek to cause them harm or exploit them. He must give
charity when it is warranted and aid when needed. He must take no
action that would cause harm or hardship to those who cannot
defend themselves.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the shield cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made
against the target of his challenge if the target makes an attack
against a target other than the cavalier. This bonus lasts for 1
minute. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the
cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the shield cavalier adds [Heal] (Wis) and
[Knowledge] (local) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever
an order of the shield cavalier uses the [Heal] skill on a
creature other than himself, he receives a bonus on the check
equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).

**Order Abilities**: A cavalier belonging to the order of the
shield gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

*Resolute (Ex)*: At 2nd level, whenever the cavalier takes damage
from a melee or ranged attack while wearing heavy armor, the
cavalier can convert 1 point of lethal damage to 1 point of
nonlethal damage. He can use this ability once each time he takes
damage. This ability cannot be used to convert ability damage,
ability drain, or energy damage to nonlethal damage. At 6th
level, and every four levels thereafter, the amount of damage the
cavalier can convert increases by 1.

*Stem the Tide (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier receives [Stand
Still] as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the
prerequisites. Instead of making a combat maneuver check to stop
the creature from moving, a cavalier with this ability can elect
to make a normal attack instead. If the attack hits and deals
damage, the target must stop moving, just as if the cavalier had
made a successful combat maneuver check.

*Protect the Meek (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can move to
intercept foes. As an immediate action, he can move up to his
speed (or his mount's speed, if mounted) and make a single melee
attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as
normal. The cavalier must end his movement adjacent to an
enemy. On his next turn, the cavalier is staggered and cannot use
this ability again for 1 round.


#### Order of the Star

Cavaliers who join the order of the star dedicate themselves to
the protection and service of a faith and its members. Cavaliers
belonging to this order tend to follow many of the tenets and
guides of the religion that they serve. When a cavalier joins
this order, he should select a single religion to serve.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must strive to protect the faith and all
those who follow its teachings, from priest to common man. He
must adhere to the strictures of the faith, promote its cause
whenever possible, and serve the agents of the divine.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the star cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all his saving throws
as long as he is threatening the target of his challenge. This
bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier
possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the star cavalier adds [Heal] (Wis) and
[Knowledge] (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An
order of the star cavalier can make [Knowledge] (religion) skill
checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a
bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1)
as long as the check involves his chosen faith.

**Order Abilities**: An order of the star cavalier gains the
following abilities as he increases in level.

*Calling (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier can make a short
prayer as a standard action, filling him with confidence in his
abilities. At any point in the next minute, he can receive a
competence bonus on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw,
or skill check equal to his Charisma modifier. He must declare
that he is using this bonus before the roll is made. He can use
this ability up to four times per day, once for each type of
check or roll. In addition, the cavalier adds 1/2 his cavalier
level to any levels of paladin or cleric he might possess for the
purposes of determining the effects of channel energy or lay on
hands.

*For the Faith (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier can call upon
his faith to bolster himself in combat. As a free action, the
cavalier can call out the name of his deity, granting him a
morale bonus on attack rolls equal to his Charisma modifier for 1
round. In addition, any allies within 30 feet that share his
faith also receive half this bonus (minimum +1). The cavalier can
use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day
at 12th level and every four levels thereafter.

*Retribution (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can take
retribution on those who dare to strike an agent of his
faith. Whenever an enemy makes a successful melee attack against
the cavalier or an adjacent ally devoted to the same faith as the
cavalier, the enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the
cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 morale bonus on the attack
of opportunity. If the attack made by the enemy was a critical
hit, the cavalier may treat the enemy as the target of his
challenge for the attack of opportunity. The cavalier can use
this ability once per round.


#### Order of the Sword

Cavaliers who join the order of the sword dedicate their lives to
the code of chivalry, living a life of honor, valor, and
fairness. Cavaliers of this order tend to swear service to a lord
or a lady. Of all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps
the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.

**Edicts**: The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger,
mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and
the meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all
things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor
of those he serves.

**Challenge**: Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a
challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against
the target of his challenge so long as he is astride his
mount. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the
cavalier possesses.

**Skills**: An order of the sword cavalier adds [Knowledge]
(nobility) (Int) and [Knowledge] (religion) (Int) to his list of
class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses [Sense Motive] to oppose
a [Bluff] check, he receives a competence bonus on the check
equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).

**Order Abilities**: An order of the sword cavalier receives the
following abilities as he increases in level.

*By My Honor (Ex)*: At 2nd level, the cavalier must select one
alignment. As long as he maintains the selected alignment, he
receives a +2 morale bonus to one saving throw of his choice.

*Mounted Mastery (Ex)*: At 8th level, the cavalier ignores the
armor check penalty when using the [Ride] skill, regardless of
whether or not the creature he is riding is his mount.  Whenever
he makes a charge attack while mounted, he receives a +4 dodge
bonus to his AC to avoid attacks set against his charge. When
making such an attack, he can add his mount's Strength modifier
to the damage roll, in addition to his own. He also receives a
bonus feat, chosen from the following list: [Mounted Combat],
[Ride-By Attack], [Skill Focus] ([Ride]), [Spirited Charge],
[Trample], or [Unseat]. He must qualify for the feat selected.

*Knight's Challenge (Ex)*: At 15th level, the cavalier can make a
knight's challenge once per day. This functions like a normal
challenge, but the cavalier adds his Charisma bonus on all attack
rolls and damage rolls made against the target of his
challenge. In addition, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on
attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the target of
his knight's challenge.



## Inquisitor

Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the
faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is
not enough.  Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they
are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the
church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice
alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their
goals.

**Role**: Inquisitors tend to move from place to place, chasing
down enemies and researching emerging threats. As a result, they
often travel with others, if for no other reason than to mask
their presence.  Inquisitors work with members of their faith
whenever possible, but even such allies are not above suspicion.

**Alignment**: An inquisitor's alignment must be within one step
of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil
axis.

**Hit Dice**: d8.

### Class Skills


The inquisitor's class skills are [Bluff] (Cha), [Climb] (Str),
[Craft] (Int), [Diplomacy] (Cha), [Disguise] (Cha), [Heal] (Wis),
[Intimidate] (Cha), [Knowledge] (arcana) (Int), [Knowledge]
(dungeoneering) (Int), [Knowledge] (nature) (Int), [Knowledge]
(planes) (Int), [Knowledge] (religion) (Int), [Perception] (Wis),
[Profession] (Wis), [Ride] (Dex), [Sense Motive] (Wis),
[Spellcraft] (Int), [Stealth] (Dex), [Survival] (Wis), and [Swim]
(Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

The following are class features of the inquisitor.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: An inquisitor is proficient
with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, longbow,
repeating crossbow, shortbow, and the favored weapon of her
deity. She is also proficient with light armor, medium armor, and
shields (except tower shields).

**Spells**: An inquisitor casts divine spells drawn from the
inquisitor spell list. She can cast any spell she knows at any
time without preparing it ahead of time, assuming she has not yet
used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

To learn or cast a spell, an inquisitor must have a Wisdom score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for
a saving throw against an inquisitor's spell is 10 + the spell
level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.

An inquisitor can cast only a certain number of spells of each
spell level each day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on
Table 2-3. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she
has a high Wisdom score (see Table 1-3 of the *PF RPG
Core Rulebook*).

An inquisitor's selection of spells is extremely limited. An
inquisitor begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two
1st-level spells of the inquisitor's choice. At each new
inquisitor level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated
on Table 2-4. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an
inquisitor knows is not affected by her Wisdom score. The numbers
on Table 2-4 are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third inquisitor level
thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), an inquisitor can choose to
learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect,
the inquisitor “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new
one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell
being exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the
highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The inquisitor may
swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose
whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains
new spells known for the level.

**Domain**: Like a cleric's deity, an inquisitor's deity
influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, and her
values. Although not as tied to the tenets of the deity as a
cleric, an inquisitor must still hold such guidelines in high
regard, despite that fact she can go against them if it serves
the greater good of the faith. An inquisitor can select one
domain from among those belonging to her deity. She can select an
alignment domain only if her alignment matches that domain.  With
the GM's approval, an inquisitor can be devoted to an ideal
instead of a deity, selecting one domain to represent her
personal inclination and abilities. The restriction on alignment
domains still applies.

Each domain grants a number of domain powers, depending on the
level of the inquisitor. An inquisitor does not gain the bonus
spells listed for each domain, nor does she gain bonus spell
slots. The inquisitor uses her level as her effective cleric
level when determining the power and effect of her domain
powers. If the inquisitor has cleric levels, one of her two
domain selections must be the same domain selected as an
inquisitor. Levels of cleric and inquisitor stack for the purpose
of determining domain powers and abilities, but not for bonus
spells.

**Judgment (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, an inquisitor can
pronounce judgment upon her foes as a swift action. Starting when
the judgment is made, the inquisitor receives a bonus or special
ability based on the type of judgment made.

At 1st level, an inquisitor can use this ability once per day. At
4th level and every three levels thereafter, the inquisitor can
use this ability one additional time per day. Once activated,
this ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of
the bonuses immediately end. The inquisitor must participate in
the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened, panicked,
paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from
participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the
bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat
again.

When the inquisitor uses this ability, she must select one type
of judgment to make. As a swift action, she can change this
judgment to another type. If the inquisitor is evil, she receives
profane bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral
inquisitors must select profane or sacred bonuses. Once made,
this choice cannot be changed.

*Destruction*: The inquisitor is filled with divine wrath,
gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus
increases by +1 for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Healing*: The inquisitor is surrounded by a healing light,
gaining fast healing 1. This causes the inquisitor to heal 1
point of damage each round as long as the inquisitor is alive and
the judgment lasts. The amount of healing increases by 1 point
for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Justice*: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice,
granting a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus
increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she
possesses. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on all attack
rolls made to confirm critical hits.

*Piercing*: This judgment gives the inquisitor great focus and
makes her spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1 sacred
bonus on concentration checks and caster level checks made to
overcome a target's spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1
for every three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Protection*: The inquisitor is surrounded by a protective aura,
granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases
by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she possesses. At 10th
level, this bonus is doubled against attack rolls made to confirm
critical hits against the inquisitor.

*Purity*: The inquisitor is protected from the vile taint of her
foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all saving throws. This bonus
increases by +1 for every five inquisitor levels she
possesses. At 10th level, the bonus is doubled against curses,
diseases, and poisons.

*Resiliency*: This judgment makes the inquisitor resistant to
harm, granting DR 1/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every five
levels she possesses. At 10th level, this DR changes from magic
to an alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite
the inquisitor's. If she is neutral, the inquisitor does not
receive this increase.

*[Resistance]*: The inquisitor is shielded by a flickering aura,
gaining 2 points of energy resistance against one energy type
(acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the
judgment is declared. The protection increases by 2 for every
three inquisitor levels she possesses.

*Smiting*: This judgment bathes the inquisitor's weapons in a
divine light. The inquisitor's weapons count as magic for the
purposes of bypassing damage reduction. At 6th level, the
inquisitor's weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic,
evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage
reduction. The type selected must match one of the inquisitor's
alignments. If the inquisitor is neutral, she does not receive
this bonus. At 10th level, the inquisitor's weapons also count as
adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but
not for reducing hardness).

**Monster Lore (Ex)**: The inquisitor adds her Wisdom modifier on
[Knowledge] skill checks in addition to her Intelligence
modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and
weaknesses of creatures.

**Orisons**: Inquisitors learn a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, as noted on Table 2-4 under “Spells Known.” These spells
are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when
cast and may be used again. Orisons prepared using other spell
slots, such as those due to metamagic feats, are expended
normally.

**Stern Gaze (Ex)**: Inquisitors are skilled at sensing deception
and intimidating their foes. An inquisitor receives a morale
bonus on all [Intimidate] and [Sense Motive] checks equal to 1/2
her inquisitor level (minimum +1).

**Cunning Initiative (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds her
Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to her
Dexterity modifier.

***Detect Alignment* (Sp)**: At will, an inquisitor can use
*[detect chaos]*, *[detect evil]*, *[detect good]*, or *[detect
law]*. She can only use one of these at any given time.

**Track (Ex)**: At 2nd level, an inquisitor adds half her level
on [Survival] skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.

**Solo Tactics (Ex)**: At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor's
allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats
as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether the
inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies
do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually
possess the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions
must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for
the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus.

**Teamwork Feat**: At 3rd level, and every three levels
thereafter, the inquisitor gains a bonus feat in addition to
those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be
selected from those listed as teamwork feats. The inquisitor must
meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.

As a standard action, the inquisitor can choose to learn a new
bonus teamwork feat in place of the most recent bonus teamwork
feat she has already learned. In effect, the inquisitor loses the
bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can only change the
most recent teamwork feat gained. Whenever she gains a new
teamwork feat, the previous teamwork feat becomes set and cannot
be changed again. An inquisitor can change her most recent
teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom
modifier.

**Bane (Su)**: At 5th level, an inquisitor can imbue one of her
weapons with the *[bane]* weapon special ability as a swift
action. She must select one creature type when she uses this
ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is humanoid
or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a swift
action. This ability only functions while the inquisitor wields
the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this
ability if it is returned to the inquisitor before the duration
expires.  This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal
to the inquisitor's level. These rounds do not need to be
consecutive.

***Discern Lies* (Sp)**: At 5th level, an inquisitor can
*[discern lies]*, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per
day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be
consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.

**Second Judgment (Ex)**: At 8th level, whenever an inquisitor
uses her judgment ability, she selects two different judgments,
instead of one.  This only consumes one use of her judgment
ability. As a swift action, she can change one of these judgments
to another type.

**Stalwart (Ex)**: At 11th level, an inquisitor can use mental
and physical resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If she makes a
Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a
reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the
effect entirely. This ability can only be used if the inquisitor
is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless
inquisitor does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.

**Greater Bane (Su)**: At 12th level, whenever an inquisitor uses
her bane ability, the amount of bonus damage dealt by the weapon
against creatures of the selected type increases to 4d6.

**Exploit Weakness (Ex)**: At 14th level, the inquisitor learns
to take advantage of any opportunity that presents
itself. Whenever the inquisitor scores a critical hit, she
ignores any damage reduction the target might have. In addition,
if the target has regeneration, the creature loses regeneration
on the round following the critical hit and can die normally
during that round. Creatures whose regeneration always functions
are immune to this ability. Finally, if the inquisitor deals
energy damage to a creature with vulnerability to that energy
type, she deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.

**Third Judgment (Ex)**: At 16th level, whenever an inquisitor
uses her judgment ability, she selects three different judgments,
instead of just two. This only consumes one use of her judgment
ability. As a swift action, the inquisitor can change one of
these judgments to another type.

**Slayer (Ex)**: At 17th level, an inquisitor learns to focus her
judgment. Whenever an inquisitor uses her judgment ability, she
must select one type of judgment. She is treated as if she were 5
levels higher for the purposes of determining the bonus granted
by the judgment. Unlike other types of judgment, the one enhanced
by this ability cannot be changed for the remainder of the
judgment

**True Judgment (Su)**: At 20th level, an inquisitor can call
true judgment down upon a foe during combat. Whenever an
inquisitor uses her judgment ability, the inquisitor can invoke
true judgment on a foe as a swift action. Once declared, the
inquisitor can make a single melee (or ranged attack, if the foe
is within 30 feet) against the target. If the attack hits, it
deals damage normally and the target must make a Fortitude save
or die. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's
level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier. Regardless of whether
or not the save is made, the target creature is immune to the
inquisitor's true judgment ability for 24 hours. Once this
ability has been used, it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.

**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells**: An inquisitor can't
cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if
she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are
indicated by the chaotic, evil, good and lawful descriptors in
their spell descriptions.


### Ex-Inquisitors

An inquisitor who slips into corruption or changes to a
prohibited alignment loses all spells and the judgment
ability. She cannot thereafter gain levels as an inquisitor until
she atones (see the *[atonement]* spell description).

## Oracle

Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more
mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted
power without their choice, selected by providence to wield
powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric,
who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner
strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities
who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source,
oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their
beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift,
others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in
unforeseen ways.

**Role**: Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or
temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a
small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use
their spells and revelations to further their understanding of
their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending
to the poor and sick.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Dice**: d8.


### Class Skills

The oracle's class skills are [Craft] (Int), [Diplomacy] (Cha),
[Heal] (Wis), [Knowledge] (history) (Int), [Knowledge] (planes)
(Int), [Knowledge] (religion) (Int), [Profession] (Wis), [Sense
Motive] (Wis), and [Spellcraft] (Int). In addition, oracles
receive additional class skills depending upon their oracle
mystery.

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

The following are the class features of the oracle.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Oracles are proficient with all
simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except
tower shields).  Some oracle revelations grant additional
proficiencies.

**Spells**: An oracle casts divine spells drawn from the [cleric
spell lists]. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing
it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, an oracle must have a
Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The
Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an oracle's spell is
10 + the spell's level + the oracle's Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, an oracle can cast only a certain number
of spells per day of each spell level. Her base daily spell
allotment is given on Table 2-5. In addition, she receives bonus
spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 of
the *PF RPG Core Rulebook*).

Unlike other divine spellcasters, an oracle's selection of spells
is extremely limited. An oracle begins play knowing four 0-level
spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new oracle
level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table
2-6. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells an oracle knows
is not affected by her Charisma score; the numbers on Table 2-6
are fixed.

In addition to the spells gained by oracles as they gain levels,
each oracle also adds all of either the cure spells or the
inflict spells to her list of spells known (cure spells include
all spells with “cure” in the name, inflict spells include all
spells with “inflict” in the name).  These spells are added as
soon as the oracle is capable of casting them.  This choice is
made when the oracle gains her first level and cannot be changed.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered oracle level
after that (6th, 8th, and so on), an oracle can choose to learn a
new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the
oracle loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new
spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being
exchanged. An oracle may swap only a single spell at any given
level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the
same time that she gains new spells known for the level. She
cannot swap any cure or inflict spells, nor can she swap any
spells gained from her mystery.

Unlike a cleric, an oracle need not prepare her spells in
advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming
she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell
level. Oracles do not need to provide a divine focus to cast
spells that list divine focus (DF) as part of the components.

**Mystery**: Each oracle draws upon a divine mystery to grant her
spells and powers. This mystery also grants additional class
skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a
devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the
concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example,
an oracle with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and
found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans,
rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of
its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the
oracle gains levels. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking
her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be
changed.

At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, an oracle learns
an additional spell derived from her mystery. These spells are in
addition to the number of spells given on Table 2-6. They cannot
be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.

**Oracle's Curse (Ex)**: Each oracle is cursed, but this curse
comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made
at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle's
curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a
deity. An oracle's curse is based on her oracle level plus one
for every two levels or Hit Dice other than oracle. Each oracle
must choose one of the following curses.

*Clouded Vision*: Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for
you to see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can
see as if you had darkvision. At 5th level, this distance
increases to 60 feet. At 10th level, you gain blindsense out to a
range of 30 feet. At 15th level, you gain blindsight out to a
range of 15 feet.

*Deaf*: You cannot hear and suffer all of the usual penalties for
being deafened. You cast all of your spells as if they were
modified by the [Silent Spell] feat. This does not increase their
level or casting time. At 5th level, you receive a +3 competence
bonus on [Perception] checks that do not rely upon hearing, and
the initiative penalty for being deaf is reduced to -2. At 10th
level, you gain scent and you do not suffer any penalty on
initiative checks due to being deaf. At 15th level, you gain
tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.

*Haunted*: Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing
minor mishaps and strange occurrences (such as unexpected
breezes, small objects moving on their own, and faint
noises). Retrieving any stored item from your gear requires a
standard action, unless it would normally take longer. Any item
you drop lands 10 feet away from you in a random direction. Add
*[mage hand]* and *[ghost sound]* to your list of spells
known. At 5th level, add *[levitate]* and *[minor image]* to your
list of spells known. At 10th level, add *[telekinesis]* to your
list of spells known. At 15th level, add *[reverse gravity]* to
your list of spells known.

*Lame*: One of your legs is permanently wounded, reducing your
base land speed by 10 feet if your base speed is 30 feet or
more. If your base speed is less than 30 feet, your speed is
reduced by 5 feet. Your speed is never reduced due to
encumbrance. At 5th level, you are immune to the fatigued
condition (but not exhaustion). At 10th level, your speed is
never reduced by armor. At 15th level, you are immune to the
exhausted condition.

*Tongues*: In times of stress or unease, you speak in
tongues. Pick one of the following languages: Abyssal, Aklo,
Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, or Terran. Whenever you
are in combat, you can only speak and understand the selected
language. This does not interfere with spellcasting, but it does
apply to spells that are language dependent.  You gain the
selected language as a bonus language. At 5th level, pick an
additional language to speak in combat and add it to your list of
known languages. At 10th level, you can understand any spoken
language, as if under the effects of *[tongues],*even during
combat. At 15th level, you can speak and understand any language,
but your speech is still restricted during combat.

*Wasting*: Your body is slowly rotting away. You take a -4
penalty on Charisma-based skill checks, except for
[Intimidate]. You gain a +4 competence bonus on saves made
against disease. At 5th level, you are immune to the sickened
condition (but not nauseated). At 10th level, you gain immunity
to disease. At 15th level, you are immune to the nauseated
condition.

**Orisons**: Oracles learn a number of orisons, or 0-level
spells, as noted on Table 2-6 under “Spells Known.” These spells
are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots
and may be used again.

**Revelation**: At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels
thereafter (7th, 11th, and so on), an oracle uncovers a new
secret about her mystery that grants her powers and
abilities. The oracle must select a revelation from the list of
revelations available to her mystery. If a revelation is chosen
at a later level, the oracle gains all of the abilities and
bonuses granted by that revelation based on her current
level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a
revelation is a standard action.

**Final Revelation**: At 20th level, an oracle learns the final
revelation about her mystery, granting her amazing powers and
abilities.  The nature of these bonuses depends upon the oracle's
mystery.


### Mysteries

Each oracle must choose from among the following
mysteries. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these
revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the oracle's level + the
oracle's Charisma modifier. Spells marked with an asterisk (\*)
appear in Chapter 5 of this book.

#### Battle

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the battle mystery adds
[Intimidate], [Knowledge] (engineering), [Perception], and [Ride]

*might]* (10th), *[mass bull's strength]* (12th), *[control
*weather]* (14th), [earthquake]* (16th), *[storm of vengeance]*
*(18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the battle mystery can choose
from any of the following revelations.

*Battlecry (Ex)*: As a standard action, you can unleash an
inspiring battlecry. All allies within 100 feet who hear your cry
gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving
throws for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At
10th level, this bonus increases to +2. You can use this ability
once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and
for every five levels thereafter.

*Battlefield Clarity (Ex)*: Once per day, as an immediate action,
whenever you fail a saving throw that causes you to become blind,
deaf, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned, you
may attempt that saving throw again, with a +4 insight bonus on
the roll. You must take the second result, even if it is
worse. At 7th and 15th level, you can use this ability one
additional time per day.

*Combat Healer (Su)*: Whenever you cast a cure spell (a spell
with “cure” in its name), you can cast it as a swift action, as
if using the [Quicken Spell] feat, by expending two spell
slots. This does not increase the level of the spell. You can use
this ability once per day at 7th level and one additional time
per day for every four levels beyond 7th. You must be at least
7th level to select this revelation.

*Iron Skin (Su)*: Once per day, your skin hardens and takes on
the appearance of iron, granting you DR 10/adamantine. This
functions as *[stoneskin]*, using your oracle level as the caster
level. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You
must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

*Maneuver Mastery (Ex)*: Select one type of combat maneuver. When
performing the selected maneuver, you treat your oracle level as
your base attack bonus (plus the BAB from other classes) when
determining your CMB. At 7th level, you gain the Improved feat
(such as [Improved Trip]) that grants you a bonus when performing
that maneuver. At 11th level, you gain the Greater feat (such as
[Greater Trip]) that grants you a bonus when performing that
maneuver. You do not need to meet the prerequisites to receive
these feats.

*Resiliency (Ex)*: You are not disabled and you do not gain the
staggered condition if you are reduced to exactly 0 hit
points. At 7th level, you gain [Diehard] as a bonus feat. At 11th
level, you do not lose a hit point when you take a standard
action while disabled. You do not need to meet the prerequisite
to receive the [Diehard] feat.

*Skill at Arms (Ex)*: You gain proficiency in all martial weapons
and heavy armor.

*Surprising Charge (Ex)*: Once per day, you can move up to your
speed as an immediate action. You can use this ability one
additional time per day at 7th level and 15th level.

*War Sight (Su)*: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll
twice and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in
the surprise round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act
last, regardless of your initiative result (you act in the normal
order in following rounds). At 11th level, you can roll for
initiative three times and take any one of the results.

*Weapon Mastery (Ex)*: Select one weapon with which you are
proficient.  You gain [Weapon Focus] with that weapon. At 8th
level, you gain [Improved Critical] with that weapon. At 12th
level, you gain [Greater Weapon Focus] with that weapon. You do
not need to meet the prerequisites to receive these feats.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become an
avatar of battle. You can take a full-attack action and move up
to your speed as a full-round action (you can move before or
after the attacks). Whenever you score a critical hit, you can
ignore any DR the target might possess. You gain a +4 insight
bonus to your AC for the purpose of confirming critical hits
against you. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die
until your negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution
score.

#### Bones


**Class Skills**: An oracle with a bones mystery adds [Bluff],
[Disguise], [Intimidate], and [Stealth] to her list of class
skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Cause Fear]*(2nd), *[False Life]* (4th),
  *[Animate Dead]* (6th), *[Fear]*(8th), *[Slay Living]* (10th),
  *[Circle of Death]* (12th), *[Control Undead]* (14th), *[Horrid
  Wilting]*(16th), *[Wail of the Banshee]* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the bones mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Armor of Bones (Su)*: You can conjure armor made of bones that
grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor
grants you DR 5/bludgeoning. You can use this armor for 1 hour
per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Bleeding Wounds (Su)*: Whenever a creature takes damage from one
of your spells or effects that causes negative energy damage
(such as *[inflict light wounds]* or the death's touch
revelation), it begins to bleed, taking 1 point of damage each
round. At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, this
damage increases by 1. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15
[Heal] check or any effect that heals damage.

*Death's Touch (Su)*: You can cause terrible wounds to appear on
a creature with a melee touch attack. This attack deals 1d6
points of negative energy damage +1 point for every two oracle
levels you possess.  If used against an undead creature, it heals
damage and grants a +2 channel resistance for 1 minute. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Charisma modifier.

*Near Death (Su)*: You gain a +2 insight bonus on saves against
diseases, mind-affecting effects, and poisons. At 7th level, this
bonus also applies on saves against death effects, sleep effects,
and stunning. At 11th level, the bonus increases to +4.

*Raise the Dead (Su)*: As a standard action, you can summon a
single skeleton or zombie to serve you. The undead creature has a
number of Hit Dice equal to your oracle level. It remains for a
number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At 7th level,
you can summon a bloody skeleton or fast zombie. At 15th level,
you can summon an advanced skeleton or zombie. You can use this
ability once per day plus one additional time per day at 10th
level.

*Resist Life (Su)*: You are treated as an undead creature when
you are targeted by positive or negative energy. You are not
subject to [Turn Undead] or [Command Undead] (or any other effect
that specifically targets undead), unless you are actually an
undead creature. At 7th level, you receive channel resistance
+2. This bonus increases by +2 at 11th and 15th level.

*Soul Siphon (Su)*: As a ranged touch attack, you can unleash a
ray that causes a target to gain one negative level. The ray has
a range of 30 feet. This negative level lasts for a number of
minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. Whenever this ability
gives a target a negative level, you heal a number of hit points
equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability once per
day, plus one additional time at 11th level and every four levels
thereafter. You must be at least 7th level to select this
revelation.

*Spirit Walk (Su)*: As a standard action, you can become
incorporeal and invisible. While in this form, you can move in
any direction and through any object (except for those made of
force). You can take no action other than to move while in this
form. You remain in this form for a number of rounds equal to
your oracle level, but you can end this effect prematurely with a
standard action. You can use this ability once per day at 11th
level, and twice per day at 15th level. You must be at least 11th
level to select this revelation.

*Undead Servitude (Su)*: You gain [Command Undead] as a bonus
feat. You can channel negative energy a number of times per day
equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier, but only to use [Command
Undead]. You can take other feats to add to this ability, such as
Improved Channeling, but not feats that alter this ability, such
as [Alignment Channel].

*Voice of the Grave (Su)*: You can *[speak with dead]*, as per
the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle
level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. At 5th level,
and every five levels thereafter, the dead creature takes a
cumulative -2 penalty on its Will save to resist this effect.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
master of death. Once per round, you can cast *[bleed]* or
*[stabilize]*as a free action.  If you are brought to below 0 hit
points, you automatically stabilize.  You can cast *[animate
dead]* at will without paying a material component cost (although
you are still subject to the usual Hit Die control limit). Once
per day, you can cast *[power word kill]*, but the spell can
target a creature with 150 hit points or less.

Flame -----

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the flame mystery adds
[Acrobatics], [Climb], [Intimidate], and [Perform] to her list of
class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Burning Hands]*(2nd), *[Resist Energy]*(4th),
  *[Fireball]*(6th), *[Wall of Fire]*(8th), *[Summon Monster V]*
  (Fire Elementals Only, 10th), *[Fire Seeds]*(12th), *[Fire
  Storm]*(14th), *[Incendiary Cloud]*(16th), *[Fiery
  Body]\**(18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with a flame mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Burning Magic (Su)*: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw
and takes fire damage from one of your spells, it catches on
fire. This fire deals 1 point of fire damage per spell level at
the beginning of the burning creature's turn. The fire lasts for
1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action if the
creature succeeds at a Reflex save (using the spell's
DC). Dousing the creature with water as a standard action grants
a +2 bonus on this save, while immersing the creature in water
automatically extinguishes the fire. Spells that do not grant a
save do not cause a creature to catch on fire.

*Cinder Dance (Ex)*: Your base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th
level, you receive [Nimble Moves] as a bonus feat. At 10th level,
you receive [Acrobatic Steps] as a bonus feat. You do not need to
meet the prerequisites to receive these feats. Oracles with the
lame oracle curse cannot select this revelation.

*Fire Breath (Su)*: As a standard action, you can unleash a
15-foot cone of flame from your mouth. This flame deals 1d4
points of fire damage per level. A Reflex save halves this
damage. You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels
thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.

*Firestorm (Su)*: As a standard action, you can cause fire to
erupt around you. You can create one 10-foot cube of fire per
oracle level.  These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you
desire, but each cube must be adjacent to another and one must be
adjacent to you. Any creature caught in these flames takes 1d6
points of fire damage per oracle level, with a Reflex save
resulting in half damage. This fire lasts for a number of rounds
equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability once
per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this
revelation.

*Form of Flame (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume the
form of a Small fire elemental, as *[elemental body I]*. At 9th
level, you can assume the form of a Medium fire elemental, as
*[elemental body II]*. At 11th level, you can assume the form of
a Large fire elemental, as *[elemental body III]*. At 13th level,
you can assume the form of a Huge fire elemental, as *[elemental
body IV]*. You can use this ability once per day, but the
duration is 1 hour/level. You must be at least 7th level to
select this revelation.

*Gaze of Flames (Su)*: You can see through fire, fog, and smoke
without penalty as long as the light is sufficient to allow you
to see normally.  At 7th level, you can gaze through any source
of flame within 10 feet per oracle level, as if using
*clairvoyance*. You can use this ability for a number of rounds
per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need
to be consecutive.

*Heat Aura (Su)*: As a swift action, you can cause waves of heat
to radiate from your body. This heat deals 1d4 points of fire
damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d4) to all creatures
within 10 feet. A Reflex save halves the damage. In addition,
your form wavers and blurs, granting you 20% concealment until
your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels
thereafter.

*Molten Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist fire 5. This resistance
increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level,
you gain immunity to fire.

*Touch of Flame (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a
melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of fire damage +1 point
for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability
a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At
11th level, any weapon that you wield is treated as a
*[flaming]*weapon.

*Wings of Fire (Su)*: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair
of fiery wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with average
maneuverability. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per
oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but
it must be spent in 1 minute increments. You must be at least 7th
level before selecting this revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
master of fire. You can apply any one of the following feats to
any fire spell you cast without increasing the level or casting
time: [Enlarge Spell], [Extend Spell], [Silent Spell], or [Still
Spell]. You do not need to possess these feats to use this
ability.


#### Heavens

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the heavens mystery adds [Fly],
[Knowledge] (arcana), [Perception], and [Survival] to her list of
class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Color Spray]* (2nd), *[Hypnotic Pattern]*
  (4th), *[Daylight]* (6th), *[Rainbow Pattern]* (8th),
  *[Overland Flight]* (10th), *[Chain Lightning]* (12th),
  *[Prismatic Spray]* (14th), *[Sunburst]* (16th), *[Meteor
  Swarm]* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the heavens mystery can choose
from any of the following revelations.

*Awesome Display (Su)*: Your phantasmagoric displays accurately
model the mysteries of the night sky, dumbfounding all who behold
them. Each creature affected by your illusion (pattern) spells is
treated as if its total number of Hit Dice were equal to its
number of Hit Dice minus your Charisma modifier (if positive).

*Coat of Many Stars (Su)*: You conjure a coat of starry radiance
that grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four
levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level,
this armor grants you DR 5/slashing. You can use this coat for 1
hour per day per oracle level. The duration does not need to be
consecutive; it can instead be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Dweller in [Darkness] (Sp)*: Once per day, you cast your psyche
into the void of space to attract the attention of a terrible
otherworldly being. The dweller in darkness behaves in all ways
as if you had cast *[phantasmal killer]*. At 17th level, the
dweller in darkness can be perceived by more than one creature,
as if you had cast *[weird]*.  You must be at least 11th level to
choose this revelation.

*Guiding Star (Su)*: Whenever you can see the open sky at night,
you can determine your precise location. When the night sky is
visible to you, you may also add your Charisma modifier to your
Wisdom modifier on all Wisdom-based checks. In addition, once per
night while outdoors, you can cast one spell as if it were
modified by the [Empower Spell], [Extend Spell], [Silent Spell],
or Still spell feat without increasing the spell's casting time
or level.

*Interstellar Void (Su)*: You call upon the frigid depths of
outer space to bring a terrible chill to your enemies. As a
standard action, one target within 30 feet is cloaked in the void
and takes 1d6 points of cold damage per level. A successful
Fortitude save halves this damage.  At 10th level, the
interstellar void is so extreme that enemies who fail their
saving throw are fatigued. At 15th level, creatures who fail
their save are exhausted and stunned for 1 round. You can use
this ability once per day plus one additional time per day at
10th level.

*Lure of the Heavens (Su)*: Your connection to the skies above is
so strong that your feet barely touch the ground. At 1st level,
you no longer leave tracks. At 5th level, you can hover up to 6
inches above the ground or even above liquid surfaces, as if
levitating. At 10th level, you gain the ability to *[fly]*, as
per the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to your
oracle level.  This duration does not need to be consecutive, but
it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

*Mantle of Moonlight (Su)*: Your innate understanding of the moon
renders you immune to lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt
a lycanthrope's connection to the moon with a successful touch
attack.  This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into
its humanoid form, which it must remain in for a number of rounds
equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use
this ability to force others into a *[rage]*, as per the
spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack. You can use
this ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time
per day for every 5 levels above 5th.

*Moonlight Bridge (Su)*: You summon a bridge of shimmering
moonlight.  The 10-foot-wide span touches the ground at a point
adjacent to your position. From this point it can extend in any
direction for 10 feet per oracle level. The path persists until
you have crossed over the bridge or for 24 hours, whichever is
shorter. You may summon a moonlight bridge a number of times per
day equal to your Charisma bonus. Should the bridge be attacked,
treat it as a *[wall of force]*.

*Spray of Shooting Stars (Su):* As a standard action, you can
unleash a ball of energy that explodes in a 5-foot-radius burst
dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per level. A successful Reflex
save halves this damage.  This attack has a range of 60 feet. You
can fire one explosive ball per day, plus one additional ball per
day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter. You can fire
more than one ball at a time, but creatures caught inside more
than one simultaneous explosions only take damage once.

*Star Chart (Ex)*: Your copious notes contain a working model of
the night sky expressed in artistic scribbles and arcane
mathematical formulae. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes
contemplating your star chart to gain the benefit of the spell
*[commune]*. You must be at least 7th level to select this
revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon achieving 20th level, your rapport
with the heavens grants you perfect harmony with the
universe. You receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your
Charisma modifier. You automatically stabilize if you are below 0
hit points, are immune to fear effects, and automatically confirm
all critical hits. Should you die, you are reborn 3 days later in
the form of a star child, who matures over the course of 7 days
(treat as the *[reincarnate]* spell).


#### Life

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the life mystery adds [Handle
Animal], [Knowledge] (nature), and [Survival] to her list of
class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Detect Undead]* (2nd), *[Lesser Restoration]*
  (4th), *[Neutralize Poison]* (6th), *[Restoration]* (8th),
  *[Breath of Life]* (10th), *[Heal]* (12th), *[Greater
  Restoration]* (14th), *[Mass Heal]* (16th), *[True
  Resurrection]* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the life mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Channel (Su)*: You can channel positive energy like a cleric,
using your oracle level as your effective cleric level when
determining the amount of damage healed (or caused to undead) and
the DC. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal
to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

*Combat Healer (Su)*: As the battle mystery revelation.

*Delay Affliction (Su)*: Once per day as an immediate action,
whenever you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison, you
may ignore its effects for 1 hour per level. At 7th and 15th
level, you can use this ability one additional time per day.

*Energy Body (Su)*: As a standard action, you can transform your
body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire
elemental. In this form, you gain the elemental subtype and give
off a warm, welcoming light that increases the light level within
10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead creature
striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal
damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of
positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level.  Creatures
wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage
if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature
using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this
damage in place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per
round, if you pass through a living allied creature's square or
the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1
per oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a
move action. You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it
passes through your space. You may return to your normal form as
a free action. You may remain in energy body form for a number of
rounds per day equal to your oracle level.

*Enhanced Cures (Su)*: Whenever you cast a cure spell, the
maximum number of hit points healed is based on your oracle
level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an
11th-level oracle of life with this revelation may cast *[cure
light wounds]* to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal
1d8+5 maximum.

*Healing Hands (Ex)*: You gain a +4 bonus on [Heal] checks. You
may provide first aid to two people or treat two people for
poison as a standard action (make a separate [Heal] check for
each creature). When using the [Heal] skill to treat wounds from
caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat
disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the normal
number of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide
long-term care for yourself.

*Life Link (Su)*: As a standard action, you may create a bond
between yourself and another creature. Each round at the start of
your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit
points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and
you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per
oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies,
you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds
medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have
multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of
the same immediate action).

*Lifesense (Su)*: You notice and locate living creatures within
30 feet, just as if you possessed the blindsight ability. You
must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

*Safe Curing (Su)*: Whenever you cast a spell that cures the
target of hit point damage, you do not provoke attacks of
opportunity for spellcasting.

*Spirit Boost (Su)*: Whenever your healing spells heal a target
up to its maximum hit points, any excess points persist for 1
round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number
of temporary hit points equal to your oracle level).

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
perfect channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed,
death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative
levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain cannot
reduce you below 1 in any ability score. You automatically make
saving throws against massive damage. When you are below 0 hit
points, you do not die until your negative total is in excess of
twice your Constitution score.


#### Lore

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the lore mystery adds [Appraise]
and all [Knowledge] skills to her list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Identify]* (2nd), *[Tongues]* (4th), *[Locate
  Object]*(6th), *[Legend Lore]* (8th), *[Contact Other Plane]*
  (10th), *[Mass Owl's Wisdom]* (12th), *[Vision]* (14th),
  *[Moment Of Prescience]* (16th), *[Time Stop]* (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the lore mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Arcane Archivist (Su)*: Your experience with lore-filled tomes
has granted you the ability to cast arcane spells as if they were
on your spell list. Once per day, you can cast a spell from the
sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on your list of spells
known. The spell consumes a spell slot one level higher than the
level of the spell. You must have a spellbook containing the
spell to cast it in this way, and the spell is erased when you
complete the casting. You must be at least 11th level to select
this revelation.

*Automatic Writing (Su)*: Once per day, you can spend a full hour
in uninterrupted meditation. During this period, your hands
produce mysterious writing that pertains to the future. At 1st
level, the prophetic writing manifests as an *[augury]* spell
with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, the writing takes the form
of a *[divination]* with 90% effectiveness. At 8th level, the
writing manifests as a casting of *[commune]* with no material
component required.

*Brain Drain (Su)*: You can take a standard action to violently
probe the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The
target receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately
knows the source of this harmful mental prying. Those who fail
this save are wracked with pain, taking 1d4 points of damage per
oracle level. After successfully attacking with this ability, you
may use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen
thoughts and memories to make a single [Knowledge] check using
the victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in
your mind for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma
modifier. Treat the knowledge gained as if you used *[detect
thoughts]*. This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this
ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per
day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th.

*Focused Trance (Ex)*: You can enter a deep meditation, blocking
out visual and auditory stimuli and allowing you to concentrate
on a single problem, philosophical issue, or memory. This trance
lasts 1d6 rounds, during which time you can only take move
actions. During this period, you gain a bonus equal to your level
on all saves against sonic effects and gaze attacks. When you
come out of your trance, you may make a single Intelligence-based
skill check with a +20 circumstance bonus. You may enter your
focused trance a number of times per day equal to your Charisma
modifier.

*Lore Keeper (Ex)*: Instead of encyclopedic knowledge, you learn
most of your information through tales, songs, and poems. You may
use your Charisma modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier
on all [Knowledge] checks.

*Mental Acuity (Ex)*: Your explorations into the secret mysteries
of the world have granted you a preternatural understanding of
all things-and you just keep getting smarter. You gain a +1
inherent bonus to Intelligence upon taking this revelation and
another at every third oracle level gained thereafter. You must
be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

*[Sidestep]) Secret (Su)*: Your innate understanding of the
universe has granted you preternatural reflexes and the uncanny
ability to step out of danger at the very last second. Add your
Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to your
Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum
Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your
Dexterity.

*Spontaneous Symbology*: Your knowledge of the secret history of
the world has unveiled the mysterious symbols that govern
reality. You can cast any “symbol” spell using a spell slot of
the appropriate level, even if the spell is not on your list of
spells known. A symbol spell is any spell with the word “symbol”
in its name. You must be at least 11th level to select this
revelation.

*Think On It (Ex)*: Once per day, the oracle of lore can
re-attempt any previously failed [Knowledge] check. On this
attempt, add a +10 competence bonus on the check.

*[Whirlwind] Lesson (Ex)*: You can quickly browse through a
magical tome or manual, gaining its benefits with only a single
8-hour study session (rather than the usual 48 hours over a
period of 6 days). At 7th level, you may allow another character
to join in your study; both of you gain the full benefit of
having read the book. At 15th level, you may share your whirlwind
lesson with a number of characters equal to your oracle
level. The benefits to you are permanent, whereas your students
gain the tome or manual's benefits for a number of days equal to
your Charisma modifier but then forget what they have learned.

**Final Revelation**: You gain the ability to take 20 on all
[Knowledge] skill checks. Your understanding of the fundamental
underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that once
per day, you can cast *[wish]*. This ability does not require a
material component, but the *[wish]*cannot be used to grant
ability score bonuses, nor can it be used to replicate spells
with expensive material components.


#### Nature

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the nature mystery adds [Climb],
[Fly], [Knowledge] (nature), [Ride], [Survival], and [Swim] to
her list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Charm Animal]* (2nd), *[Barkskin]* (4th),
  *[Speak with Plants]* (6th), *[Grove of Respite]\** (8th),
  *[Awaken]* (10th), *[Stone Tell]* (12th), *[Creeping Doom]*
  (14th), *[Animal Shapes]* (16th), *[World Wave]\** (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the nature mystery can choose
from any of the following revelations.

*Bonded [Mount] (Su)*: You gain the service of an unusually
intelligent, strong, and loyal mount. The creature must be one
that you are capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A
Medium oracle can select a camel or a horse. A Small oracle can
select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she
is at least 4th level. This mount functions as a druid's animal
companion, using your oracle level as your effective druid
level. Bonded mounts have an Intelligence score of at least 6.

*Erosion Touch (Su)*: As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1d6
points of damage per level to objects or constructs. If used
against an object in another creature's possession, treat this
attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once
per day, plus one time per day for every three levels you
possess.

*Friend to the Animals (Ex)*: Add all *summon nature's ally*
spells to your spell list. You must still select these spells
using your allotment of spells known. Animals within 30 feet of
you receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma
modifier.

*Life Leach (Su)*: You can draw life force from the bodies of
enemies and channel it into yourself. As a standard action, you
can drain the life essence from one living target within 30
feet. The target takes 1d6 points of damage per two levels you
possess (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to
the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the target's
current hit points + the target's Constitution score (which is
enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points last a
number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The target
receives a Fortitude save to halve the damage (and the temporary
hit points you gain). You may use this ability once per day at
7th level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels
you possess beyond 7th. You must be at least 7th level before
selecting this revelation.

*Natural Divination (Ex)*: You can read the entrails of a freshly
killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight bonus equal to your
Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by
observing and interpreting the flights of birds, you may apply a
+10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, by charting
marks in dirt or stone, or observing the behavior of sand when
thrown into the wind, you gain a +4 insight bonus on one
initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24
hours and you must declare you are using the bonus before the
check or save is made. Making a natural divination takes 10
minutes.  You may use natural divination (in any combination)
once per day plus one additional time per day for every four
oracle levels you have attained.

*Nature's Whispers (Ex)*: You have become so attuned to the
whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the
groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly
keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your
Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your
Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose
your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to
lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.

*Speak with Animals (Ex)*: Choose a specific kind of animal
(eagle, fox, dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse
with that type of animal as if you were under the effects of
*speak with animal*. You gain the ability to communicate with an
additional kind of animal for every 3 oracle levels you have
attained.

*Spirit of Nature (Su)*: When in a natural setting, whenever you
are reduced to negative hit points, you automatically
stabilize. At 5th level, you gain fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds
whenever you are reduced to negative hit points. At 10th level,
the ability works everywhere, even in civilized or wholly
artificial realms. At 15th level, you gain fast healing 3 for 1d4
rounds when reduced to negative hit points.

*Transcendental Bond (Su)*: You become so attuned to the common
spirit shared by all living things that you can use it to
communicate with allies. You may communicate with your allies for
a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level as if using
*[telepathic bond]*. You may designate a number of creatures as
your ally equal to your Charisma modifier. Designating a creature
is a standard action that requires a touch. At 10th level, you
may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a designated ally once
per day.

*Undo Artifice (Sp)*: At 11th-level, you gain the ability to
reduce a nonliving item to its component parts, essentially
erasing the hand of artifice and rendering the item into a pile
of raw natural materials.  This effect acts as the spell
*[polymorph any object]*, working on both magical and nonmagical
nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike
*[polymorph any object]*, it cannot be used to mimic the effects
of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude
saving throw to negate the effect. Magic items receive a
circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp in
the item's value. You may use undo artifice a number of times per
day equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Final Revelation**: At 20th level, you have discovered the
intrinsic secrets of life itself, granting you incredible control
over your own body. Once per day, you can surround yourself with
an organic cocoon as a full-round action. While enclosed in the
cocoon, you are considered helpless. Eight hours later, you
emerge having changed your type to plant, animal, or humanoid,
gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate (see
the *PF RPG Bestiary*). This change does not alter your
Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills,
or proficiencies. Each time the transformation is made, you are
cleansed of all poisons or diseases, are restored to full hit
points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a new type
every time the transformation is made.


#### Stone

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the stone mystery adds
[Appraise], [Climb], [Intimidate], and [Survival] to her list of
class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Magic Stone]* (2nd), *[Stone Call]\** (4th),
  *[Meld into Stone]* (6th), *[Wall of Stone]* (8th),
  *[Stoneskin]* (10th), *[Stone Tell]* (12th), *[Statue]* (14th),
  *[Repel Metal or Stone]* (16th), *[Clashing Rocks]\** (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the stone mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Acid Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist acid 5. This resistance
increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level,
you gain immunity to acid.

*Clobbering Strike (Ex)*: Whenever you score a critical hit
against an opponent with a spell that requires an attack roll,
you may immediately attempt to trip your opponent as a swift
action. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity as normal for
this trip attempt. You cannot be tripped in return when using
this ability.

*Crystal Sight (Ex)*: You can see through stone, earth, or sand
as easily as if it were transparent crystal. Your gaze can
penetrate a number of feet equal to your oracle level, or 1/12th
this thickness of metal. You can use this ability a number of
rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do
not need to be consecutive.

*Earth [Glide] (Su)*: You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost
any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily
as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage,
you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land
speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do
not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no
tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your
presence. A *[move earth]* spell cast on an area where you are
flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you
succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a
free action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level
to select this revelation. You can bring other creatures with you
when you glide, but each passenger costs an additional minute per
minute of travel.

*Mighty Pebble (Su)*: As a standard action, you can charge and
throw a pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates
when it strikes a target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a
range increment of 20 feet and has a +1 enhancement bonus to
attack and damage for every four oracle levels you possess. Any
creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning
damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures
in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage
if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses,
treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it
lands.  You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels
thereafter.

*Rock [Throwing] (Ex)*: You are an accomplished rock thrower and
have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks. You can
hurl rocks up to two categories smaller than your own size. The
range increment for a rock is 20 feet, and you can hurl it up to
5 range increments. Damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a Medium
creature or 2d3 for a Small creature, plus 1-1/2 your Strength
bonus.

*Shard Explosion (Su)*: As a swift action, you can cause jagged
pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards
deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum
1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save
halves this damage. In addition, the broken shards make the area
difficult terrain until your next turn.  You can use this ability
once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and
every five levels thereafter.

*Steelbreaker Skin (Su)*: As a standard action, you can harden
your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or
destroyed. Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the
weapon takes an amount of damage equal to your oracle level. This
ability does not prevent the weapon from harming you unless the
damage destroys the weapon attacking you. You can use this
ability once per day, but the duration is 1 minute/level. You
must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.  At 15th
level, the damage from this ability ignores up to 10 points of
hardness.

*Stone Stability (Ex)*: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat
Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt while
standing on the ground. At 5th level, you gain [Improved Trip] as
a bonus feat. At 10th level, you gain [Greater Trip] as a bonus
feat.  You do not need to meet the prerequisites to gain these
feats.

*Touch of Acid (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a
melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of acid damage +1 point
for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use this ability
a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At
11th level, any weapon that you wield deals +1d6 points of acid
damage, similar to how a *[flaming]* weapon operates.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
master of acid and earth. You can apply any one of the following
feats to any acid or earth spell without increasing the level or
casting time: [Enlarge Spell], [Extend Spell], [Silent Spell], or
[Still Spell].


#### Waves

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the waves mystery adds
[Acrobatics], [Escape Artist], [Knowledge] (nature), and [Swim]
to her list of class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Touch of the Sea]\** (2nd), *[Slipstream]\**
  (4th), *[Water Breathing]*(6th), *[Wall of Ice]* (8th),
  *[Geyser]\** (10th), *[Fluid Form]\** (12th), *[Vortex]\**
  (14th), *[Seamantle]\** (16th), *[Tsunami]\** (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the waves mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Blizzard (Su)*: As a standard action, you can create a blizzard
of snow and ice. You can create one 10-foot-cube of storm per
oracle level.  These cubes can be arranged in any pattern you
desire, but each cube must be adjacent to another and one must be
adjacent to you. Any creature caught in the blizzard takes 1d4
points of cold damage per oracle level, with a Reflex save
resulting in half damage. The storm lasts for a number of rounds
equal to your Charisma modifier; the ground remains icy (+5 to
[Acrobatics] DCs) as long as local conditions permit. The
blizzard obscures sight beyond 5 feet, providing total
concealment. A creature within 5 feet has concealment.  You can
use this ability once per day. You must be 11th level to select
this revelation.

*Fluid Nature (Ex)*: You receive a +4 bonus to your Combat
Maneuver Defense against bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition,
and trip attempts.  A creature trying to confirm a critical hit
against you has a -4 penalty on its confirmation roll. At 5th
level, you gain [Dodge] as a bonus feat. You do not need to meet
the prerequisite to gain this feat.

*Fluid Travel (Su)*: You can walk on liquid as if it were a solid
surface. Walking on the liquid does not harm you; you can walk on
acid or even lava (as if walking on a solid temporary crust),
though you would still take fire damage from being near the
lava. You can move across this surface at your normal land
speed. At 7th level, while this ability is in effect, you can
instead go underwater, gaining a swim speed of 60 feet and the
ability to breathe water. You can use this ability for 1 hour per
day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Freezing Spells (Su)*: Whenever a creature fails a saving throw
and takes cold damage from one of your spells, it is slowed (as
the *[slow]* spell) for 1 round. Spells that do not allow a save
do not slow creatures. At 11th level, the duration increases to
1d4 rounds.

*Ice Armor (Su)*: You can conjure armor of ice that grants you a
+4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter,
this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you
DR 5/piercing. In cold conditions, the armor bonus (and DR bonus)
increases by 2; in very hot conditions it decreases by 2. You can
use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration
does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour
increments.

*Icy Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist cold 5. This resistance
increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At 17th level,
you gain immunity to cold.

*Punitive [Transformation] (Su)*: You can transform an opponent
into a harmless animal as if using *[baleful polymorph]*. This
transformation lasts 1 round per oracle level. Transforming
another creature causes the first to immediately revert to
normal. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal
to your Charisma modifier.  You must be at least 7th level before
selecting this revelation.

*Water Form (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume the form
of a Small water elemental, as *[elemental body I]*. At 9th
level, you can assume the form of a Medium water elemental, as
*[elemental body II]*. At 11th level, you can assume the form of
a Large water elemental, as *[elemental body III]*. At 13th
level, you can assume the form of a Huge water elemental, as
*[elemental body IV]*. You can use this ability once per day, but
the duration is 1 hour/level. You must be at least 7th level to
select this revelation.

*Water Sight (Su)*: You can see through fog and mist without
penalty as long as there is enough light to allow you to see
normal. At 7th level, you can use any calm pool of water at least
1 foot in diameter as a scrying device, as if using the *scry*
spell. At 15th level, this functions like *[greater scrying]*.You
can use the scrying abilities for a number of rounds per day
equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be
consecutive.

*Wintry Touch (Su)*: As a standard action, you can perform a
melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point
for every two oracle levels you possess. You can use the wintry
touch ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield is
treated as a *[frost]* weapon.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
master of cold and water. You can apply any one of the following
feats to any cold or water spell without increasing the level or
casting time: [Enlarge Spell], [Extend Spell], [Silent Spell], or
[Still Spell].


#### Wind

**Class Skills**: An oracle with the wind mystery adds
[Acrobatics], [Escape Artist], [Fly], and [Stealth] to her list
of class skills.

**Bonus Spells**: *[Alter Winds]\** (2nd), *[Gust of Wind]*
  (4th), *[Cloak of Winds]\** (6th), *[River of Wind]\** (8th),
  *[Control Winds]* (10th), *[Sirocco]\**(12th), *[Control
  Weather]* (14th), *[Whirlwind]* (16th), *[Winds of
  Vengeance]\** (18th).

**Revelations**: An oracle with the wind mystery can choose from
any of the following revelations.

*Air Barrier (Ex)*: You can create an invisible shell of air that
grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels
thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this
barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks
requiring an attack roll against you to have a 50% miss
chance. You can use this barrier for 1 hour per day per oracle
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Gaseous Form (Su)*: As a standard action, you can assume
*[gaseous form]* (as the spell). You can remain gaseous for 1
minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to
be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. You
must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.  You can
bring other creatures with you in gaseous form, but each
passenger costs an additional minute per minute of travel.

*[Invisibility] (Su)*: As a standard action, you can become
invisible (as per the *[invisibility]*spell).  You can remain
invisible for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration
does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute
increments. Starting at 9th level, each time you activate this
ability you can treat it as *[greater invisibility]*, though each
round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your
normal*[invisibility]* duration. You must be at least 3rd level
to select this revelation.

*Lightning Breath (Su)*: As a standard action, you can breathe a
30-foot line of electricity. This line deals 1d4 points of
electricity damage per oracle level. A Reflex save halves this
damage. You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels
thereafter.

*[Spark] Skin (Ex)*: You gain resist electricity 5. This
resistance increases to 10 at 5th level and 20 at 11th level. At
17th level, you gain immunity to electricity.

*Thunderburst (Ex)*: As a standard action, you can create a blast
of air accompanied by a loud peal of thunder. The blast has a
range of 100 feet and has a 20-foot radius, increasing by 5 feet
for every 4 oracle levels after 7th. Creatures in the area take
1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per oracle level and are
deafened for 1 hour, with a Fortitude save resulting in half
damage and no deafness. You must be at least 7th level to select
this revelation. You can use this ability once per day, plus one
additional time per day at 11th level and every four levels
thereafter.

*Touch of Electricity (Su)*: As a standard action, you can
perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of electricity
damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. You can
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your
Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield is
treated as a *[shock]* weapon.

*[Vortex] Spells (Ex)*: Whenever you score a critical hit against
an opponent with an attack spell, the target is staggered for 1
round. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.

*Wind Sight (Ex)*: You ignore penalties on [Perception] checks
based on wind and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level,
as a standard action, you can see and hear into any area (as if
using *clairaudience* and *clairvoyance*) within range as long as
there is an unobstructed path for air to travel between you and
the target area (this does not require line of effect, meaning
the path can turn corners and go through spaces no smaller than 1
inch in diameter). You can use this ability a number of rounds
per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need
to be consecutive.

*Wings of Air (Su)*: As a swift action, you can manifest a pair
of translucent, cloud-like wings that grant you a fly speed of 60
feet with good maneuverability. At 10th level, your speed
increases to 90 feet and your maneuverability increases to
perfect. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day per oracle
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
be spent in 1-minute increments. You must be at least 7th level
to select this revelation.

**Final Revelation**: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a
master of air and electricity. You can apply any one of the
following feats to any air or electricity spell without
increasing the level or casting time: [Enlarge Spell], [Extend
Spell], [Silent Spell], or [Still Spell].


## Summoner

While many who dabble in the arcane become adept at beckoning
monsters from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more
skilled at it than the summoner. This practitioner of the arcane
arts forms a close bond with one particular outsider, known as an
eidolon, who gains power as the summoner becomes more proficient
at his summoning. Over time, the two become linked, eventually
even sharing a shard of the same soul. But this power comes with
a price: the summoner's spells and abilities are limited due to
his time spent enhancing the power and exploring the nature of
his eidolon.

**Role**: Summoners spend much of their time exploring the arcane
arts alongside their eidolons. While their power comes from
within, they rely heavily on their eidolon companions in
dangerous situations. While a summoner and his eidolon function
as individuals, their true power lies in what they can accomplish
together.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d8.


### Class Skills

The summoner's class skills are [Craft] (Int), [Fly] (Dex),
[Handle Animal] (Cha), [Knowledge] (all) (Int), [Linguistics]
(Int), [Profession] (Wis), [Ride] (Dex), [Spellcraft] (Int), and
[Use Magic Device] (Cha).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

The following are the class features of the summoner.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Summoners are proficient with
all simple weapons. Summoners are also proficient with light
armor. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light
armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure
chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a summoner wearing
medium or heavy armor, or using a shield, incurs a chance of
arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic
component. A multiclass summoner still incurs the normal arcane
spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other
classes.

**Spells**: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the
summoner spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without
preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his
allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for
a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level
+ the summoner's Charisma modifier.

A summoner can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell
level each day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table
2-7. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a
high Charisma score (see Table 1-3 of the *PF RPG Core
Rulebook*).

A summoner's selection of spells is extremely limited. A summoner
begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells
of the summoner's choice. At each new summoner level, he gains
one or more new spells as indicated on Table 2-8. (Unlike spells
per day, the number of spells a summoner knows is not affected by
his Charisma score. The numbers on Table 2-8 are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third summoner level
thereafter (8th, 11th, and so on), a summoner can choose to learn
a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the
summoner “loses” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The
new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being
exchanged, and it must be at least one level lower than the
highest-level summoner spell he can cast. A summoner may swap out
only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or
not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells
known for the level.

**Cantrips**: A summoner learns a number of cantrips, or 0-level
spells, as noted on Table 2-8 under “Spells Known.” These spells
are cast like any other spell, but they may be cast any number of
times per day.  Cantrips prepared using other spell slots, due to
metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normally.

**Eidolon**: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to
his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms
a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect
of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the
summoner that calls it and can speak all of his
languages. Eidolons are treated as summoned creatures, except
that they are not sent back to their home plane until reduced to
a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than their
Constitution score. In addition, due to its tie to its summoner,
an eidolon can touch and attack creatures warded by *[protection
from evil]* and similar effects that prevent contact with
summoned creatures.

A summoner can summon his eidolon in a ritual that takes 1 minute
to perform. When summoned in this way, the eidolon hit points are
unchanged from the last time it was summoned. The only exception
to this is if the eidolon was slain, in which case it returns
with half its normal hit points. The eidolon does not heal
naturally. The eidolon remains until dismissed by the summoner (a
standard action). If the eidolon is sent back to its home plane
due to death, it cannot be summoned again until the following
day. The eidolon cannot be sent back to its home plane by means
of *[dispel magic]*, but spells such as *[dismissal]*and
*[banishment]* work normally.  If the summoner is unconscious,
asleep, or killed, his eidolon is immediately banished.

The eidolon takes a form shaped by the summoner's desires. The
eidolon's Hit Dice, saving throws, skills, feats, and abilities
are tied to the summoner's class level and increase as the
summoner gains levels. In addition, each eidolon receives a pool
of evolution points, based on the summoner's class level, that
can be used to give the eidolon different abilities and
powers. Whenever the summoner gains a level, he must decide how
these points are spent, and they are set until he gains another
level of summoner.

The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it
always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. This control
is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific
creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing rune that is identical
to a rune that appears on the summoner's forehead as long as the
eidolon is summoned. While this rune can be hidden through
mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes
appearance, such as *[alter self]* or *[polymorph]* (although
*[invisibility]*does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).

**Life Link (Su)**: Starting at 1st level, a summoner forms a
close bond with his eidolon. Whenever the eidolon takes enough
damage to send it back to its home plane, the summoner can, as a
free action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point
sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the
eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its
home plane.

In addition, the eidolon and the summoner must remain within 100
feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at full
strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000
feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by
50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than
10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced
by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is
immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost
in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets closer to its
summoner, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.

***Summon Monster I* (Sp)**: Starting at 1st level, a summoner
can cast *[summon monster I]* as a spell-like ability a number of
times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Drawing upon
this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call
his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his
eidolon is not summoned. He can cast this spell as a standard
action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead
of 1 round per level). At 3rd level, and every 2 levels
thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell
level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a
maximum of *[summon monster IX]* at 17th level).  At 19th level,
this ability can be used as *[gate]* or *[summon monster IX]*. If
used as *[gate]*, the summoner must pay any required material
components. A summoner cannot have more than one summon monster*
or *[gate]*spell active in this way at one time. If this ability
is used again, any existing summon monster* or *[gate]*
immediately ends. These summon spells are considered to be part
of his spell list for the purposes of spell trigger and spell
completion items. In addition, he can expend uses of this ability
to fufill the construction requirements of any magic item he
creates, so long as he can use this ability to cast the required
spell.

**Bond Senses (Su)**: Starting at 2nd level, a summoner can, as a
standard action, share the senses of his eidolon, hearing,
seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the eidolon
does. He can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to
his summoner level.  There is no range to this effect, but the
eidolon and the summoner must be on the same plane. The summoner
can end this effect as a free action.

**Shield Ally (Ex)**: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within
his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to
his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving
throws. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled,
helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.

**Maker's Call (Su)**: At 6th level, as a standard action, a
summoner can call his eidolon to his side. This functions as
*[dimension door]*, using the summoner's caster level. When used,
the eidolon appears adjacent to the summoner (or as close as
possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied).  If the eidolon is
out of range, the ability is wasted. The summoner can use this
ability once per day at 6th level, plus one additional time per
day for every four levels beyond 6th.

**Transposition (Su)**: At 8th level, a summoner can use his
maker's call ability to swap locations with his eidolon. If it is
larger than him, he can appear in any square occupied by the
eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square that was occupied by
the summoner if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.

**Aspect (Su)**: At 10th level, a summoner can divert up to 2
points from his eidolon's evolution pool to add evolutions to
himself. He cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could
not possess, and he must be able to meet the requirements as
well. He cannot select the ability increase evolution through
this ability. Any points spent in this way are taken from the
eidolon's evolution pool (reducing the total number available to
the eidolon). The summoner can change the evolutions he receives
from these points any time he can change the eidolon's
evolutions.

**Greater Shield Ally (Su)**: At 12th level, whenever an ally is
within an eidolon's reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to
its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving
throws. If this ally is the summoner, these bonuses increase to
+4. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled,
helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious.

**Life Bond (Su)**: At 14th level, a summoner's life becomes
linked to his eidolon's. As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit
points, the summoner is protected from harm. Damage in excess of
that which would reduce the summoner to fewer than 0 hit points
is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred
1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced
to a number of negative his points equal to its Constitution
score, all excess damage remains with the summoner. Effects that
cause death but not damage are unaffected by this ability. This
ability does not affect spells like *[baleful polymorph]*,*[flesh
to stone]*, or *[imprisonment]*, or other spells that do not
cause actual damage.

**Merge Forms (Su)**: At 16th level, as a full-round action, a
summoner can touch his eidolon and the two can merge forms. This
transformation includes all of the summoner's gear. While merged
in this way, the summoner is protected from harm and cannot be
the target of spells or effects. All effects and spells currently
targeting the summoner are suspended until the summoner emerges
from the eidolon (although durations continue to expire).

The summoner can cast spells while inside the eidolon by taking
control of the eidolon for the duration of the casting. Any
material components used for these spells are taken from the
summoner's gear, even though they are otherwise inaccessible. The
summoner can direct all of the eidolon's actions while merged,
can perceive through its senses, and can speak through its voice.

The summoner can use this ability for a number of rounds per day
equal to his summoner level. He can end this effect at any time
as a swift action. The summoner emerges in a square adjacent to
the eidolon if able. If the eidolon is returned to its home plane
while the summoner is merged with it, the summoner is immediately
ejected, taking 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round.

**Greater Aspect (Su)**: At 18th level, a summoner can divert
more of his eidolon's evolutions to himself. This ability
functions as the aspect ability, but up to 6 evolution points can
be taken. Unlike the aspect ability, the eidolon loses 1 point
from its evolution pool for every 2 points (or fraction thereof)
diverted to the summoner.

**Twin Eidolon (Su)**: At 20th level, a summoner and his eidolon
share a true connection. As a standard action, the summoner can
assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions,
form, and abilities. His Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
scores change to match the base scores of his eidolon. He can
choose to have any gear that he carries become absorbed by his
new form, as with spells from the polymorph subschool. Items with
continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this
way. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits
(except bonus feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the
abilities granted by his eidolon's evolutions. The summoner
retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this
form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner
level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must
be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect
as a free action.


### Eidolons

An eidolon's abilities are determined by the summoner's level and
by the choices made using its evolution pool. Table 2-9: Eidolon
Base Statistics determines many of the base statistics of the
eidolon. Each eidolon possesses a base form that modifies these
base statistics.  Eidolons are outsiders for the purpose of
determining which spells affect them.

**Class Level**: This is the character's summoner level.

**HD**: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the
eidolon possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier,
as normal.

**BAB**: This is the eidolon's base attack bonus. An eidolon's
base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Eidolons do not gain
additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base
attack bonus.

**Good/Bad Saves**: These are the eidolon's base saving throw
bonuses.  An eidolon possesses two good saving throws and one bad
saving throw, determined by the creature's base form.

**Skills**: This lists the eidolon's total skill ranks. An
eidolon can assign skill ranks to any skill, but it must possess
the appropriate appendages to use some skills. Eidolons with
Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as
normal (an eidolon receives a number of skill ranks equal to 6 +
its Intelligence modifier per HD). An eidolon cannot have more
ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Eidolon skill ranks are
set once chosen, even if the creature changes when the summoner
gains a new level.

**Feats**: This is the total number of feats possessed by an
eidolon.  Eidolons can select any feat that they qualify for, but
they must possess the appropriate appendages to use some
feats. Eidolon feats are set once chosen, even if the creature
changes when the summoner gains a new level. If, due to changes,
the eidolon no longer qualifies for a feat, the feat has no
effect until the eidolon once again qualifies for the feat.

**Armor Bonus**: The number noted here is the eidolon's base
total armor bonus. This bonus may be split between an armor bonus
and a natural armor bonus, as decided by the summoner. This
number is modified by the eidolon's base form and some options
available through its evolution pool. An eidolon cannot wear
armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the summoner's
connection to the eidolon.

**Str/Dex Bonus**: Add this modifier to the eidolon's Strength
and Dexterity scores, as determined by its base form. Some
options available through the eidolon's evolution pool might
modify these scores.

**Evolution Pool**: The value given in this column is the total
number of points in the eidolon's evolution pool. Points from
this pool can be spent on a wide variety of modifications and
upgrades that add new abilities, attacks, and powers to the
eidolon. Whenever the summoner gains a level, the number in this
pool increases and the summoner can spend these points to change
the abilities of the eidolon. These choices are not set. The
summoner can change them whenever he gains a level (and through
the *[transmogrify]*spell).

**Max. Attacks**: This indicates the maximum number of natural
attacks that the eidolon is allowed to possess at the given
level. If the eidolon is at its maximum, it cannot take
evolutions that grant additional natural attacks. This does not
include attacks made with weapons.

**Special**: This includes a number of abilities gained by all
eidolons as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is
described below.

*[Darkvision] (Ex)*: The eidolon has darkvision out to a range of
60 feet.

*Link (Ex)*: A summoner and his eidolon share a mental link
allows for communication across any distance (as long as they are
on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing
the summoner to give orders to his eidolon at any time. In
addition, magic items interfere with the summoner's connection to
his eidolon. As a result, the summoner and his eidolon share
magic item slots. For example, if the summoner is wearing a ring,
his eidolon can wear no more than one ring.  In case of a
conflict, the items worn by the summoner remain active, and those
used by the eidolon become dormant. The eidolon must possess the
appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.

*Share Spells (Ex)*: The summoner may cast a spell with a target
of “you” on his eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch)
instead of on himself. A summoner may cast spells on his eidolon
even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the
eidolon's type (outsider).  Spells cast in this way must come
from the summoner spell list. This ability does not allow the
eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they
function like spells.

*Evasion (Ex)*: If an eidolon is subjected to an attack that
normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage
if it makes a successful saving throw.

*Ability Score Increase (Ex)*: The eidolon adds +1 to one of its
ability scores.

*Devotion (Ex)*: An eidolon gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves
against enchantment spells and effects.

*[Multiattack]*: An eidolon gains [Multiattack] as a bonus feat
if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does not already have
that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural
attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the eidolon
instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons,
albeit at a -5 penalty. If the eidolon later gains 3 or more
natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead
gains [Multiattack].

*Improved Evasion (Ex)*: When subjected to an attack that allows
a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an eidolon takes no damage
if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the

  : Table: Eidolon Base Statistics


### Eidolon Skills

The following skills are class skills for eidolons: [Bluff]
(Cha), [Craft] (Int), [Knowledge] (planes) (Int), [Perception]
(Wis), [Sense Motive] (Wis), and [Stealth] (Dex). In addition, at
1st level, the summoner can choose 4 additional skills to be
class skills for his eidolon. Note that eidolons with a fly speed
receive [Fly] (Dex) as a free class skill, even if they do not
gain a fly speed until a later level.


#### Base Forms

Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its
starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All
natural attacks are made using the eidolon's full base attack
bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary
attacks). Eidolon attacks add the eidolon's Strength modifier to
the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it
adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. These base forms also
note any free evolutions that base form possesses. The bonuses
from these free evolutions are already factored into the starting
statistics.

Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a
Small eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to
its Dexterity score. It also takes a -4 penalty to its Strength
and a -2 penalty to its Constitution. It also gains a +1 size
bonus to its AC and attack rolls, a -1 penalty to its CMB and CMD
scores, a +2 bonus on its [Fly] skill checks, and a +4 bonus on
its [Stealth] skill checks. Reduce the damage of all of its
attacks by one step (1d6 becomes 1d4, 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this
choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever the
summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool (which causes it
to lose these modifiers for being Small).

#### Quadruped

**Starting Statistics**: **Size** Medium; **Speed** 40 ft.;
**AC** +2 natural armor; **Saves**Fort (good), Ref (good), Will
(bad); **Attack** bite (1d6); **Ability Scores** Str 14, Dex 14,
Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; **Free Evolutions** bite, limbs
(legs) (2).


#### Biped

**Starting Statistics**: **Size** Medium; **Speed** 30 ft.;
**AC** +2 natural armor; **Saves**Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will
(good); **Attack** 2 claws (1d4); **Ability Scores** Str 16, Dex
12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; **Free Evolutions** claws,
limbs (arms), limbs (legs).


#### Serpentine

**Starting Statistics**: **Size** Medium; **Speed** 20 ft., climb
20 ft.; **AC** +2 natural armor; **Saves**Fort (bad), Ref (good),
Will (good); **Attack** bite (1d6), tail slap (1d6); **Ability
Scores** Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; **Free
Evolutions**bite, climb, reach (bite), tail, tail slap.

### Evolutions

Each eidolon receives a number of evolution points that can be
spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other
upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed
whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise
set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific
base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can
be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional
natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using
the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's
Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as
secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus - 5 and
add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if
positive). If the eidolon only has a single natural attack, the
attack is made using its full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2
times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that
attack, regardless of the attack's type.

Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution
points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must
be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise
noted, each evolution can only be selected once.


#### 1-Point Evolutions

The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon's
evolution pool.

*Bite (Ex)*: An eidolon's maw is full of razor-sharp teeth,
giving it a bite attack. This attack is a primary attack. The
bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). If
the eidolon already has a bite attack, this evolution allows it
to deal 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made
with its bite.

*Claws (Ex)*: An eidolon has a pair of vicious claws at the end
of its limbs, giving it two claw attacks. These attacks are
primary attacks.  The claws deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if
Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs evolution to
take this evolution. This evolution can only be applied to the
limbs (legs) evolution once This evolution can be selected more
than once, but the eidolon must possess an equal number of the
limbs evolution.

*[Climb] (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes a skilled climber, gaining a
climb speed equal to its base speed. This evolution can be
selected more than once. Each additional time it is selected,
increase the eidolon's climb speed by 20 feet.

*Gills (Ex)*: An eidolon has gills and can breathe underwater
indefinitely.

*Improved Damage (Ex)*: One of the eidolon's natural attacks is
particularly deadly. Select one natural attack form and increase
the damage die type by one step. This evolution can be selected
more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon
selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack.

*[Improved Natural Armor] (Ex)*: An eidolon's hide grows thick
fur, rigid scales, or bony plates, giving it a +2 bonus to its
natural armor. This evolution can be taken once for every five
levels the summoner possesses.

*Magic Attacks (Su)*: An eidolon is infused with magic, allowing
it to treat all of its natural attacks as if they were magic for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If the summoner is
10th level or higher, all of the eidolon's weapons are treated as
the alignment of the eidolon for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.

*[Mount] (Ex)*: An eidolon is properly skilled and formed to
serve as a combat-trained mount. The eidolon must be at least one
size category larger than its rider. This evolution is only
available to eidolons of the quadruped and serpentine base forms.

*Pincers (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a large pincers at the end of
one pair of its limbs, giving it two pincer attacks. These
attacks are secondary attacks. The pincers deal 1d6 points of
damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge). Eidolons with the grab
evolution linked to pincers gain a +2 bonus on CMB checks made to
grapple. The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take
this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws
from its base form with pincers (this still costs 1 evolution
point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the
eidolon must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.

*Pounce (Ex)*: An eidolon gains quick reflexes, allowing it to
make a full attack after a charge. This evolution is only
available to eidolons of the quadruped base form.

*Pull (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the ability to pull creatures
closer with a successful attack. Select one type of natural
attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the
selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If
successful, the target of the attack is pulled 5 feet closer to
the eidolon. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal
to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pulled in this way do
not provoke attacks of opportunity. The eidolon must have a reach
of 10 feet or more to select this evolution. This evolution can
be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time
an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different
natural attack.

*Push (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the ability to push creatures away
with a successful attack. Select one type of natural
attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the
selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If
successful, the target of the attack is pushed 5 feet directly
away from the eidolon. This ability only works on creatures of a
size equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pushed in
this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This evolution
can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each
time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different
natural attack.

*Reach (Ex)*: One of an eidolon's attacks is capable of striking
at foes at a distance. Pick one attack. The eidolon's reach with
that attack increases by 5 feet.

*[Resistance] (Ex)*: An eidolon's form takes on a resiliency to
one particular energy type, which is usually reflected in its
physical body (ashen hide for fire, icy breath for cold, and so
on). Pick one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic). The eidolon gains resist 5 against that energy type. This
resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the summoner
possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This evolution can
be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time
an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different
energy type.

*Scent (Ex)*: An eidolon's sense of smell becomes quite
acute. The eidolon gains the [scent] special quality, allowing it
to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the
opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind,
it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the
normal range. Scent does not allow the eidolon to precisely
locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect
the direction with a move action. The eidolon can pinpoint the
creature's location if it is within 5 feet. The eidolon can use
scent to track creatures.

*Skilled (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes especially adept at a specific
skill, gaining a +8 racial bonus on that skill. This evolution
can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each
time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different
skill.

*Slam (Ex)*: An eidolon can deliver a devastating slam
attack. This attack is a primary attack. The slam deals 1d8
points of damage (2d6 if Large, 2d8 if Huge). The eidolon must
have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this
evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws from
its base form with this slam attack (this still costs 1 evolution
point). This evolution can be selected more than once, but the
eidolon must possess an equal number of the limbs evolution.

*Sting (Ex)*: An eidolon possesses a long, barbed stinger at the
end of its tail, granting it a sting attack. This attack is a
primary attack.  The sting deals 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if
Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must possess the tail evolution
to take this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than
once, but the eidolon must possess an equal number of the tail
evolution.

*[Swim] (Ex)*: An eidolon gains webbed hands, feet, or powerful
flippers, giving it a swim speed equal to its base speed. This
evolution does not give the eidolon the ability to breathe
underwater. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each
additional time it is selected, increase the eidolon's swim speed
by 20 feet.

*Tail (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a long, powerful tail. This grants
it a +2 racial bonus on [Acrobatics] checks made to balance on a
surface. This evolution can be selected more than once.

*Tail Slap (Ex)*: An eidolon can use its tail to bash nearby
foes, granting it a tail slap attack. This attack is a secondary
attack. The tail slap deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large,
2d6 if Huge). The eidolon must possess the tail evolution to take
this evolution. This evolution can be selected more than once,
but the eidolon must possess an equal number of the tail
evolution.

*Tentacle (Ex)*: An eidolon possesses a long, sinuous tentacle,
granting it a tentacle attack. This attack is a secondary
attack. The tentacle attack deals 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if
Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution can be selected more than
once.

*Wing Buffet (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to use its wings to batter
foes, granting it two wing buffet attacks. These attacks are
secondary attacks. The wing buffets deal 1d4 points of damage
(1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). The eidolon must possess the flight
evolution, with wings, to select this evolution.


#### 2-Point Evolutions

The following evolutions cost 2 points from the eidolon's
evolution pool.

*Ability Increase (Ex)*: An eidolon grows larger muscles, gains
faster reflexes, achieves greater intelligence, or acquires
another increase to one of its abilities. Increase one of the
eidolon's ability scores by +2. This evolution can be selected
more than once. It can only be applied once to an individual
ability score, plus 1 additional time for every 6 levels the
summoner possesses.

*Constrict (Ex)*: An eidolon gains powerful muscles that allow it
to crush those it grapples. Whenever the eidolon successfully
grapples a foe using the grab evolution, it deals additional
damage equal to the amount of damage dealt by the attack used by
the grab evolution. This evolution is only available to eidolons
of the serpentine base form.

*Energy Attacks (Su)*: An eidolon's attacks become charged with
energy.  Pick one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or
fire. All of the eidolon's natural attacks deal 1d6 points of
energy damage of the chosen type on a successful hit. The
summoner must be at least 5th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Flight (Ex or Su)*: An eidolon grows large wings, like those of
a bat, bird, insect, or dragon, gaining the ability to fly. The
eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolon's
maneuverability depends on it size. Medium or smaller eidolons
have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average
maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor
maneuverability. For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon
flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, but its
maneuverability increases to perfect. Flying via magic means
makes this a supernatural ability. The eidolon's fly speed can be
increased by spending additional evolution points, gaining a
20-foot increase to fly speed for each additional point
spent. The summoner must be at least 5th level before selecting
this evolution.

*Gore (Ex)*: An eidolon grows a number of horns on its head,
giving it a gore attack. This attack is a primary attack. The
gore deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge).

*Grab (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes adept at grappling foes, gaining
the grab ability. Pick bite, claw, pincers, slam, tail slap, or
tentacle attacks. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack
of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver
check. If successful, the eidolon grapples the target. This
ability only works on creatures of a size one category smaller
than the eidolon or smaller. Eidolons with this evolution receive
a +4 bonus on CMB checks made to grapple.

*Immunity (Su)*: An eidolon's body becomes extremely resilient to
one energy type, gaining immunity to that type. Pick one energy
type: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The eidolon gains
immunity to that energy type. This evolution can be selected more
than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time it applies to a
different energy type. The summoner must be at least 7th level
before selecting this evolution.

*Limbs (Ex)*: An eidolon grows an additional pair of limbs. These
limbs can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs,
complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon's
base speed by 10 feet.  Alternatively, they can be made into
arms, complete with hands. The eidolon does not gain any
additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it
can take other evolutions that add additional attacks (such as
claws or a slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield
weapons, if the eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be
selected more than once.

*[Poison] (Ex)*: An eidolon secretes toxic venom, gaining a
poison attack. Pick one bite or sting attack.  Whenever the
selected attack hits, the target is poisoned. **Eidolon
poison**-*type* poison (injury); *save*Fort negates; *frequency*
1/round for 4 rounds; *effect* 1d4 Str damage; *cure*1 save. The
save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's
Constitution modifier. For 2 additional evolution points, this
poison deals Constitution damage instead. This poison can be used
no more than once per round. The summoner must be at least 7th
level before selecting this evolution.

*Rake (Ex)*: An eidolon grows dangerous claws on its feet,
allowing it to make 2 rake attacks on foes it is grappling. These
attacks are primary attacks. The eidolon receives these
additional attacks each time it succeeds on a grapple check
against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of damage
(1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution is only available to
eidolons of the quadruped base form. This evolution counts as one
natural attack toward te eidolon's maximum. The summoner must be
at least 4th level before selecting this evolution.

*Rend (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to rip and tear the flesh of those
it attacks with its claws, gaining the rend ability. Whenever the
eidolon makes two successful claw attacks against the same target
in 1 round, its claws latch onto the flesh and deal extra
damage. This damage is equal to the damage dealt by one claw
attack plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modifier. The
eidolon must possess the claws evolution to select this
evolution. The summoner must be at least 6th level before
selecting this evolution.

*[Trample] (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes
underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action,
the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least one size
smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat maneuver,
but the eidolon does not need to make a check, it merely has to
move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of
damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the
eidolon's Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can make
attacks of opportunity at a -4 penalty. If a target forgoes the
attack of opportunity, it can make a Reflex save for half
damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the
eidolon's Strength modifier. A trampling eidolon can only deal
trampling damage to a creature once per round. This evolution is
only available to eidolons of the biped or quadruped base forms.

*Tremorsense (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes attuned to vibrations in
the ground, gaining tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet. This
works like the blindsense evolution, but only if both the eidolon
and the creature to be pinpointed are in contact with the
ground. The summoner must be at least 7th level before selecting
this evolution.

*Trip (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the
ground with its bite, granting it a trip attack. Whenever the
eidolon makes a successful bite attack of the selected type, it
can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If successful, the
target is knocked prone. If the check fails, the eidolon is not
tripped in return. This ability only works on creatures of a size
equal to or smaller than the eidolon. The eidolon must possess
the bite evolution to select this evolution.

*Weapon Training (Ex)*: An eidolon learns to use a weapon,
gaining [Simple Weapon Proficiency] as a bonus feat. If 2
additional evolution points are spent, it gains proficiency with
all martial weapons as well.


#### 3-Point Evolutions

The following evolutions cost 3 points from the eidolon's
evolution pool.

*Blindsense (Ex)*: An eidolon's senses become incredibly acute,
giving it blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. This ability
allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it
cannot see without having to make a [Perception] check, but such
creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon.
Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement and it is still
denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from
creatures it cannot see. The summoner must be at least 9th level
before selecting this evolution.

*Burrow (Ex)*: An eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing
it to move through the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed
equal to 1/2 its base speed. It can use this speed to move
through dirt, clay, sand, and earth. It does not leave a hole
behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface. The summoner
must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

*Damage Reduction (Su)*: An eidolon's body becomes resistant to
harm, granting it damage reduction. Choose one alignment:
chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. The eidolon gains DR 5 that can
be bypassed by weapons that possess the chosen alignment. The
alignment must be opposite to one of the alignments possessed by
the eidolon. At 12th level, this protection can be increased to
DR 10 by spending 2 additional evolution points. The summoner
must be at least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

*Frightful Presence (Ex)*: An eidolon becomes unsettling to its
foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can
activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a
charge or attack.  Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must
make a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this
save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's
Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice
than an opponent, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes
with more HD than the eidolon are immune to this effect.  The
summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Swallow Whole (Ex)*: An eidolon gains the swallow whole ability,
giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins
its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the
grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to
swallow the creature. The creature can be up to one size category
smaller than the eidolon.  Swallowed creatures take damage equal
to the eidolon's bite damage each round plus 1d6 points of
bludgeoning damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled
condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light
slashing or piercing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut
free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The
eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its
natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out,
the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this
damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to
escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has
returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape
or be swallowed again. The eidolon must possess the grab
evolution, tied to a bite attack, to take this evolution. The
summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this
evolution.

*[Web] (Ex)*: An eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it
the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use these webs to
support itself plus up to one creature of the same size.  It can
throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to 8 times per day,
entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The
webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range
increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with an
[Escape Artist] check or a Strength check (at a -4 penalty). The
DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the
eidolon's Con modifier. The webs have a Hardness of 0 and a
number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The
eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can
pinpoint any creature touching its webs. The eidolon must possess
the climb evolution to take this evolution. The summoner must be
at least 7th level before selecting this evolution.


#### 4-Point Evolutions

The following evolutions cost 4 points from the eidolon's
evolution pool.

*Blindsight (Ex)*: An eidolon's senses sharpen even further,
granting it blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can
maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility,
and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to
the target. The eidolon must possess the blindsense evolution to
take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 11th level
before selecting this evolution.

*Breath Weapon (Su)*: An eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line
of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select either acid,
cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot
cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the
selected type per HD it possesses. Those caught in the breath
weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal
to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Constitution
modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The
eidolon can use this ability 1 additional time per day by
spending an additional 1 evolution point (maximum 3/day). The
summoner must be at least 9th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Fast Healing (Su)*: An eidolon's body gains the ability to heal
wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals
1 point of damage each round, just like natural healing. Fast
healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation,
thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow
lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing
functions as long as the eidolon is alive.  This fast healing
does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as
its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 per round for
every 2 additional evolution points spent (maximum 5). The
summoner must be at least 11th level before selecting this
evolution.

*Large (Ex)*: An eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The
eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution,
and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -2 penalty to its
Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -1 size
penalty to its AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus to its CMB and
CMD, a -2 penalty on [Fly] skill checks, and a -4 penalty on
[Stealth] skill checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form,
it also gains 10-foot reach. Any reach evolutions the eidolon
possesses are added to this total. The eidolon must be Medium to
take this evolution. The summoner must be at least 8th level
before selecting this evolution.

If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead
becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +16 bonus to Strength, a +8
bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It
takes a -4 penalty to its Dexterity. This size change also give
the creature a -2 size penalty to its AC and attack rolls, a +2
bonus to its CMB and CMD, 10-foot reach, a -4 penalty on [Fly]
skill checks, and a -8 penalty on [Stealth] skill checks. If the
eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet
(10 feet for all other base forms). Any reach evolutions the
eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and
penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from
becoming Large. The summoner must be at least 13th level before
selecting this option.

The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution
points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a
Large or Huge eidolon.

*Spell [Resistance] (Ex)*: An eidolon is protected against magic,
gaining spell resistance. The eidolon's spell resistance is equal
to 11 + the summoner's level. This spell resistance does not
apply to spells cast by the summoner. The summoner must be at
least 9th level before selecting this evolution.

## Witch

Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others
through blood, but the witch gains power from her communion with
the unknown.  Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws
her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power. Communing
with that source, using her familiar as a conduit, the witch
gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange
abilities known as hexes. As a witch grows in power, she might
learn about the source of her magic, but some remain blissfully
unaware. Some are even afraid of that source, fearful of what it
might be or where its true purposes lie.

**Role**: While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of
civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The
blend of witches' spells makes them adept at filling a number of
different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them
a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches
travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding
of the mysterious powers that guide them.

**Alignment**: Any.

**Hit Die**: d6.


### Class Skills

The witch's class skills are [Craft] (Int), [Fly] (Dex), [Heal]
(Wis), [Intimidate] (Cha), [Knowledge] (arcana) (Int),
[Knowledge] (history) (Int), [Knowledge] (nature) (Int),
[Knowledge] (planes) (Int), [Profession] (Wis), [Spellcraft]
(Int), and [Use Magic Device] (Cha).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

The following are the class features of the witch.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Witches are proficient with all
simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or
shield. Armor interferes with a witch's gestures, which can cause
her spells with somatic components to fail.

**Spells**: A witch casts arcane spells drawn from the witch
spell list.  A witch must choose and prepare her spells ahead of
time.

To learn or cast a spell, a witch must have an Intelligence score
equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for
a saving throw against a witch's spell is 10 + the spell level +
the witch's Intelligence modifier.

A witch can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell
level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table
2-10. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a
high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 of the *PF RPG
Core Rulebook*).

A witch may know any number of spells. She must choose and
prepare her spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and
spending 1 hour communing with her familiar. While communing, the
witch decides which spells to prepare.

**Cantrips**: Witches can prepare a number of cantrips, or
0-level spells, each day, as noted on Table 2-10 under “Spells
per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they
are not expended when cast and may be used again. Cantrips
prepared using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats for
example, are expended normally.

**Hex**: Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes,
that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch
gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd
level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted
on Table 2-10. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than
once.

Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a
hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch's level + the witch's
Intelligence modifier.

*Blight (Su)*: The witch can curse an animal, plant creature, or
plot of land, causing it to wither and die. Blighting an area
takes 1 round, during which time the witch and her familiar must
be in contact with the target. If it's used on a plot of land,
the land begins to wither the following day, and over the next
week all plants in the area die.  Nothing will grow in that area
so long as the curse persists. A witch can affect an area with a
radius equal to her class level × 10 feet.  Blighting a creature
is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If used
on a creature of the animal or plant type, the creature gains the
following curse: Blight Hex-*type* curse; *save*Will negates;
*frequency* 1/day; *effect* 1 Con damage. Both types of curse can
be removed with a *[remove curse]* or similar magic, using the
save DC as the DC to remove the curse. A witch can only have one
blight in effect at a time. If another blight hex is made, the
first immediately ends.

*Cackle (Su)*: A witch can cackle madly as a move action. Any
creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of an
agony hex, charm hex, evil eye hex, fortune hex, or misfortune
hex caused by the witch has the duration of that hex extended by
1 round.

*Cauldron (Ex)*: The witch receives [Brew Potion] as a bonus feat
and a +4 insight bonus on [Craft] (alchemy) skill checks.

*Charm (Su)*: A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature
within 30 feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This
improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1
step, as if the witch had successfully used the [Diplomacy]
skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
Witch's Intelligence modifier.  A Will save negates this
effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot
be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this
effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2
steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.

*Coven (Ex)*: The witch counts as a hag for the purpose of
joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one
hag. In addition, whenever the witch with this hex is within 30
feet of another witch with this hex, she can use the aid another
action to grant a +1 bonus to the other witch's caster level for
1 round. This bonus applies to the witch's spells and all of her
hexes.

*Disguise (Su)*: A witch can change her appearance for a number
of hours equal to her class level, as if using *[disguise
self]*. These hours do not need to be consecutive, but they must
be spent in 1-hour increments.

*Evil Eye (Su)*: The witch can cause doubt to creep into the mind
of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a -2
penalty on one of the following (witch's choice): AC, ability
checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex
lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's
Intelligence modifier. A Will save reduces this to just 1
round. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 8th level the penalty
increases to -4.

*Flight (Su)*: The witch grows lighter as she gains power,
eventually gaining the ability to fly. At 1st level, the witch
can use *[feather fall]* at will and gains a +4 racial bonus on
[Swim] checks. At 3rd level, she can cast *[levitate]* once per
day. At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number of
minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to
be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute
increments. This hex only affects the witch.

*Fortune (Su)*: The witch can grant a creature within 30 feet a
bit of good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good
luck once per round, allowing him to reroll any ability check,
attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better
result. He must decide to use this ability before the first roll
is made. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is
extended by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the
fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.

*Healing (Su)*: A witch can soothe the wounds of those she
touches. This acts as a *[cure light wounds]* spell, using the
witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the
healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th
level, this hex acts like *[cure moderate wounds]*.

*Misfortune (Su)*: The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet
to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature
makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill
check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A Will save
negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of
this hex is extended by 1 round.  This hex affects all rolls the
target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is
successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
1 day.

*Slumber (Su):* A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to
fall into a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell *[sleep]*. The
creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the save
fails, the creature falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to
the witch's level. This hex can affect a creature of any HD. The
creature will not wake due to noise or light, but others can
rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends immediately if the
creature takes damage. Whether or not the save is successful, a
creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

*Tongues (Su)*: A witch with this hex can understand any spoken
language for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as
*[comprehend languages].*This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th
level, a witch can use this ability to speak any language, as per
*[tongues]*.

*Ward (Su)*: A witch can use this hex to place a protective ward
over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection
bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward
lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A
witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A
witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the witch uses
this ability again, the previous ward immediately ends. A witch
cannot use this ability on herself. At 8th level and 16th level,
the bonuses provided by this ward increase by +1.

**Witch's Familiar (Ex)**: At 1st level, a witch forms a close
bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps
to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a witch by
granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some
types of magic. This functions like the wizard's arcane bond
class feature, except as noted in the Witch's Familiar section.

A witch must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her
spells.  Familiars store all of the spells that a witch knows,
and a witch cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by her
familiar. A witch's familiar begins play storing all of the
0-level witch spells plus three 1st-level spells of the witch's
choice. The witch also selects a number of additional 1st-level
spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her
familiar. At each new witch level, she adds two new spells of any
spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new witch
level) to her familiar. A witch can also add additional spells to
her familiar through a special ritual (see sidebar).

**Major Hex**: Starting at 10th level, and every two levels
thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following major hexes
whenever she could select a new hex.

*Agony (Su)*: With a quick incantation, a witch can place this
hex on one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer
intense pain. The target is nauseated for a number of rounds
equal to the witch's level. A Fortitude save negates this
effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a
new save each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is
successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for
1 day.

*Hag's Eye (Su)*: A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor
that she can see through. This functions as per the spell
*[arcane eye]*. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches
within 10 feet who also have the coven hex can see through this
sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls
it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day
equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive,
but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.

*Major Healing (Su)*: By calling upon eerie powers, the witch's
touch can mend even the most terrible wounds of those she
touches. This acts as *[cure serious wounds]*, using the witch's
caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the major
healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At
15th level, this hex acts like *[cure critical wounds]*.

*Nightmares (Su)*: Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a
hex on a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be
tormented by terrible nightmares. This functions as the spell
*[nightmare]* each time the affected creature attempts to rest. A
Will save negates this effect. If the save is failed, the target
must make a new save each night or be unable to rest.

*Retribution (Su)*: A witch can place a retribution hex on a
creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across
the target's flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature
in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage in
melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage
bypasses any resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the
creature possesses. This effect lasts for a number of rounds
equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates
this effect.

*Vision (Su)*: A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of
the future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1
minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in
contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject
receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year
from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is
only one possible version of the future, making such visions
unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment
of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted
by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and
destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of
joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to
another vision until the current vision has either come to pass
or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on
herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the
vision.

*Waxen Image (Su)*: The witch can spend a full-round action to
create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can
see within 30 feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must
make a Will save. If the subject fails, the witch gains a small
measure of control over the creature. Whenever she exercises this
control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the
effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not
impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the
waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier
before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the
subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the
creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any
weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the
ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one
of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to
be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the
creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it
is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion)
effect.

*Weather Control (Su)*: A witch with this hex can use *[control
weather]* once per day, but creating the weather takes 1 full
hour of chanting, dancing, and communing with her familiar.

**Grand Hex**: Starting at 18th level, and every two levels
thereafter, a witch can choose one of the following grand hexes
whenever she could select a new hex.

*Death Curse (Su)*: This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart,
causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of
30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the
effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the
first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the
creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies
unless it succeeds at a Fort save.  Creatures that fail the first
save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6
points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the
witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect,
but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves
are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again
for 1 day.

*Eternal Slumber (Su)*: The witch can touch a creature, causing
it to drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a
Will save to negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature
falls asleep and cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed
with a *[wish]* or similar magic, although slaying the witch ends
the effect. The witch can use this ability to poison food or
drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an
eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any
one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not
consumed.  Whether or not the save is successful, a creature
cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

*Forced Reincarnation (Su)*: The witch causes a creature within
30 feet to die and be immediately *reincarnated* into a new
body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain
and immediately brought back to life with the spell
*[reincarnate]*. Whether or not the save is successful, a
creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

*Life Giver (Su)*: Once per day the witch can, as a full round
action, touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This
functions as *[resurrection]*, but it does not require a material
component.

*Natural Disaster (Su)*: A witch using this hex calls down the
forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a
*[storm of vengeance]*combined with an *[earthquake]* that occurs
on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the
sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this
effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can
only use this ability once per day.


### Witch's Familiar

Witches can add new spells to their familiars through several
methods. A witch can only add spells to her familiar if those
spells belong to the witch's spell list.

**Spells Gained at a New Level**: A [witch's familiar] learns a
  certain amount of lore and magic as the witch
  adventures. Whenever a witch gains a level, she may add two
  [spells] from the witch spell list to her familiar. The two
  free [spells] must be of spell levels she can cast.

**Familiar Teaching Familiar**: A [witch's familiar] can learn
  [spells] from another [witch's familiar]. To accomplish this,
  the familiars must spend one hour per level of the spell being
  taught in communion with one another. At the end of this time,
  the witch whose familiar is learning a spell must make a
  [Spellcraft]. Most witches require a spell of equal or greater
  level in return for this service. If a familiar belongs to a
  witch that has died, it only retains its knowledge of [spells]
  for 24 hours, during which time it is possible to coerce or
  bribe the familiar into teaching its [spells] to another,
  subject to GM discretion.

**Learn from a Scroll**: A witch can use a scroll to teach her
  familiar a new spell. This process takes 1 hour per level of
  the spell to be learned, during which time the scroll is burned
  and its ashes used to create a special brew or powder that is
  consumed by the familiar. This process destroys the scroll. At
  the end of this time, the witch must make a [Spellcraft] check
  (DC 15 + spell level). If the check fails, the process went
  awry in some way and the spell is not learned, although the
  scroll is still consumed.

#### Adding Spells to a Witch's Familiar

By forging strange bonds with unnameable beings, witches gain the
service of a mystical advisor, a familiar to both serve her and
reveal to her secrets unknown to most mortals. A familiar is an
animal chosen by a witch to aid her in her spellcasting and grant
her special powers.  This uses the same rules as the wizard's
[arcane bond] class feature, except as noted below. A witch uses
her level as her effective wizard level when determining the
abilities of her familiar. A witch can choose any of the
familiars available to a wizard in addition to the new familiars
presented here.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack
for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend
on the witch's level. If a witch possesses such levels, her
familiar always uses the witch rules for familiars, not those
provided by other classes, such as wizards or sorcerers with the
arcane bloodline. A witch's familiar only stores witch
spells. All other spells are stored normally, as noted in their
class features.

If a familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 day later
through a special ritual that costs 500 gp per witch level. The
ritual takes 8 hours to complete. A new familiar begins knowing
all of the 0-level spells plus two spells of every level the
witch is able to cast. These are in addition to any bonus spells
known by the familiar based on the witch's level and her patron
(see patron spells).

*Store Spells*: Starting at 1st level, a witch's familiar stores
all of the spells that the witch knows. This does not allow the
familiar to cast these spells or use spell-trigger or spell
completion magic items.  Starting at 2nd level, and every two
levels thereafter, a witch's familiar adds new bonus spells to
the witch's spell list based on her patron. These spells are
automatically stored by the familiar and can be prepared as
normal once they are gained.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su)*: If a witch is 3rd level or higher,
her familiar can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the
witch and the familiar are in contact at the time the witch casts
a touch spell, she can designate her familiar as the “toucher.”
The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the witch
would. As usual, if the witch casts another spell before the
touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the witch
activates a hex, her familiar can be used to make the touch. She
does not have to be in contact with the familiar to use this
ability.

#### New Familiars

In addition to the familiars presented in the *PF RPG
Core Rulebook*, witches might select any of the following animals
as their familiar. Sorcerers and wizards might also adopt these
new familiars, utilizing the same rules as for any other
familiar.

These familiars make use these statistics: the [house centipede],
[king crab], [greensting scorpion], fox ([dog] with the [young
template]), octopus ([octopus] with the [young template]), and
[scarlet spider].

Familiar    Special Ability
----------- --------------------------------------------------
Centipede   Master gains a +3 bonus on [Stealth] checks
Crab        Master gains a +2 bonus on grapple checks
Fox         Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves
Octopus     Master gains a +3 bonus on [Swim] checks
Scorpion    Master gains a +2 bonus on initiative rolls
Spider      Master gains a +3 bonus on [Climb] checks


### Patron Spells

At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also
select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force,
granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely
understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically
hold influence over one of the following forces. At 2nd level,
and every two levels thereafter, a witch's patron adds new spells
to a witch's list of spells known. These spells are also
automatically added to the list of spells stored by the
familiar. Spells marked with an asterisk (\*) appear in Chapter 5
of this book. The spells gained depend upon the patron
chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up
to the GM and the witch to decide.
