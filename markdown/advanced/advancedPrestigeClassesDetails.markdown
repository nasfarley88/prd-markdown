## Battle Herald

In every army there are leaders who surpass the average
cold-hearted mercenary, battle-scarred veteran, or wizened drill
instructor, not so much in their skill at arms but in their
ability to inspire and lead others. Battle heralds are just such
captains—skilled warriors to be sure, but ones who have honed the
art of leadership to a keen edge and keep it as ready as their
sword as a means to victory. Battle heralds tap into reservoirs
of courage, skill, bravery, and perseverance that those who serve
with them never knew they had, and their allies often find
themselves ascending the mount of triumph following the battle
herald's glorious (if often tattered) banner.

### Class Features

The following are class features of the battle herald prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A battle herald gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Inspiring Command (Ex)**: A battle herald uses her keen
tactical acumen and decisive judgment to lead others to victory,
as well as her mastery of command to assist herself and her
allies in battle.

All battle heralds may use inspiring command to inspire courage
(as the bardic performance ability); bard and battle herald
levels stack to determine the bonuses provided by inspire
courage.

At 1st level, and every two levels thereafter, the battle herald
chooses one command to learn. Unless otherwise noted, these
abilities provide a competence bonus equal to the battle herald's
inspiring command bonus to her and to all allies within 60 feet
able to see or hear her. Commands marked with an asterisk have
the same range as above but only affect a certain number of
allies (which can include the battle herald).

Issuing an inspiring command is a move action. At 5th level, this
becomes a swift action, and at 10th level, it becomes an
immediate action. Maintaining an inspiring command is a free
action that cannot be disrupted, but its effects end immediately
if the battle herald is killed or otherwise prevented from taking
actions (such as being dazed, helpless, or stunned). The battle
herald cannot have more than one command in effect at a time. She
may use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 +
her Charisma modifier, plus 2 additional rounds per level after
1st. She may use rounds of bardic performance to issue inspiring
commands, but not vice versa. Inspiring commands are
language-dependent, mind-affecting effects. The battle herald
cannot maintain an inspiring command and a bardic performance at
the same time (this does not preclude abilities such as
persistent command or the [Lingering Performance] feat, which
continue an inspiring command or bardic performance after the
battle herald stops maintaining it).

*Battle Magic\**: One ally gains a bonus on caster level checks
and concentration checks equal to the battle herald's command
bonus.

*Inspire Hardiness*: Allies gain DR/— equal to the battle
herald's inspiring command bonus.

*Inspired Tactics*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls, on combat
maneuver checks, and as a dodge bonus to AC against any attacks
of opportunity provoked by combat maneuvers.

*Keep Your Heads*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus on Will saves and concentration checks.

*None Shall Fall\**: A number of allies equal to the battle
herald's inspiring command bonus heal 1d6 points of
damage. Targeted allies who are poisoned may attempt a new poison
saving throw with a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus; a failed save has no additional effect, but a
successful save counts toward curing the poison. This healing is
not positive energy and can heal undead creatures.

*Pincer Maneuver*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus to attack and damage rolls when flanking and as a
dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by
movement (including standing from prone).

*Rally*: Allies affected by a fear effect may attempt a new
saving throw against each fear effect on them; this new save has
a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus.

*Reveille*: Allies affected by exhaustion, fatigue, or sleep
effects may attempt a new saving throw against each such effect;
this new save has a bonus equal to the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus. Allies who are sleeping normally automatically
awaken when this ability is used.

*Scatter\**: A number of allies equal to the battle herald's
inspiring command bonus gain the benefits of the [Wind Stance]
feat.

*Shake It Off\**: One ally subject to an ongoing condition may
attempt a new saving throw to negate the effects with a bonus
equal to the battle herald's inspiring command bonus. This
ability does not help against instantaneous effects, effects that
require recurring saving throws to avoid additional penalties
(such as diseases and poisons), or effects that do not allow a
saving throw.

*Sound the Charge*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus to attack and damage rolls. Charging allies
increase their speed by 5 feet times the battle herald's
inspiring command bonus.

*Sound the Retreat*: Allies gain the benefit of the [Lightning
Stance] feat. The battle herald must have the scatter ability to
select this ability.

*Stand Firm*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring command
bonus to CMD and on Fortitude saves.

*Teamwork*: Allies add the battle herald's inspiring command
bonus on skill checks or attack rolls made when using the aid
another action, and if successful, the assisted ally increases
the aid another bonus by an amount equal to the battle herald's
inspiring command bonus.

*Tuck and Roll*: Allies apply the battle herald's inspiring
command bonus on Reflex saves and [Acrobatics] checks.

**Improved [Leadership] (Ex)**: A battle herald with the
[Leadership] feat adds her inspiring command bonus to her
leadership score.

**Voice of Authority (Ex)**: A battle herald is skilled at
shouting commands over the din of the battlefield and signaling
allies when speech is impossible. She gains a +2 bonus on
[Diplomacy] and [Intimidate] checks with creatures with which she
shares a language. In addition, her allies gain a bonus equal to
the battle herald's class level on [Perception] or [Sense Motive]
checks to hear her commands or interpret her secret messages
conveyed with [Bluff]. The battle herald's levels stack with
cavalier levels for the purpose of the cavalier's tactician
ability.

**Easy March (Ex)**: At 2nd level, allies within 60 feet of the
battle herald can hustle or force march during overland travel
without ill effects for a number of hours per day equal to 1 hour
times her inspiring command bonus.

**Inspire Greatness (Ex)**: At 4th level, a battle herald may use
her inspiring command ability to inspire greatness (as the
9th-level bardic performance ability). This ability affects one
creature at 4th level, two at 7th, and three at 10th.

**Banner (Ex)**: At 5th level, a battle herald may fly a battle
standard that inspires her allies. This ability is identical to
the cavalier's banner ability, and cavalier levels stack with
battle herald levels to determine the bonuses provided by the
banner.

**Teamwork Feat**: At 6th level, a battle herald receives a
teamwork feat as a bonus feat. She must meet the prerequisites
for this feat. She can use her cavalier tactician ability as a
move action to grant this feat to allies (if she has the cavalier
greater tactician ability, this is a swift action).

**Demanding Challenge (Ex)**: This ability is identical to the
12th-level cavalier demanding challenge ability.

**Persistent Commands (Ex)**: At 8th level, a battle herald may
allow her inspiring commands to persist even if she is
incapacitated and unable to maintain them. If the player chooses,
the effects of the battle herald's inspiring commands persist for
a number of rounds equal to her Charisma bonus (these count
toward her number of rounds per day limit). This ability does not
apply if the battle herald intentionally stops maintaining an
inspiring command—only if she is dazed, held, stunned, killed,
and so on, and is unable to maintain them. If the battle herald
recovers from incapacity while an inspiring command is ongoing,
she may resume maintaining it as a free action.

**Inspire Last Stand (Ex)**: At 9th level, a battle herald may
use inspiring command to grant herself and all allies within 30
feet the benefits of the [Diehard] feat. Conscious affected
creatures also gain the benefits of inspire courage while at
negative hit points.

**Complex Commands (Ex)**: At 10th level, a battle herald can
have more than one command ability in effect at one time. Each
must be begun separately and requires a separate maintenance
cost. This allows the battle herald to have more than one
single-target command (such as battle magic) in effect at the
same time. The effects of multiple instances of the same command
ability do not stack, even if the bonuses provided by that
ability would normally stack (for example, if the battle herald
maintains two pincer maneuver commands, her allies do not get
double the bonus, even though dodge bonuses normally stack).

The battle herald can also maintain one bardic performance in
addition to her inspiring commands, though each must be begun
separately and each requires its own maintenance cost.


## Holy Vindicator

Many faiths have within their membership an order of the church
militant, be they holy knights or dark warriors, who put their
lives and immortal souls on the line for their faith. They are
paragons of battle, eschewing sermons for steel. These men and
women are living conduits of divine power, down to their very
blood, which they happily shed in a moment if it brings greater
glory to their deity or judgment upon heretics, infidels, and all
enemies of the faith.

Holy vindicators are usually clerics or fighter/clerics, though
many paladins (or even paladin/clerics) are drawn to this class
as well. In all cases, the class offers a further opportunity to
fuse and refine their martial and ministerial powers and role.

**Role**: The holy vindicator has substantial spellcasting
ability, though not so much as a focused cleric or paladin. His
combat skills are considerable and his healing powers prodigious,
and those whose religious views align well with the vindicator
will find a ready ally.

**Alignment**: While lawful vindicators are somewhat more common,
vindicators may be of any alignment.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a holy vindicator, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus**: +5.

**Special**: Channel energy class feature.

**Skills**: [Knowledge] (religion) 5 ranks.

**Feats**: [Alignment Channel] or [Elemental Channel].

**Spells**: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

### Class Skills

The vindicator's class skills are [Climb] (Str), [Heal] (Wis),
[Intimidate] (Cha), [Knowledge] (planes) (Int), [Knowledge]
(religion) (Int), [Ride] (Dex), [Sense Motive] (Wis),
[Spellcraft] (Int), and [Swim] (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Holy Vindicator

### Class Features

The following are class features of the holy vindicator prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A vindicator is proficient with
all simple and martial weapons and all armor and shields (except
tower shields).

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, a vindicator gains
new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige
class. He does not, however, gain other benefits of that class
other than spells per day, spells known, and an increased
effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine
spellcasting class before becoming a vindicator, he must decide
to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of
determining spells per day.

**Channel Energy (Su)**: The vindicator's class level stacks with
levels in any other class that grants the channel energy ability.

**Vindicator's Shield (Su)**: A vindicator can channel energy
into his shield as a standard action; when worn, the shield gives
the vindicator a sacred bonus (if positive energy) or profane
bonus (if negative energy) to his Armor Class equal to the number
of dice of the vindicator's channel energy. This bonus lasts for
24 hours or until the vindicator is struck in combat, whichever
comes first. The shield does not provide this bonus to any other
wielder, but the vindicator does not need to be holding the
shield for it to retain this power.

**Stigmata (Su)**: A vindicator willingly gives his blood in
service to his faith, and is marked by scarified wounds
appropriate to his deity.  He may stop or start the flow of blood
by force of will as a standard action; at 6th level it becomes a
move action, and at 10th level it becomes a swift
action. Activating stigmata causes bleed damage equal to half the
vindicator's class level, and this bleed damage is not halted by
curative magic. While the stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator
gains a sacred bonus (if he channels positive energy) or profane
bonus (if he channels negative energy) equal to half his class
level. Each time he activates his stigmata, the vindicator
decides if the bonus applies to attack rolls, weapon damage
rolls, Armor Class, caster level checks, or saving throws; to
change what the bonus applies to, the vindicator must deactivate
and reactivate his stigmata.

While his stigmata are bleeding, the vindicator ignores blood
drain and bleed damage from any other source and can use
*[bleed]* or *[stabilize]* at will as a standard action.

**Faith Healing (Su)**: At 3rd level, any *cure wounds* spells a
vindicator casts on himself are automatically empowered as if by
the [Empower Spell] feat, except they do not use higher spell
level slots or an increased casting time. If the vindicator
targets himself with a cure spell that affects multiple
creatures, this ability only applies to himself. At 8th level,
these healing spells are maximized rather than empowered.

**Divine Wrath (Sp)**: At 4th level, when a vindicator confirms a
critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 1st-level spell or
available 1st-level spell slot to invoke *[doom]* upon the target
as an immediate action (using the vindicator's caster level). The
save DC is increased by +2 if his weapon has a ×3 damage
multiplier, or by +4 if it is ×4. The vindicator can also use
this ability in response to being critically hit, even if the
attack incapacitates or kills the vindicator.

**Bloodfire (Su)**: At 5th level, while a vindicator's stigmata
are bleeding, his blood runs down his weapons like sacred or
profane liquid energy; when he uses [Channel Smite], the damage
increases by 1d6, and if the target fails its save, it is
sickened and takes 1d6 points of bleed damage each round on its
turn.  The target can attempt a new save every round to end the
sickened and bleed effects.

**[Channel Smite]**: At 5th level, a vindicator gains [Channel
Smite] as a bonus feat.

**Versatile Channel (Su)**: At 6th level, a vindicator's channel
energy can instead affect a 30-foot cone or a 120-foot line.

**Divine Judgment (Sp)**: At 7th level, when a vindicator's melee
attack reduces a creature to -1 or fewer hit points, he may
sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell or available 2nd-level spell
slot to invoke *[death knell]* upon the target as an immediate
action (using the vindicator's caster level). As vindicators mete
out divine judgment, this is not an evil act. The save DC
increases by +2 if his weapon has a ×3 critical multiplier, or by
+4 if it is ×4.

**Bloodrain (Su)**: At 9th level, while his stigmata are
bleeding, the vindicator's harmful channeled energy is
accompanied by a burst of sacred or profane liquid energy,
increasing the damage by 1d6. Creatures failing their saves
against the channeled energy become sickened and take 1d6 points
of bleed damage each round. Affected creatures can attempt a new
save every round to end the sickened and bleed effects.

**Divine Retribution (Sp)**: At 10th level, when a vindicator
confirms a critical hit, he may sacrifice a prepared 3rd-level
spell or available 3rd-level spell slot to invoke *[bestow
curse]* upon the target as an immediate action (using the
vindicator's caster level). The save DC increases by +2 if his
weapon has a ×3 critical multiplier, or by +4 if it is ×4. The
vindicator can also use this ability in response to being
critically hit, even if the attack incapacitates or kills the
vindicator.


## Horizon Walker

Those whose wanderlust drives them to push the boundary of safe
environments sometimes seek the calling of the horizon
walker. Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to
find the safe ways through inhospitable terrain. They are
comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers,
and they can both venture forth onto untrod paths themselves and
guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.

Though rangers are most likely to be attracted to the
ever-wandering life common to horizon walkers, barbarians,
fighters, and rogues have also been known to find it
appealing. Horizon walkers are most common in areas on the edge
of civilization, where they can easily spend time away from the
known and boring streets of settled lands.

**Role**: Horizon walkers have the accuracy and resilience to
face frontline combat. They also have the skills and abilities to
make excellent scouts, often taking the role of the first member
of a group into danger and the last one out. Of course, walkers
shine when adventuring in areas that match their many favored
terrains, but many of the tricks they pick up in specific regions
have application in a wide range of situations, allowing a
horizon walker to be more mobile and resourceful than typical
combatants.

**Alignment**: Anyone can crave new vistas and constant travel,
and thus a horizon walker can be of any alignment.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a horizon walker, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Skills**: [Knowledge] (geography) 6 ranks.

**Feats**: [Endurance].

### Class Skills

The horizon walker's class skills are [Climb] (Str), [Diplomacy]
(Cha), [Handle Animal] (Cha), [Knowledge] (geography) (Int),
[Knowledge] (nature) (Int), [Knowledge] (the planes) (Int),
[Linguistics] (Int), [Perception] (Wis), [Stealth] (Dex),
[Survival] (Wis), and [Swim] (Str).

**Skill Ranks at Each Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Horizon Walker

### Class Features

The following are class features of the horizon walker prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A horizon walker gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Favored Terrain**: At 1st level, a horizon walker may select a
favored terrain from the ranger Favored Terrains table
(*PF RPG Core Rulebook* 65). This works exactly like the
ranger favored terrain ability. The horizon walker gains an
additional favored terrain at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th
level, and he can increase the bonus from an existing favored
terrain as described in the ranger ability. If the horizon walker
has abilities from other classes that only work in a favored
terrain (such as a ranger's camouflage and hide in plain sight
abilities), those abilities work in favored terrains selected as
a horizon walker.

**Terrain Mastery**: At 2nd level, a horizon walker selects a
favored terrain to master. When within this terrain the horizon
walker may, as a move action, grant a +2 bonus on [Climb],
[Stealth], [Perception] and [Survival] checks made by all allies
within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The character masters
one additional terrain at 4th, 6th, and 8th levels.

Mastery of each terrain has additional benefits, outlined below;
these benefits apply to the horizon walker at all times whether
or not he is in the relevant terrain.

*Astral Plane*: The horizon walker's fly speed increases by +30
feet on planes with no gravity or subjective gravity.

*Cold*: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 10.

*Desert*: The horizon walker gains immunity to exhaustion;
anything that would cause him to become exhausted makes him
fatigued instead.

*Ethereal Plane*: The horizon walker ignores the 20% concealment
miss chance from fog and mist, and treats total concealment from
these sources as concealment.

*Forest*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Stealth] checks.

*Jungle*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Escape Artist] checks and increases his CMD against grapple
maneuvers by +4.

*Mountain*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Climb] checks and does not lose his Dexterity modifier to AC
while climbing.

*Plains*: The horizon walker's movement is not reduced by wearing
medium armor or carrying a medium load.

*Plane of Air*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Fly] checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage
rolls against flying creatures. He gains the ability to breathe
air if he cannot already do so.

*Plane of Earth*: The horizon walker gains DR 1/adamantine.

*Plane of Fire*: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10.

*Plane of Water*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus
on [Swim] checks and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and
damage rolls against swimming creatures. He gains the ability to
breathe water if he cannot already do so.

*Plane, aligned*: If the horizon walker selects a plane with an
alignment trait, he can choose to detect as that alignment
(fooling all forms of magic divination) as an immediate action;
this benefit lasts until he dismisses it (a free action).

*Swamp*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Perception] checks.

*Underground*: The horizon walker gains [Blind-Fight] as a bonus
feat.

*Urban*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on
[Diplomacy] checks.

*Water*: The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on [Swim]
checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls
against swimming creatures.

**Terrain Dominance**: At 3rd level, a horizon walker learns
total dominance over one terrain he has already selected for
terrain mastery.  When dealing with creatures native to that
terrain, the horizon walker treats his favored terrain bonus for
that terrain as a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class
feature) against those creatures.This bonus overlaps (does not
stack with) bonuses gained when fighting a favored enemy.

Each terrain dominance grants additional abilities, detailed
below. When the horizon walker gains a new terrain dominance he
may, if he prefers, instead pick an additional terrain mastery.

*Astral Plane*: The horizon walker gains a +1 competence bonus on
attack and damage rolls against outsiders. He gains *[dimension
door]* as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to
3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the
character's level).

*Cold*: The horizon walker gains cold resistance 20 (this
replaces the character's cold resistance from mastery of the cold
terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls
against creatures of the cold subtype.

*Desert*: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10 and
immunity to fatigue.

*Ethereal Plane*: The walker gains *[ethereal jaunt]* as a
spell-like ability once per day (caster level equal to the
character's level). He must be at least 7th level before
selecting this power.

*Forest*: The horizon walker gains *[hallucinatory terrain]* as a
spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the
character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the
character's level). The horizon walker can only use this ability
to create illusory forests.

*Jungle*: The horizon walker gains *[charm monster]* as a
spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the
character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the
character's level). This charm only affects animals, magical
beasts, and creatures primarily found in the jungle.

*Mountain*: The horizon walker gains DR 2/adamantine.

*Plains*: The walker's base speed increases by +10 feet.

*Plane of Air*: The horizon walker gains *[fly]* as a spell-like
ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's
Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).

*Plane of Earth*: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a
range of 30 feet. He must be at least 5th level before selecting
this plane for this ability.

*Plane of Fire*: The horizon walker gains fire resistance 20
(this replaces the character's file resistance from mastery of
the Plane of Fire terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all
attack and damage rolls again creatures of the fire subtype.

*Plane of Water*: The horizon walker's movements and actions are
not hampered when underwater. This allows him to speak, make
attacks, and cast spells normally underwater (as if using
*[freedom of movement]*).

*Plane, aligned*: For the purpose of bypassing damage reduction,
the horizon walker's manufactured and natural weapons count as
the opposite alignment of his chosen plane of dominance. If his
chosen plane has more than one alignment type, he must choose one
of those types for this ability. For example, if he selects
“Hell” (an evil, lawful plane) for his terrain dominance ability,
he may choose “evil” or “lawful,” which means his attacks bypass
good or chaotic damage reduction, respectively.  Alternatively,
if native creatures of his chosen plane are vulnerable to a
particular special material (such as cold iron or silver), he may
choose to have his weapons bypass damage reduction as if they
were that special material. If he selects this plane more than
once for his terrain dominance ability, his attacks count as an
additional alignment or special material (such as “good and
silver” or “chaotic and good”).

*Swamp*: The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a 30-foot
range. He must be 5th level before selecting this power.

*Underground*: The horizon walker gains darkvision with a range
of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision 60 feet, its range
extends by 60 feet.

*Urban*: The horizon walker gains *[charm person]* as a
spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the
character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the
character's level).

*Water*: The horizon walker gains a swim speed of 20 feet. If he
already has a natural swim speed, his swim speed increases by +20
feet.

**Master of All Lands (Su)**: At 10th level, the horizon walker
becomes familiar with and comfortable in all possible
terrains. His terrain bonus in all favored terrains increases by
+2, and he treats all other terrains as if they were favored
terrains (+2 bonus). If a naturally occurring condition of
temperature or weather requires a check or saving throw, he
automatically succeeds. All allies within 60 feet of him gain a
+2 bonus on these checks and saves; if the horizon walker is in a
mastered terrain, this bonus increases to +4.


## Master Chymist

When alchemists blithely use mutagens to turn themselves into
hulking creatures of muscle and reflex, civilized folk often turn
their heads and mutter that such transformations must have a
price. For a few alchemists, that price is transformation into a
master chymist, a creature able to take a monstrous brute form as
an act of will.

Master chymists become two personalities sharing a single
body. Both the hulking “mutagenic form” of alchemical prowess and
the original alchemist who created it think of themselves as the
true form, and they must learn to work together to achieve their
joint goals. More often than not, master chymists eventually
become their mutagenic form, and the original alchemist's body
and mind may only be brought forth when required by social custom
or a need for obscurity and stealth arises.  Unfortunately, the
mutagenic form of a master chymist is often a more violent,
unforgiving personality (which can lead to conflict between the
two versions of the same character).

**Role**: Master chymists are rarely accepted by society once
their nature is revealed, and thus they have a strong motivation
to keep on the move. Adventuring is one of the few activities
that their monstrous form can be useful for, leading many to
constantly explore dangerous areas on the edge of civilization. A
master chymist's resilience and ability to combine bomb-throwing
mayhem with up-close melee carnage is a great benefit to many
adventuring parties, buying the master chymist allies who are at
least willing to overlook her more distasteful features.

**Alignment**: A master chymist actually has two alignments (see
the mutagenic form ability). The only restriction on these
alignments is that they cannot be exactly the same.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a master chymist, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Spells**: Ability to create 3rd-level extracts.

**Special**: Mutagen class feature, feral mutagen or infuse
mutagen discovery.

### Class Skills

The master chymist's class skills are [Acrobatics] (Dex), [Climb]
(Str), [Escape Artist] (Dex), [Intimidate] (Cha), [Knowledge]
(dungeoneering) (Int), [Sense Motive] (Wis), [Stealth] (Dex), and
[Swim] (Str).

  : Table: Master Chymist

### Class Features

The following are class features of the master chymist prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A master chymist gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Extracts per Day**: At the indicated levels, a master chymist
gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in
alchemist. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character
of that class would have gained, except for extracts per day and
an increased effective caster level for extracts.

**Bomb-Thrower (Ex)**: The destructive power of bombs appeals to
the violent urges of a master chymist. Add the character's
alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the
damage done by her bombs.

**Mutagenic Form (Ex)**: A master chymist's mutagenic form is an
alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form,
an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic
potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The
mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's
normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a
different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous
and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her
normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated
people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name,
and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and
strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence
often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or
her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be
different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change
in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her
mutagenic form.

*Example*: Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master
chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature
called Butcher.  Butcher is neutral, and more interested in
seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest
good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by
Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded
friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike
Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to
survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the
character detects as good and is affected as a good character by
spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same
character is neutral, is not revealed by a *[detect good]* spell,
and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.

**Mutate (Su)**: At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure
to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic
form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form,
she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds
together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to
determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this
form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this
form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in
her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's
modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer
duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic
form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as
with an *[antimagic field]*), or she expends another use of her
mutate ability.

A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her
will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal
form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may
be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a
Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25
Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard
action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of
the mutate ability).

At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form
three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th
level and five times per day at 10th level.

**Advanced Mutagen (Su)**: At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of
the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows
in power.  The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a
power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be
accessed in her mutagenic form.  She gains additional advanced
mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level.  The chymist cannot
select the same advanced mutagen more than once.

*Burly (Ex)*: In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy
physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks,
Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a
bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master
chymist's class level.

*[Disguise] (Ex)*: When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can
temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still
retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard
action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the
appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional
minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1
increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal
form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to
her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the
chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax
her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once
this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10
minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form
such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do
not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time
spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic
form.

*Draconic Mutagen (Su)*: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic
form, she gains dragon-like features—scaly skin, reptilian eyes,
and so on, resembling a half-dragon. The chymist chooses one
dragon type (see the [draconic bloodline]) when selecting this
advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed
and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type.
The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The
chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex
half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's
Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per
transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have
an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist
levels) of at least 16, must know the *[form of the dragon I]*
extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced
mutagen to select this ability.

*Dual Mind (Ex)*: The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on
Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is
affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving
throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if
she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her
original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or
back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate
ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The
character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level
plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this
ability.

*Evasion (Ex)*: This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of
the same name, except that it only applies in the chymist's
mutagenic form.

*Extended Mutagen (Ex)*: The duration of the master chymist's
mutation is doubled.

*Feral Mutagen (Ex)*: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist
discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the
purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens.

*[Furious] Mutagen (Ex)*: The damage dice for the feral mutagen's
bite and claw attacks increase by one die step. The character
must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus
chymist level) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen
discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.

*Grand Mutagen (Ex)*: This mutagen is identical to the alchemist
discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the
purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced
mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level
(alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16 and
must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to
select this ability.

*Greater Mutagen (Ex)*: This mutagen is identical to the
alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery
for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced
mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level
(alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 12 and must have
the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this
ability.

*Growth Mutagen (Su)*: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic
form, she increases one size category, as if under the effects of
an *[enlarge person]* spell. The character must have an effective
alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least
16 and must know the *[enlarge person]*, *[giant form I]*, or
*[polymorph]* extract to select this ability.

*Night [Vision] (Ex)*: The chymist gains darkvision 60 feet and
low-light vision in her mutagenic form.

*Nimble (Ex)*: The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives
her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill
checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to her Armor
Class. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class
level.

*Restoring Change (Su)*: When the chymist assumes her mutagenic
form or returns to her normal form from her mutagenic form, she
heals a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her character level.

*Scent (Ex)*: The master chymist gains the scent ability in her
mutagenic form.

**Brutality (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a master chymist's taste for
violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons
easily mastered by her bestial mind. At 3rd level, a chymist in
her mutagenic form deals +2 damage when attacking with simple
weapons and natural attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th
level and to +6 at 9th level.


## Master Spy

Unparalleled practitioners of deception, master spies rely on
deceit and trickery over brawn and spells. A master spy is an
expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection,
and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation. Master spies may
serve countries or private interests, or sell their services to
the highest bidder without a thought to long-term loyalty.

Bards and rogues, with their wide range of skills, are
particularly well suited for the demands of spying. Rogues can
easily pass themselves off as members of most nonmagical
professions (though playing an armored warrior impedes their
natural abilities), while bluffing bards can impersonate a wide
range of other spellcasters well enough to fool a casual
observer. Versatility and adaptability are the watchwords for
espionage, and successful master spies let others complete their
deception for them, subtly drawing targets into their
machinations.

**Role**: Master spies rarely work with others unless they are
under cover. The special skills that serve them so well in the
field ironically make them exceptional leaders, but a master
spy's natural inclination toward secrecy pushes her away from the
limelight. Note that a master spy among adventurers may not
intend to betray them; armed heroes provide excellent cover for a
master spy's true mission, whether or not they know the spy's
intent.

**Alignment**: The practice of espionage demands discipline and a
certain amount of moral and ethical flexibility; more master
spies are neutral than lawful or chaotic.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a master spy, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

**Feats**: [Deceitful], [Iron Will].

**Skills**: [Bluff] 7 ranks, [Disguise] 7 ranks, [Perception] 5
ranks, [Sense Motive] 5 ranks.

### Class Skills

The master spy's class skills are [Bluff] (Cha), [Diplomacy]
(Cha), [Disable Device] (Dex), [Disguise] (Cha), [Escape Artist]
(Dex), [Knowledge] (all) (Int), [Linguistics] (Int), [Perception]
(Wis), [Sense Motive] (Wis), [Sleight of Hand] (Dex), [Stealth]
(Dex), and [Use Magic Device] (Cha).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 6 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Master Spy

### Class Features

The following are class features of the master spy prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A master spy gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Art of Deception (Ex)**: A master spy adds her class level to
all [Bluff], [Disguise], and [Sense Motive] checks.

**Master of [Disguise] (Ex)**: A master spy can create a disguise
in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties
from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or
size are reduced by 1.

**Sneak Attack (Ex)**: This ability is exactly like the rogue
ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by
+1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master
spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on
damage stack.

**Glib Lie (Su)**: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can
deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of
magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check
against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as
if she were under the effect of a *[glibness]* spell); failure
means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to
speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy
the *[glibness]* spell's bonus on [Bluff] checks.

**Mask Alignment (Su)**: A master spy of 2nd level or higher can
alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment
(such as *[detect evil]*). She may choose to detect as any
specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This
ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause
harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard
action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.

**Nonmagical Aura (Sp)**: At 3rd level, a master spy can use
*[magic aura]* twice per day, but only for the purpose of making
an object appear nonmagical.

**Superficial [Knowledge] (Ex)**: A master spy gives the
appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at
3rd level, she can make untrained [Knowledge] and [Profession]
checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were
trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these
checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman
can make untrained [Knowledge] (history) checks about the kingdom
and [Knowledge] (nobility) checks about its noble and royal
families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained
[Knowledge] (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.

**Concealed Thoughts (Su)**: A 4th-level master spy can conceal
her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using
*[detect thoughts]* or similar magic to read her mind, she
decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true
surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect
against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than
surface thoughts.

**Quick Change (Ex)**: Starting at 4th level, a master spy can
assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on
her [Disguise] check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.

**Elude Detection (Sp)**: At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle
divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a
*[nondetection]* spell with a caster level equal to her character
level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard
action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the *[nondetection]*
for 1d4 rounds.

**Slippery Mind (Su)**: At 5th level, a master spy can slip away
from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent
of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from
another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use
slippery mind once per round.

**Shift Alignment (Su)**: Starting at 6th level, a master spy's
control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false
alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items
affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes
helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master
spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a
doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by
*[holy smite]* with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she
were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a
masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where
effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a
shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function
based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting
her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she
changes it again or ends the effect.

**Death Attack (Ex)**: At 8th level, a master spy learns the art
of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This
ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the
master spy has levels in another class that grants the death
attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to
determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet
reached 8th level as a master spy.

**Fool Casting (Su)**: A master spy of 8th level or higher can
trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or
dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against
a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as *[charm
person]*, *[dominate person]*, or a vampire's dominate ability),
she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it
appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not
under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic
link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation
to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a
fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used
when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an
ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.

**Hidden Mind (Sp)**: At 9th level, a master spy gains the
benefit of a constant *[mind blank]* spell at a caster level
equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this
protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot
resume the *[mind blank]* for 1d4 rounds.

**Assumption (Su)**: The ultimate ability of the master spy is to
take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a
full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and
shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination
effects and spells, even ones as powerful as *[discern
location]*, such that they register the spy as being the creature
she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of
deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an
identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action)
or she uses the ability on another creature.


## Nature Warden

Nature wardens are guardians of the wild places of the world,
hunters and explorers par excellence, highly skilled in
negotiating their way among the nonhuman inhabitants of the
wild. Nature wardens befriend and train a beast of the wild as a
companion, and some call wardens “beastmasters” because of these
pets, but nature wardens are much more than tamers of wild
things. They are experts at navigating the harsh brutality of
nature's fury and making do with whatever tools and weapons
present themselves, but they go beyond being hardy survivalists
to become cunning tacticians with keen analytical minds, able to
adapt and prepare for any situation and make the absolute best
use of the advantages that any terrain or environment can afford
them.

Nature wardens are usually druids or ranger/druids, though
occasional ranger/clerics with the Animal domain or even
single-classed high-level rangers or multiclassed rangers explore
this class.

**Role**: The nature warden is a master of wilderness
environments and is at her most powerful in any of the variety of
environments that she has studied. She and her animal companion
form a potent team. They are excellent scouts and versatile
warriors, able to supplement their skills with spells to fulfill
almost any role.

**Alignment:** Nature wardens tend toward nonevil alignments, as
many pursue their profession out of a desire to help and protect
others.  Occasionally evil wardens can be found turning the
bitter realities of the wild upon their enemies or guarding
natural sites tainted by dark fey.

**Hit Die**: d8.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a nature warden, a character must fulfill
all the following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus**: +4.

**Special**: Animal companion class feature\*, favored terrain
class feature, wild empathy class feature.

**Skills**: [Handle Animal] 5 ranks, [Knowledge] (geography) 5
ranks, [Knowledge] (nature) 5 ranks, [Survival] 5 ranks.

**Spells**: Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells.

\* An oracle of nature's bonded mount ability counts as an animal
companion class ability for the purpose of this prestige class.

### Class Skills

The nature warden's class skills are [Climb] (Str), [Handle
Animal] (Cha), [Heal] (Wis), [Knowledge] (geography) (Int),
[Knowledge] (nature) (Int), [Perception] (Wis), [Ride] (Dex),
[Sense Motive] (Wis), [Survival] (Wis), and [Swim] (Str).

**Skill Ranks at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

The following are class features of the nature warden prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A nature warden gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, a nature warden
gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a
divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the
prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a
character of that class would have gained, except for additional
spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous caster),
and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If she had more
than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a nature
warden, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for
the purpose of determining spells per day.

**Companion Bond (Ex)**: At 1st level, a nature warden's class
levels stack with levels in all classes that grant an animal
companion for the purpose of determining her animal companion's
abilities. The nature warden and her animal companion have an
empathic link like that between a wizard and his familiar. At 5th
level, the nature warden's animal companion gains the same
benefits the warden does when in the warden's favored terrain.

**Natural Empathy (Ex)**: For the purpose of the wild empathy
ability, a nature warden's class level stacks with levels in all
classes with the wild empathy ability. When in her favored
terrain, a nature warden adds her favored terrain bonus to wild
empathy checks. She may also choose to use wild empathy to
demoralize an animal or magical beast rather than improving its
attitude, as if using [Intimidate] rather than [Diplomacy].

At 4th level, a nature warden no longer suffers a penalty when
using wild empathy to influence or demoralize magical beasts. At
7th level, she may use wild empathy to affect vermin (whether
mindless or with Intelligence 1 or 2). At 10th level, she may use
it to affect plant creatures (whether mindless or with
Intelligence 1 or 2).

**Mystic Harmony (Su)**: At 2nd level, a nature warden in her
favored terrain gains an insight bonus to AC equal to half her
favored terrain bonus. She loses this bonus when she is
immobilized or helpless.

**Wild Stride (Ex)**: At 2nd level, a nature warden and her
animal companion gain the ability to move through natural hazards
of her favored terrain (such as bogs, loose sand, snow, ice,
rockslides, and so on) at her normal speed without taking damage
or suffering any other impairment (in effect, this is the
woodland stride ability applied to non-plant environmental
hazards). Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to
impede motion still affect her.

**Animal Speech (Sp)**: At 3rd level, a nature warden can *[speak
with animals]*at will when in her favored terrain. Outside her
favored terrain, she can use *[speak with animals]*once per
day. Her caster level is equal to her class level.

**Silverclaw (Su)**: At 4th level, a nature warden's animal
companion and any creature she summons with *summon nature's
ally*gain DR/silver equal to the warden's class level. In
addition, their natural weapons are considered silver for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Favored Terrain (Ex)**: At 5th level and again at 10th level, a
nature warden may choose a favored terrain. This ability is
identical to and stacks with the ranger class ability.

**Survivalist (Ex)**: At 5th level, a nature warden suffers no
penalty for using an improvised weapon or improvised tool. At
10th level, a warden can spend 1 minute examining and adjusting
an improvised weapon or tool; thereafter she treats it as a
masterwork weapon or tool.

**Woodforging (Sp)**: At 6th level, a nature warden can
manufacture wooden items which she may use with surpassing
skill. Once per day, she may use *[wood shape]*as a spell-like
ability with a caster level equal to her nature warden level.  In
her hands, items created with this ability are treated as
masterwork items under the effect of an *[ironwood]*spell; in the
hands of others, they are merely ordinary wooden items of the
appropriate type.  If the warden uses this ability to create
armor or weapons, she may craft them into magic items as if she
had the [Craft Magic Arms and Armor] feat (though they are merely
magical wood in the hands of others, and only ironwood when she
uses them).

**Companion Walk (Su)**: At 7th level, the nature warden's
companion shares the benefits of travel spells (such as *[tree
stride]* and *[transport via plants]*) and polymorph and similar
spells (including *[tree shape]*) cast by the warden from the
druid or ranger spell list. The companion counts either as part
of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more
favorable for the warden.

**Plant Speech (Sp)**: At 7th level, a nature warden can cast
*[speak with plants]*at will when in her favored terrain. Outside
her favored terrain, she can use *[speak with plants]*once per
day as a spell-like ability. Her caster level is equal to her
class level.

**Ironpaw (Su)**: At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her
animal companion and any creature she summons with *summon
nature's ally* DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In
addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the
purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not
stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the
time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits
of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to
her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation
with the companion within 100 feet.

**Guarded Lands (Ex)**: At 9th level, a nature warden may
designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it
as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already
in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square
mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the
entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain
bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus
for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored
terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may
also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within
those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the
creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has
against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the
warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's
favored terrain bonus for that terrain.

A nature warden may have a number of guarded lands equal to her
Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When she reaches her maximum number of
guarded lands, she can select a new guarded land by abandoning an
existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.

**Companion Soul (Su)**: At 10th level, a nature warden's bond
with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends
distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability
increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment
spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion
once per day as if using the *[scrying]* spell, except she needs
no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her
companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can
revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as
*[raise dead]*, except it doesn't require a material component
and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the
ordeal.


## Rage Prophet

Throughout the wilderness, there are those warriors whose powers
are infused by the spirits, who see and hear into the world
beyond and draw unthinkable reserves of power from it. They are
the chosen of the gods, and they often hold status nearly equal
to that of a chief or shaman in a typical tribe, or sometimes
even exceeding this. Rage prophets can dispense advice through
their communion with the spirits and ability to divine the
future.

Rage prophets are always barbarian/oracles, though some have
levels in other classes as well. The most popular oracle mystery
among rage prophets is that of battle, for skill in battle is
respected in barbarian society, but oracles of all mysteries find
their way into positions as war-chiefs, counselors, and
leaders. Some rage prophets choose to live apart or to act as
wandering champions, belonging to all tribes and none, following
the lead of their spirit guides rather than the dictates of any
one tribal chief or council. Though sometimes looked at askance
by tribal leaders, these wanderers are popular with many
barbarians, who see them as the perfect exemplars of the
strength, virtue, and power of the free folk, owing nothing to
anyone but the sky above, the earth beneath, and the spirits
within.

**Role**: The rage prophet has considerable spellcasting ability,
but it usually serves as a conduit to enhance his fighting
prowess. His combat skills are considerable and his ability to
keep himself going in any fight and to focus his physical rage
into supernatural power gives him an unexpected boost in power
and versatility to overcome any challenge.

**Alignment**: Rage prophets may be of any nonlawful alignment,
but chaotic alignments are more common, as they are in the
barbarian tribes from which they hail. Wandering rage prophets
are usually chaotic, living apart from any tribe and the tribal
structure of their heritage as they take up the adventuring life.

**Hit Die**: d10.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a rage prophet, a character must fulfill all
the following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus**: +5.

**Special**: Oracle's curse class feature, moment of clarity rage
  power.

**Skills**: [Knowledge] (religion) 5 ranks.

**Spells**: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

### Class Skills

The rage prophet's class skills are [Climb] (Str), [Heal] (Wis),
[Intimidate] (Cha), [Knowledge] (history) (Int), [Knowledge]
(religion) (Int), [Sense Motive] (Wis), [Spellcraft] (Int), and
[Swim] (Str).

**Skill Ranks at Each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Rage Prophet

### Class Features

The following are class features of the rage prophet prestige
class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A rage prophet gains no
proficiency with any weapon or armor.

**Spells per Day**: At the indicated levels, a rage prophet gains
new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine
spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige
class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of
that class would have gained, except for additional spells per
day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous caster), and an
increased effective level of spellcasting.  If he had more than
one divine spellcasting class before becoming a rage prophet, he
must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose
of determining spells per day.

**Savage Seer**: A rage prophet's class level stacks with
barbarian levels for determining the effect of rage powers, and
with oracle levels for determining the effect of oracle
revelations and his oracle's curse.  This does not grant
additional abilities.

**Spirit Guide (Sp)**: Every rage prophet possesses a spirit
guide, an insubstantial phantom that speaks to his mind, watches
over him, and lends him its strength and wisdom. Whenever the
rage prophet rages, he gains the benefit of a single
*[guidance]*spell from his spirit guide; this bonus can be used
at any time during his rage. The spirit guide also allows the
rage prophet to use *[dancing lights]*, *[ghost sound]*, and
*[mage hand]* as spell-like abilities once per day each (caster
level equal to the rage prophet's class level). The DCs are
Charisma-based.

**Rage Prophet Mystery**: At 2nd level and every even level
thereafter, a rage prophet learns an additional spell from his
spirit guide. These spells are in addition to those listed in
Table 2-6: Oracle Spells Known. Like spells from an oracle's
mystery, the rage prophet cannot exchange these spells for
different spells at higher levels. The rage prophet must be able
to cast oracle spells of the listed level to learn one of these
spells from his spirit guide. The rage prophet treats the spell
as an oracle spell of the listed level. The possible spells are
*[arcane eye]* (4th), *[augury]* (2nd), *[divination]* (4th),
*[dream]* (5th), *[find the path]* (6th), *[helping hand]* (3rd),
*[see invisibility]* (2nd), *[shadow walk]* (6th), *[speak with
dead]* (3rd), *[spectral hand]* (2nd), *[spiritual weapon]*
(2nd), *[unseen servant]* (1st), *[vision]* (7th), and
*[whispering wind]* (2nd).

**Raging Healer (Su)**: At 2nd level, a rage prophet is able to
*cast cure* spells on himself while raging, without having to use
*clarity of mind.

**Indomitable Caster (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a rage prophet adds
his Constitution bonus (if any) on concentration checks.

**Ragecaster (Su)**: Starting at 4th level, a rage prophet's
spells grow more potent when he rages. When using moment of
clarity, he adds his barbarian level to his caster level. At 7th
level, he adds his Constitution bonus to the save DC of any
spells cast while raging.

**Spirit Guardian (Sp)**: At 5th level, the competence bonus
provided by the spirit guide's *[guidance]*spell increases to
half the rage prophet's class level when used while battling a
fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. As a swift
action, the rage prophet can spend 1 round of rage (whether he is
raging or not) to give his armor and weapons the *[ghost touch]*
property for 1 round; this effect ends if the item is no longer
in his possession.

**Enduring Rage (Su)**: At 6th level, as a free action, a rage
prophet can extend the duration of his rage by sacrificing a
spell slot; this prolongs the duration of his rage for a number
of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot used.

**Raging Spellstrength (Su)**: At 8th level, a rage prophet is
able to cast spells with a range of “personal” on himself while
raging, without having to use clarity of mind.

**Spirit Warrior (Su)**: At 9th level, the competence bonus
provided by the rage prophet's *[guidance]*increases to his rage
prophet level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead,
or incorporeal creature. His ability to give his armor and
weapons the *[ghost touch]* property becomes an immediate action
instead of a swift action.

**Greater Rage (Ex)**: At 10th level, when a rage prophet enters
a rage, his morale bonus to Strength and Constitution increases
to +6 and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3.


## Stalwart Defender

Drawn from the ranks of guards, knights, mercenaries, and thugs
alike, stalwart defenders are masters of claiming an area and
refusing to relinquish it. This behavior is more than a tactical
decision for stalwart defenders; it's an obsessive, stubborn
expression of the need to be undefeated. When stalwart defenders
set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole
effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes
their way.

Most stalwart defenders come from the ranks of fighters, often
those desiring to be better guards for friends and
allies. Dwarves are particularly suited to the role, though
stalwart defenders of all races exist. More rarely, barbarians
take the path of the stalwart defender as a matter of pride, to
overcome some perceived shortcoming. Such characters often seem
to suffer from dual personalities, flinging themselves recklessly
into combat one moment, then calmly fending off all attackers the
next.

**Role**: Stalwart defenders are masters of melee combat,
striving to prove that the best offense is a good
defense. Stalwart defenders are normally found on the front lines
of battle, holding a position to cover their allies, leaping into
breaches of opposing formations and holding them open for others,
and guarding more vulnerable allies by acting as mobile
fortifications, stable points in the ever-changing chaos of
battle.

**Alignment**: Anyone can be as stubborn as a rock and dedicated
to holding one point no matter the cost, so stalwart defenders
can be of any alignment. The dedication and practice required to
learn the talents of a stalwart defender come more easily to
characters with a strong respect for order and organization,
however, so lawful stalwart defenders are much more common than
chaotic ones.

**Hit Die**: d12.

### Requirements

To qualify to become a stalwart defender, a character must
fulfill all the following criteria.

**Base Attack Bonus**: +7.

**Feats**: [Dodge], [Endurance], [Toughness].

**Special**: Proficiency with light and medium armor.

### Class Skills

The stalwart defender's class skills are [Acrobatics] (Dex),
[Climb] (Str), [Intimidate] (Cha), [Perception] (Wis), and [Sense
Motive] (Wis).

**Skill Ranks per Level**: 2 + Int modifier.

  : Table: Stalwart Defender

### Class Features

The following are class features of the stalwart defender
prestige class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: A stalwart defender is
proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of
armor, and shields (including tower shields).

**AC Bonus (Ex)**: A stalwart defender receives a dodge bonus to
AC that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels,
until it reaches +4 at 10th level.

**Defensive Stance (Ex)**: At 1st level, a stalwart defender can
enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike
determination.  A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for
a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution
modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for
2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution,
such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like
*[bear's endurance]*, do not increase the total number of rounds
that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per
day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free
action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is
renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not
need to be consecutive.

While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2
dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and
Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The
increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit
points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the
defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit
points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot
willingly move from his current position through any means
(including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or
willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive
stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a
wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle
moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a
result of an enemy's successful use of the [Bluff] skill or an
enchantment spell, his stance ends.

The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free
action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of
rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the
stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance
while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance
multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart
defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately
ends, placing him in peril of death.

A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may
not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage
class feature or the *[rage]* spell).

**Defensive Powers (Ex)**: As a stalwart defender gains levels,
he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the
stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another
defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender
attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the
benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance,
and some of these powers require him to take an action
first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual
power more than once.

*Bulwark (Ex)*: The defender adds his armor check penalty as a
bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to [Bluff] him and
[Acrobatics] checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of
opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens.

*Clear Mind (Ex)*: The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will
save.  This power is used as an immediate action after the first
save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the
GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it
is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance.

*Fearless Defense (Ex)*: While in a defensive stance, the
stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened
conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this
power.

*Halting Blow (Ex)*: If a foe's movement in the defender's
threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the
stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the
foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until
its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A
stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to
selecting halting blow.

*Immobile (Ex)*: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart
defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush,
overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple
attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th
level to select this power.

*Increased Damage Reduction (Ex)*: The stalwart defender's damage
reduction from this class increases by 1/—. This increase is
always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive
stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects
stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before
selecting this defensive power.

*Intercept (Ex)*: Once a round as an immediate action, when a
melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent
ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike
him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits
the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in
effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack.

*Internal Fortitude (Ex)*: While in a defensive stance, the
stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated
conditions.

*Mighty Resilience (Ex)*: The stalwart defender automatically
negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or
sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on
a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from
[Blinding Critical] or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart
defender takes only normal damage from the attack.  This power
may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender
must be at least 6th level to select this power.

*Renewed Defense (Ex)*: As a standard action, the stalwart
defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution
modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained
above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at
10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only
while in a defensive stance.

*Roused Defense (Ex)*: The stalwart defender may enter a
defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive
stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued
condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes
per round spent in a defensive stance.

*[Smash]) (Ex)*: While in a defensive stance, the stalwart
defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a
shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam
attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra
attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus
-5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart
defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the
character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack
as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple;
this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the
attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender
against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.

*Unexpected Strike (Ex)*: The stalwart defender can make an
attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square
threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not
that movement would normally provoke an attack of
opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A
stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting
this power.

**Uncanny [Dodge] (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains
the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally
allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flatfooted, even if the
attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC
if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still
lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses
the feint action against him.

If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he
automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

**Damage Reduction (Ex)**: At 5th level, a stalwart defender
gains DR 1/—. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/—, and at 10th
level it increases to 5/—. Damage reduction from different
sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or
higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other
source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's
DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full
plate (DR 3/—) has DR 6/—.

**Improved Uncanny [Dodge] (Ex)**: At 7th level, a stalwart
defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the
ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart
defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least
four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and
thus sneak attack him).

If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see
above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the
levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue
level required to flank the character.

**Mobile Defense (Ex)**: At 9th level, a stalwart defender can
adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While
in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round
without losing the benefit of the stance.

**Last Word (Ex)**: Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a
stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent
within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to
negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For
example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red
dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the
dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack
hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the
results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from
Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based
damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not
multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are
multiplied normally).  Once the defender's attack is resolved, he
suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this
ability.
