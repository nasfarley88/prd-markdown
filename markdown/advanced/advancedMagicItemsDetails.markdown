  : Table: Armor Special Abilities

A shield or suit of armor with a special ability must have at
least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Champion**: This armor property only works for good creatures
with the challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite evil
ability (such as paladins, half-celestials, and creatures with
the celestial creature template). When worn by such a creature
that uses a challenge or smite ability, the wearer gains a +2
sacred bonus to AC against attacks from the chosen opponent.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[protection from evil]* or *[Protection from Good]*; Price +1
bonus.

**Dastard**: This armor property only works for evil creatures
with the challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite good
ability (such as antipaladins, half-fiends, and creatures with
the fiendish creature template). When worn by such a creature
that uses a challenge or smite ability, the wearer gains a +2
profane bonus to AC against attacks from the chosen opponent.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[Protection from Evil]* or *[Protection from Good]*; Price +1
bonus.

**Determination**: A shield or armor with this property provides
the ability to fight on against seemingly impossible odds. Once
per day, when the owner reaches 0 or fewer hit points, the item
automatically provides a *[Breath of Life]* spell.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[Breath of Life]*; Price +30,000 gp.

**Jousting**: This suit of armor helps its wearer remain mounted
and in control of his mount. The wearer gains a +5 competence
bonus on [Ride] skill checks.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
creator must have 5 ranks in the [Ride] skill; Price +3,750 gp.

**Righteous**: Armor with this property is often engraved or
enameled with religious symbols. On command once per day, the
wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell *[Righteous
Might]*, lasting for 10 rounds. Righteous armor is always aligned
toward good (positive energy), for the effects of *[righteous
might]*.  *[Righteous]* armor bestows one permanent negative
level on any evil creature attempting to wear it. The negative
level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it
is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way
(including by *[restoration]* spells) while the armor is worn.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[righteous might]*; Cost +27,000 gp.

**Unrighteous**: This armor is often sculpted with unholy
symbols. On command once per day, the wearer can invoke an
effect, as per the spell *[righteous might]*, lasting for 10
rounds. *[Unrighteous]* armor is always aligned toward evil
(negative energy), for the effects of *[righteous might]*.
Unrighteous armor bestows one permanent negative level on any
good creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains
as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is
removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way
(including by *[restoration]* spells) while the armor is worn.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[righteous might]*; Cost +27,000 gp.

Table: Specific Armors



**Armor Of Insults**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 16,175 gp; **Weight** 20 lbs.

**Description**

Each metal bit of this suit of *+1 studded leather* looks more
like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the
wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent
of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60
feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must
make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming
compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the
creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or
attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving
through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it
can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic
effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken
language.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [confusion]*;
**Cost** 7,675 gp

**Boneless Leather**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** armor; **Price** 12,160 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This suit of *+1 leather* gives its wearer the ability to twist
and contort his body in virtually any direction. He gains a +5
bonus on [Escape Artist] checks, a +5 bonus on [Acrobatics]
checks to reduce damage from falls, a +5 bonus to CMD, and DR
5/piercing or slashing.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [alter self]*,
*creator must have 5 ranks in the [Acrobatics] and [Escape
*Artist] skills; **Cost** 6,160 gp

**Buccaneer's Breastplate**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 23,850 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 breastplate* is made of bluish metal and decorated with
wave motifs. It allows the wearer to continually utilize the
effects of the spell *[water walk]*. If a creature puts on the
armor while underwater, the wearer is borne toward the surface at
a rate of 60 feet per round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [water walk]*;
**Cost** 12,100 gp

**Daystar Half-Plate**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 81,250 gp; **Weight** 50 lbs.

**Description**

The silvery sheen of this *+1 half-plate* causes it to sparkle in
even the faintest light. At will, the wearer can command it to
shine with a *[daylight]* spell for 10 minutes. Once per day, the
wearer can command it to shine as per the *[sunburst]* spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [daylight]*,
*[sunburst]*; *Cost** 41,000 gp

**Folding Plate**

**Aura** moderate conjuration (summoning); **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck (brooch) or armor (unfolded); **Price** 12,650 gp;
**Weight** — (brooch), 50 lbs. (armor)

**Description**

This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak
clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command,
the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels
to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of *+1 full
plate*, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's
breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform
into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor
slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already
armored.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [instant
*summons]*; *Cost** 7,650 gp

**Forsaken Banded Mail**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 25,400 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

Every inch of this suit of *+1 banded mail* bears a defaced holy
symbol or a design equally offensive to one or more gods and
their servants.  The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine
spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a
connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR 19 against any
divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability
(such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider
serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2
higher against creatures with these abilities.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], creator cannot be
a divine spellcaster; **Cost** 12,900 gp

**Giant-Hide Armor**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 39,165 gp (ogre), 46,665 gp (hill
giant), 59,165 gp (troll), 54,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost
giant), 69,165 gp (cloud giant), 76,665 gp (storm giant);
**Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

This drooping, many-folded suit of *+3 hide armor* is made from
the tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the
wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if
using *[giant form I]* (ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant,
fire giant, or frost giant) or *[giant form II]* (cloud giant or
storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and
ends when the wearer commands. Most good folk consider wearing
the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a
+2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or
+4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as
the attacker.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [giant form I]*
*(ogre, troll, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, or frost
*giant) or [giant form II]* (cloud giant or storm giant);
***Cost** 19,660 gp (ogre), 23,415 gp (hill giant), 29,665 gp
*(troll), 27,165 gp (stone, fire, or frost giant), 34,665 gp
*(cloud giant), 38,415 gp (storm giant)

**Mistmail**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** armor; **Price** 2,250 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

**Description**

The fine links of this *+1 chain shirt* form a pattern of roiling
clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into
thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss
chance).  This mist moves with the character. Effects that
disperse the mist or destroy it cause the armor to reform into
its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the
command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't
function (such as underwater). If the character tries to don
another suit of armor while the *mistmail*is in fog form, it
reforms at the character's feet.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [obscuring mist]*;
**Cost** 1,250 gp

**Murderer's Blackcloth**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 12,405 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This silk *+1 [shadow] padded armor* is as dark as night and
stitched with thread the color of dried blood. When worn by a
rogue with the bleed talent, it increases the bleed damage of the
rogue's sneak attacks by +1.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [bleed]*,
*[invisibility]*, [silence]*; **Cost** 6,280 gp

**Soothsayer's Raiment**

**Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 10,300 gp; **Weight** 40 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 chainmail* is attuned to a particular oracular mystery
and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the
oracle class description). While wearing the armor, an oracle has
access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a
normal class feature.  The oracle must have the appropriate
mystery to use the armor; for example, a *soothsayer's raiment
(battlecry)* is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer
already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability
with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that
ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect
if worn by a non-oracle.

For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success
(such as *[augury]* and *[divination]*), the wearer's chance
increases by +5.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [augury]*, creator
*must be an oracle with the desired revelation; **Cost** 5,300 gp

## Specific Shields

  Major    Specific Shield        Market Price
  -------- ---------------------- --------------
  01-50    *[Battlement shield]*  16,180 gp
  51-100   *[Fortress shield]*    19,180 gp

  : Table: Specific Shields

**Battlement Shield**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** shield; **Price** 16,180 gp; **Weight** 45 lbs.

**Description**

Once per day on command, this *+2 tower [shield]* can transform
into a solid, 10-foot by 10-foot by 1-foot wall of masonry with a
battlement on top and an arrow slit in each 5-foot length. The
wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can
touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower
shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand
or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all
the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry
(hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC of 35).  Attacks sufficient
to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a
shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken
condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or
commanded to return to shield form. The wall cannot appear in a
space too small to accommodate it.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [wall of stone]*;
**Cost** 8,180 gp

**Fortress Shield**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th

**Slot** shield; **Price** 19,180 gp; **Weight** 45 lbs.

**Description**

The wearer of this *+1 tower [shield]* may, as a full-round
action, transform the shield into a 1-inch thick cube of iron
that springs into being around him, completely enclosing his
space. The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This
cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the
cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas
attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or
out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third
round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy
one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into
a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken
condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon
command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or the
wearer falls unconscious or dies.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [wall of iron]*;
**Cost** 9,680 gp

# Cursed Items

The following are additional cursed items that may arise from
faulty item crafting—or in some cases, deliberate
construction. Many cannot be discarded unless a successful
*[remove curse]*, *[break enchantment]*, or similar magic is used
on them.

**Buffoon's Sword**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This blade seems and behaves in all ways as a *[sword of
subtlety]* until actually used in combat. Once used in combat, it
imposes a -10 penalty on all [Stealth] checks made by its
wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to tell
a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time he
does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid blurting
out the truth or taking some other involuntary action that spoils
his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid the wielder
of the sword once its curse activates.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[sword of subtlety]*

**Cannibal Ring**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 16th

**Slot** ring; **Weight** —

**Description**

This simple and unadorned copper ring appears slightly tarnished,
but seemingly wards off the effects of hunger or other sorts of
deprivation; all tests reveal it to be a *[ring of
sustenance]*. However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner
instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst,
which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a
cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of
food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst
check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of
nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience
ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent
creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or
higher).

Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all
nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he
continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst
checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat
part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or
dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge
again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and
thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding
the increased hunger and thirst—on any day he eats at least one
meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to
make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any
accumulated damage from failing these checks. Once its curse
activates, the ring cannot be removed until the curse is broken.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[ring of sustenance]*

**Cloak of Immolation**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** shoulders; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This cloak appears to be a finely made normal garment that
radiates protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined
without harm, but when it is put on, it immediately bursts into
flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak, only its
wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage each round and
cannot be removed unless the curse is broken. Sufficient amounts
of water or other smothering materials can douse the flames
temporarily, but the cloak reignites when exposed to air
again. Spells like *[resist energy]*, *[protection from energy]*,
and similar effects can protect the wearer against the cloak's
flames while they last.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** any cloak

**Crown of Blindness**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** headband; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky
moonstone. When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly
goes dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC 14
Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving throw
must be made each round that the crown is worn until the wearer
succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet requires breaking
the curse. The blindness can be cured using *[remove
blindness/deafness]* or any spell normally used to end a curse.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[headband of alluring charisma]*, [headband of
*inspired wisdom]*, [headband of mental prowess]*, [headband of
*mental superiority]*, [headband of vast intelligence]*,*moon
*circlet*

**Gravesoul Armor**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** armor; **Weight** 20 lbs.

**Description**

This armor behaves in all ways as if it were *+1 [undead
controlling] studded leather* until its owner actually attempts
to use its special property. At that point, the wearer and all
living creatures within a 20-foot radius must each make a DC 15
Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some
sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either
roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampire) or choose
which sorts of undead the affected creatures believe themselves
to be, customizing to the personality and abilities of each
creature. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for
the sorts of undead they regard themselves—“zombies” mindlessly
attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite
victims on the neck, and so on—but gain none of the special
abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react
negatively to effects that harm “their” type of undead, so
“vampires” avoid garlic, “wraiths” recoil from sunlight, and so
on. The creatures otherwise continue to believe they are actually
undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they
defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they
have but “their” type of undead normally lacks; for example, a
barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy
and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures
affected by *gravesoul armor*.

This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of
the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it
can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour
period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still *+1 studded
leather*, and some characters may find it useful despite its
(nonexistent) power over undead. Unlike most cursed items, this
one is easily discarded without any magical assistance.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *+1 [undead controlling] studded leather*

**Hat of Hatreds**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** head; **Weight** —

**Description**

This hat performs in all ways like a *[hat of disguise]* until
its owner attempts to use it to disguise himself in the presence
of a hostile creature. Once he does, the hat causes him to assume
the guise of the creature or person the hostile creature most
wants to harm. The hat never causes the wearer to assume the
appearance of someone the viewer wouldn't harm if he had the
opportunity (for example, the greatly feared leader of the local
temple).

Once the hat reveals its true abilities, it no longer responds to
attempts by its wearer to change his appearance. Instead, it
automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to
and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary
illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or
weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like
the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town,
the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and
staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused
visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some
crime.

Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[hat of disguise]*

**Girdle of Opposite Gender**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** belt; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately
make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into a
person of the opposite gender. The character's abilities, mind,
and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex
changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item
actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an
androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent unless
undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic takes effect,
the belt can be removed without effort. A creature can only be
affected by a particular girdle once, though other girdles of
this type can cause another transformation.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** any belt

**Planar Invasion Shield**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th

**Slot** shield; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This impressive shield seems to be and behaves in all ways as an
*[absorbing shield]* until its owner attempts to use its
disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes
one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the
nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6
rounds before retreating from the battle by the safest possible
route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters
fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the
monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the summon monster
spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that
appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act
as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures
with a permanent duration.

Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three
times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters
cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example,
because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the
nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking
magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an
*[absorbing shield]* and allows its wearer to abandon it.

**Creation**

**Magic Items** *[absorbing shield]*

**One-Way Window**

**Aura** faint divination; **CL**5th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb. (20 lbs. in larger form)

**Description**

This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a
6-foot-by-3-foot window if placed on any sufficiently large
vertical surface and returns to its original size if removed. The
window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to
ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would
normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass. On
command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the
other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth,
or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not
reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it,
allowing observers to study them at their leisure.

However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile
creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window
presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an
artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a
sense of false confidence—enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits
have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While
presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals
those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way
window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror
accurately and can read their thoughts as if using *[detect
thoughts]*.  Furthermore, the image shown to those using the
mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can
see them as well. Once the curse activates, the owner comes to
regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic
(after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever
possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence
(anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't
the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to
continue using it).

**Ring of Truth**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Weight** —

**Description**

Deceptively pleasant looking, a *ring of truth* bears images of
childlike angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding
onto links of a heavy chain. The wearer of this cursed ring is
rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or
writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to
communicate, but even then must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving
throw to avoid answering a direct question truthfully. The wearer
cannot remove the ring unless the magic of the curse is negated.

**Riot Pipes**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all ways like
any other kind of magical pipes until its owner plays it in an
urban setting. Once he does, it requires all people within
hearing to make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid falling into a
murderous fury. Those who fail their saves gain the effects of a
*[rage]* spell for the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong
compulsion (Will DC 15 negates) to attack any stranger or
disliked person whom they encounter during this time. If the
owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an urban setting, he
must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each day to avoid playing the
*riot pipes* at some point during each subsequent day. The pipes
remain with the player until the curse is broken.

**Magic Items** *[pipes of haunting]*, [pipes of the sewers]*,
*[pipes of sounding]*

**Rod of Arson**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a *[rod of
flame extinguishing]* until its owner uses it to extinguish or
suppress a fire in a combat or other sort of dangerous
situation. Once he does, he discovers that rather than quenching
the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter his body. This flame
persists inside of him for the next 24 hours, causing minor
discomfort and giving him the sickened condition, but causing no
visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or
within a flammable object or structure, he feels inclined to set
the object ablaze, using whatever means at his disposal. Each
round the wielder resists this urge, he takes 1d6 points of fire
damage as the flame within him surges and roils. After 1 minute
of this, he must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the
temptation; if he saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops
harming him, and he can interact normally with the flammable
target thereafter.

Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will
saving throw to avoid using it to extinguish or suppress any fire
he encounters which he himself did not start. He cannot use the
rod against fires that he personally started. Successful
curse-breaking magic allows the wielder to get rid of the rod and
harmlessly dissipates any fire persisting inside him from the
action of the rod.

# Major Artifacts

Major artifacts are unique items—only one of each such item
exists, and the creation of them is beyond all mortal means.

**Bottle of the Bound**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The *Bottle of the Bound* is an ancient brass bottle with a
narrow neck and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom
so it stands upright when resting on a table. The bottle's
tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and
sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and
wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle
for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from
the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once
commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried
beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its
inhabitants still bound.

A would-be wielder of the *Bottle of the Bound* must know three
secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the
stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and
command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the
Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use
the bottle like a *[summon monster IX]* spell at will, except
only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned
creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new
creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial
summoned creatures' destruction or return.

No known force can open the bottle without the Word of
Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of
Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting
from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones,
until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and
commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is
free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The
Words to use the *Bottle of the Bound* have been lost for
uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least
one or two of them.

**Destruction**

The *Bottle of the Bound* can only be destroyed if every creature
bound within is slain or banished, and the empty container is
then smashed with a *[holy]* weapon.

**Cloud Castle Of The Storm King**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm
King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at
the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt
of powerful monsters, ignorant of—or unable to tap into—its
fantastic power.

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a
foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and
crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud,
the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at
each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels
and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed
with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with
pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight),
and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each
guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards,
and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen
griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In
all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium
creatures.

Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the
cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously
disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm
King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured
and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing
to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one
day return to reclaim his castle.

In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be
at least 17th level, and must have the [Leadership] feat and 17
ranks in [Knowledge] (arcana). If the castle already has a
master, that master must be defeated before another can take her
place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control
chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th
floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying
device for the castle's master, though it can only view places
inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a
person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within
the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the
[Fly] skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the
castle can hover without needing to make a [Fly] check and never
risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled,
the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every
minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but
always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to
travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm
King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the
castle gains the following spell-like abilities:

*• [Call lightning storm]*
1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to
use this ability.

- *[Guards and wards]* 1/day on the central tower.
- *[Storm of vengeance]* 1/day. The master must be in the control
    chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from
    the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range
    underneath (2,200 feet).
- *[Wind wall]* at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle
    at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the
    master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control
    room or any tower as a standard action.

**Destruction**

The *Cloud Castle of the Storm King* can only be destroyed if it
is dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can
dissipate it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the
Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows how to make it travel
between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it on the
Plane of Air to have any chance to do so). Any other attacks may
cause walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but
the central chamber and the floors beneath it will continue to
exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm cloud as long as this
destruction condition is not met.

**Fork of the Forgotten One**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 12 lbs.

**Description**

This *+5 [flaming] [wounding] [unholy] ranseur* was once the
weapon of a powerful archdevil who they say controlled an entire
layer of Hell. When he attempted to defy the Prince of Darkness,
he was overthrown and banished into some cold and remote prison
at the edge of the multiverse. Still bearing some infernal
vestige of the forgotten fiend's power, the fork grants the
bearer a +10 bonus on [Diplomacy] and [Intimidate] checks and the
power to use *[scorching ray]* three times per day.

Any nonevil creature who touches the *Fork of the Forgotten One*
is given a choice: become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those
who choose death are instantly slain (Fortitude DC 30
negates). Those who choose to become lawful evil change alignment
immediately (no saving throw) and are subject to a *[demand]*
spell (Will DC 25) requiring that they find the Forgotten One and
free him from his icy prison—presumably thereafter he will press
them into service for his plans of revenge against those who
imprisoned him.

**Destruction**

The *Fork of the Forgotten One* is destroyed when a paladin of
19th level or higher touches it and chooses death rather than
becoming lawful evil. This sacrifice still kills the paladin,
though she can be raised from the dead.

**The Moaning Diamond**

**Aura** overwhelming transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The *Moaning Diamond* appears to be an uncut diamond the size of
a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning, as
if wailing in pain. Despite the disturbing noise, the *Moaning
Diamond* is not evil.  Three times per day, the bearer can call
upon its power to reshape earth and stone as if by the spell
*[stone shape]*, affecting 5,000 cubic feet of material. Once per
day the *Moaning Diamond* can also summon an elder earth
elemental with maximum hit points that serves the caster until it
is slain; only one such elemental can be summoned at a time.

**Destruction**

The *Moaning Diamond* can be smashed by the combined power of
three elemental princes, one each from the Planes of Air, Fire,
and Water.  Even then, the dust must be cast into a place where
it will never fall upon stone.

**The Shield of the Sun**

**Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+5 large [shield]*, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun,
allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level
paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative
with any existing spells per day the character might have, even
from paladin class levels. The *[Shield] of the Sun* also grants
its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points
of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity,
or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's
owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity
(no saving throw to avoid).

A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when
wielding the *[Shield] of the Sun*. The negative levels persist
as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any
way (including *[restoration]* spells). The negative levels
disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's
possession.

**Destruction**

The *[Shield] of the Sun* may be destroyed if a good-aligned
character casts it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light
fading into the inky depths before it finally disappears. If a
nongood character does the deed, the shield is not destroyed,
merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it.


# Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they
are magic items that can no longer be created, at least by common
mortal means.

**Beacon of True Faith**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

The *beacon of true faith* takes the form of an ornate torch made
of electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that
requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it
simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine
spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature
of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but
usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the
beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's
alignment. All of these are command-word activated.

Chaotic (violet flame): *[Word of chaos]* once per day on
command.

Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the
benefits of *[protection from evil]* and *[heroism]*.

Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of
*[protection from good]* and may use *[harm]* twice per day.

Lawful (golden flame): *[Dictum]* once per day on command.

**Destruction**

The *beacon of true faith* is destroyed if its bearer turns
against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite
alignment.

**Hammer of Thunderbolts**

**Aura** strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; **CL**
  20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This *+3 Large [returning] warhammer* deals 2d6 points of damage
on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a *[belt
of giant strength]* and knows the weapon is a *hammer of
thunderbolts* (not just the *+3 warhammer* it appears to be), it
becomes a *+5 Large giant-bane [returning] [thundering]
warhammer* with the following two properties. One, when the
bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a
powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to
be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is
not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment
increases to 30 feet.

**Destruction**

A *hammer of thunderbolts* is destroyed if heated in a fire
giant's forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned
humanoid, which causes the iron of the *hammer* to become so
brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only
bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse its brittleness;
once shattered, nothing can do so.

**Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a
piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature
picks it up, the *knucklebone's* true power and nature becomes
apparent. When a creature holding the *knucklebone of fickle
fortune* looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a
perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing
red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of
falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the
eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its
effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a
20-sided die to determine the effect (see Table 7-13). For
effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as \#17)
or a specific result is rolled (such as \#14), the character is
aware of this restriction.

+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|2  |Bvu      |The character is subject to a powerful        |
|   |         |compulsion never to roll the *[knucklebone of |
|   |         |fickle fortune]* again. He can shake this     |
|   |         |compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will    |
|   |         |saving throw. He can only attempt this saving |

+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|3  |Eij      |The character is affected by a *[harm]* spell |

+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|4  |Hor      |The character is subject to a powerful        |
|   |         |compulsion to roll the *knucklebone* three    |
|   |         |more times immediately (Will DC 25            |
|   |         |negates). All three of these                  |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|   |         |rolls are made with a -5 penalty on the       |

|   |         |*[blindness/deafness]* (no saving throw).     |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|6  |Chu      |The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage|
|   |         |(DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half  |
|   |         |speed for the next hour (a successful saving  |
|   |         |throw does not negate the reduced speed).     |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|7  |Roh      |For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a|
|   |         |-2 penalty on all skill and ability checks.   |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|8  |Seh      |The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as |
|   |         |with *[hold monster]*, except he cannot       |
|   |         |attempt new saving throws to overcome the     |
|   |         |effect.                                       |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|9  |Kog      |For the next week, the character emits a      |
|   |         |horrible smell. He suffers a -4 penalty on    |
|   |         |[Diplomacy] checks.                           |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|10 |Vis      |Once, during the next 24 hours, the character |
|   |         |can reroll a single die roll he has just made |
|   |         |and take the second result, as if using the   |
|   |         |good fortune ability from the Luck domain.    |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|11 |Fyeh     |The character gains 100 points of fire        |
|   |         |immunity, as if using *[protection from       |
|   |         |energy]*.                                     |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|12 |Xal      |The character gains the benefits of a         |
|   |         |*[heroism]* spell for the next 200 minutes.   |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|13 |Yaq      |For the next 24 hours, when the character hits|
|   |         |a target he is flanking with a melee weapon,  |
|   |         |the attack does +1d6 points of precision      |
|   |         |damage.                                       |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|14 |Gib      |Once in the next 24 hours, the character can  |
|   |         |cast *[faerie fire]* (caster level equal to   |
|   |         |his character level). This ability is lost if |
|   |         |the character rolls this result again with the|
|   |         |*[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* before the  |
|   |         |24 hours is concluded.                        |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|15 |Xku      |The character is immune to fear for the next  |
|   |         |24 hours.                                     |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|16 |Lev      |Once in the next 24 hours, the character can  |
|   |         |cast a *[lightning bolt]* (caster level equal |
|   |         |to his character level). This ability is lost |
|   |         |if the character rolls this result again with |
|   |         |the *[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* before  |
|   |         |the 24 hours is concluded.                    |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|17 |Nhi      |For the next 7 days, when the character is the|
|   |         |target of healing magic, he heals an          |
|   |         |additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost|
|   |         |if the character rolls the *[knucklebone of   |
|   |         |fickle fortune]* again before the 7 days are  |
|   |         |concluded.                                    |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|18 |Zmi      |For the next 24 hours, whenever the character |

|   |         |effect that does half damage or partial effect|
|   |         |on a failed save, the *knucklebone's*         |
|   |         |character takes no damage or suffers no       |
|   |         |effect.                                       |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|19 |Tem      |For the next 24 hours, the character          |
|   |         |automatically confirms all critical hits.     |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+
|20 |Eha-Zah  |The next time the character dies, he comes    |
|   |         |back from the dead the very next morning as if|
|   |         |the subject of a *[resurrection]* spell. This |
|   |         |effect is negated if the character rolls the  |
|   |         |*[knucklebone of fickle fortune]* again before|
|   |         |he dies.                                      |
+---+---------+----------------------------------------------+

**Destruction**

The *knucklebone of fickle fortune* disappears if its Eha-Zah
face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some
sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it
instead reappears at some random spot in the world, but such
knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether
anyone has accomplished this improbable task.

**Perfect Golden Lute**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

The *perfect golden lute* is said to be a flawless instrument;
its tone and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine
it practically performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a
+10 competency bonus on [Perform] (string instruments) checks
with it. A character with ranks in [Perform] (string instrument)
can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or
fascinate (as the bardic performance abilities) as if he were a
1st-level bard, performing a number of rounds per day equal to
his Charisma modifier. If the user of the *perfect golden lute*
is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all bardic performance
abilities using the lute, and can use bardic performance with the
lute for an additional 6 rounds per day.

**Destruction**

The *perfect golden lute* shatters into splinters if a day passes
in which no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its
bearer is killed by a bard spell or bardic performance.

**Spindle of Perfect [Knowledge]**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

The *spindle of perfect knowledge* is large, bright, and flawless
marquise-cut diamond *[ioun stone]* the size of a halfling's
fist. The gemstone would be a treasure in itself if it lacked
magic, but it is also a powerful *[ioun stone]*. The *spindle of
perfect knowledge* functions like a *[headband of mental
superiority]* +4 and grants 5 ranks in two random [Knowledge]
skills. The wearer can communicate and understand languages as if
using *[comprehend languages]*, *[tongues]*, and telepathy with a
range of 100 feet.

**Destruction**

The *spindle of perfect knowledge* is destroyed if worn by a
mindless creature for an entire year.

**Talisman of Reluctant Wishes**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A *talisman of reluctant wishes* appears the same as a *stone of
controlling earth elementals*, a rugged rock that seems to pulse
with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and
are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character
touching a *talisman of reluctant wishes* must make a DC 15
Charisma check.

If the check fails, the talisman acts as a *[stone of weight]*.
Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character
and the disappearance of the talisman.

If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character
for 5d6 hours, or until a *[wish]* is made with it, whichever
comes first. It then disappears.

If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a
number of months equal to the character's Charisma score,
resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the
character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his
pack, or the like.

The artifact grants one *[wish]* for every 6 points of the
character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs
whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or
magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and
pulses are of no avail.)

Regardless of which reaction results, a *talisman of reluctant
wishes* disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large
diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the
character's Charisma.

**Destruction**

A *talisman of reluctant wishes* can be destroyed by wishing it
so, using either one of the stone's *wishes* or a *[wish]* spell
from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points
of damage to the holder.

These rings follow the normal rules for magic rings as described
in the *PF RPG Core Rulebook*.

**Dungeon Ring**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 8th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 16,000 gp (*jailer's ring*), 250 gp
(*prisoner's ring*); **Weight** —

**Description**

A *jailer's [dungeon ring]* is worked gold, set with a
carnelian. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron
*prisoner's dungeon rings*. When the wearer of a *jailer's ring*
places a *prisoner's ring* on a subject, the prisoner cannot
remove the ring without the use of a *[remove curse]*, *[limited
wish]*, *[miracle]*, or *[wish]* spell. The wearer of the
*jailer's ring* can also remove a linked *prisoner's ring* at any
time.

The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked *prisoner's ring*
like a constant *[status]* spell.  Additionally, all wearers of
linked *prisoner's rings* count as familiar to the jailer for
purposes of spells such as *[scrying]* and *[teleport]*.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [scrying]*, [status]*; **Cost**
*8,000 gp (*jailer's ring*), 125 gp (*prisoner's ring*)

**Ring of Arcane Signets**

**Aura** faint universal; **CL** 1st

**Slot** ring; **Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

The amorphous, approximately 1-inch-square chunk of rosy crystal
that dominates this otherwise plain copper ring forms itself into
a specific rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a
person first puts it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, he
can cause the crystal to adopt any shape he wishes. If the wearer
does not expect this to occur, the crystal instead molds itself
into an image that symbolizes the wearer or some dominant facet
of his personality. Once the crystal assumes this initial form,
it always does so whenever the wearer puts on the ring. The
wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any object
(as if using *[arcane mark]*) simply by pressing the ring against
it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic features
of the image each time he uses the ring. The brand is otherwise
permanent unless removed by *[dispel magic]*, *[erase]*, or a
more powerful spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], *[arcane mark]*; **Cost** 500 gp

**Ring of Delayed Doom**

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 45,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This band has nine garnets embedded along its exterior. Whenever
the wearer's mind or body first becomes subject to any harmful
effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he
may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that
effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw but before
its effects occur. This activation causes one of the garnets to
turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue
to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as
an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys
another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The
delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious,
when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the
ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not
count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that
lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the
wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect
against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is
delayed, for example, *[neutralize poison]* cast on the wearer
while he delays the effect of a poisonous bite removes the poison
effect.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [heal]*, *[time stop]*; **Cost**
*22,500 gp

**Ring of Forcefangs**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 8,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This band negates any force spell or spell-like ability targeted
at the wearer. Doing so gives the ring a number of charges equal
to the spell level of the incoming force effect. The ring can
hold a maximum of nine charges. If an incoming force attack would
charge the ring beyond this limit, the ring does not negate the
attack or gain charges, and the attack affects the wearer
normally. On command, the wearer can use the ring's charges to
cast *[magic missile]*, unleashing one missile (1d4+1 force
damage) per charge but no more than five missiles per round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [Heighten Spell], *[magic
missile]*; **Cost** 4,000 gp

**Ring of Maniacal Devices**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** ring; **Price** 5,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This deceptively precious looking ring grants the wearer a +5
competence bonus on all [Craft] (traps) and [Disable Device]
checks. Even if he has no ranks in these skills, the wearer may
make [Craft] (traps) and [Disable Device] checks as if he were
trained in them.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], *[fox's cunning]*, creator must
have 5 ranks in the relevant skill; **Cost** 2,500 gp

**Ring of Retribution**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 13th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Once per day, the wearer of this charred bone ring may, as an
immediate action, cause it to detonate in a 30-foot-radius burst
that deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If the
wearer is killed by the detonation, all magical equipment he
carries must also save or take fire damage, and all nonmagical
equipment takes this damage with no saving throw. This explosion
never destroys the ring.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], [Quicken Spell], [fireball]*;
***Cost** 7,500 gp

**Ring of Revelation**

**Aura** faint or moderate varied; **CL** 5th (lesser), 7th
(greater), or 11th (superior)

**Slot** ring; **Price** 10,000 gp (lesser), 16,000 gp (greater),
24,000 gp (superior); **Weight** —

**Description**

A *[ring of revelation]* is a divine item attuned to a particular
oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that
mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the
ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as
if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the
appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level
requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a
*[ring of revelation]*(combat healer) is only usable by an oracle
of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle
already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability
with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that
ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if
worn by a non-oracle.

A *lesser [ring of revelation]* contains a revelation that has no
level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th
level. A *greater [ring of revelation]* contains a revelation
that requires the oracle to be 7th level or higher. A *superior
[ring of revelation]* contains a revelation that requires the
oracle to be 11th level or higher.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring], creator must be an oracle with the
desired revelation; **Cost** 5,000 gp (lesser), 8,000 gp
(greater), 12,000 gp (superior)

  : Table: Rods

Rods are scepter-like devices that have unique magical powers and
do not usually have charges. Many have unique control over the
flow of magic.  Anyone can use a rod (though metamagic rods have
no effect when used by creatures that cannot cast spells). Normal
metamagic rods can be used with spells of 6th level or
lower. Lesser rods can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower,
while greater rods can be used with spells of 9th level or lower.

^1^Add to the enhancement bonus on [Table: Weapons] to determine
total market price.

^2^Bows, crossbows, and slings crafted with this ability bestow
this power upon their ammunition.

^3^Reroll if you get a duplicate special ability, an ability
incompatible with an ability that you've already rolled, or if
the extra ability puts you over the +10 limit. A weapon's
enhancement bonus and special ability bonus equivilents can't
total more than +10.

A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1
enhancement bonus.

**Allying**: An *[allying] weapon* allows the wielder to transfer
some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to one weapon being
used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of
sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her
turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate
her weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon
lasts until the *[allying] weapon*'s wielder's next turn. The
enhancement bonus from the *[allying] weapon* does not stack with
the enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[magic weapon]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Conductive**: A conductive weapon is able to channel the energy
of a spell-like or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or
ranged touch attack to hit its target (such as from a cleric's
domain granted power, sorcerer's bloodline power, oracle's
mystery revelation, or wizard's arcane school power). When the
wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may
choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it
through the weapon to the struck opponent, who takes the effects
of the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has
unlimited uses of a special ability, he may channel through the
weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead
opponent with her *[conductive] greatsword*can expend two uses of
lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal
greatsword damage and damage from one use of her lay on
hands. This weapon property can only be used once per round, and
only works with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon
(melee or ranged).

Moderate necromancy; CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[spectral hand]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Corrosive**: Upon command, a *[corrosive] weapon* becomes slick
with acid that deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage on a
successful hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. The effect
remains until another command is given.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[acid
arrow]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Corrosive Burst**: A corrosive burst weapon functions as a
corrosive weapon that explodes with acid upon striking a
successful critical hit.  The acid does not harm the wielder. In
addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive ability, a
*[corrosive burst] weapon* deals an extra 1d10 points of acid
damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical
modifier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead,
and if the modifier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.

Even if the *[corrosive]*ability is not active, the weapon still
deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 12th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[acid
arrow]*; Price +2 bonus.

**Cunning**: This special ability allows a weapon to find chinks
in a foe's defenses using the wielder's knowledge of the
target. Whenever the weapon's attack is a critical threat, the
wielder gains a +2 bonus on the confirmation roll if she has 5 or
more ranks in the [Knowledge] skill related to the target's
creature type (such as [Knowledge] [planes] for an outsider
opponent).

Moderate divination; CL 6th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[true
strike]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Dueling**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A
dueling weapon (which must be a weapon that can be used with the
[Weapon Finesse] feat) gives the wielder a +4 enhancement bonus
on initiative checks, provided the weapon is drawn and in hand
when the Initiative check is made. It provides a +2 bonus on
disarm checks and feint checks, a +2 bonus to CMD to resist
disarm attempts, and a +2 to the DC to perform a feint against
the wielder.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[cat's grace]*; Price +14,000 gp.

**Furious**: This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A
*[furious] weapon* serves as a focus for its wielder's anger.
*When the wielder is raging or under the effect of a [rage]*
*spell, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than
*normal. If the wielder has a rage power that gives a skill bonus
*while raging (such as raging climber, raging leaper, or raging
*swimmer), the wielder gains an enhancement bonus to that skill
*whenever the weapon is wielded or held in hand, even when not
*raging; this bonus is equal to the enhancement bonus of the
*weapon (including the +2 when the wielder is raging).

Moderate enchantment (compulsion); CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and
Armor], rage; Price +1 bonus.

**Grayflame**: This weapon responds to channeled positive or
negative energy. When the wielder spends a swift action to
channel energy through the weapon, it ignites with a strange gray
flame that sheds light as a torch, increases the weapon's
enhancement bonus by +1, and deals +1d6 damage (as the divine
power from *[flame strike]*) to creatures struck by the
weapon. This flame lasts for 1 round for every d6 damage or
healing the channeling normally provides. When charged with
positive energy, the flame is a silvery gray, good creatures are
immune to the weapon's extra damage, and the weapon counts as a
good and silver weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage
reduction. When charged with negative energy, the flame is an
ashen gray, evil creatures are immune to the weapon's extra
damage, and the weapon counts as an evil and cold iron weapon for
the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.

Moderate transmutation; CL 6th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
[Channel Smite], *[align weapon]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Huntsman**: A huntsman weapon helps its wielder locate and
capture quarry. When the weapon is held in hand, the wielder
gains an enhancement bonus on [Survival] checks made to track any
creature the weapon has damaged in the past day. It deals +1d6
damage to creatures the wielder has tracked with [Survival] in
the past day.

Moderate divination; CL 7th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[detect animals or plants]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Jurist**: When an inquisitor wielder uses her judgment class
ability, this weapon grants her an enhancement bonus on her
[Perception] checks and CMD.  The bonus is +1 on the first round
of her judgment, and increases by +1 each round, to a maximum of
+3 on the third and following rounds.

Moderate transmutation; CL 4th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[owl's wisdom]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Menacing**: This ability can only be placed on a melee
weapon. This weapon property helps allies deal with flanked
foes. When the wielder is adjacent to a creature that is being
flanked by an ally, the flanking bonus on attack rolls for all
flanking allies increases by +2. This ability works even if the
wielder is not one of the characters flanking the creature.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[phantasmal killer]*; Price +1 bonus.

**Transformative**: This ability can only be placed on a melee
*weapon. A [transformative] weapon* alters its shape at its
*wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same
*general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as
*simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium
*[transformative] longsword* can take the shape of any other
*Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or
*trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such
*as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even
*take the shape of comparable weapons of different size
*categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed
*slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed
*slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to
*a Medium longsword; a Small [transformative] greatsword* can
*become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature
*without the -2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The
*weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement
*bonuses and weapon properties, except those prohibited by its
*current shape. For example, a [keen] [transformative] weapon*
*functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon,
*but cannot use the [keen]* property when in the shape of a
*bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its
*true shape.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor],
*[major creation]*; Price +10,000 gp.

**Beaststrike Club**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th

**Slot** none; **Price** 7,300 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 club* is often decorated with large teeth and carved
with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action,
the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an
animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of
damage changes to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing),
claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting
(piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club
counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the
purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either
manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the
natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and
spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as [Weapon
Focus] (bite) or the *[bloody claws]* spell. If the wielder has
the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wild shape to
increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that
wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the
weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage
is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club
reverts to its normal shape.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [shillelagh]*;
***Cost** 3,800 gp

**Blade of Binding**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 12,350 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 greatsword* is decorated with a chain motif. On a
successful hit with the sword against a creature of the wielder's
size or smaller creature, the wielder can attempt to start a
grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of
opportunity. If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword
blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps around the target,
giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple checks against
the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder
decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts
to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).

The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling
or pinning the target; if so, the chain remains in place and the
target gains the entangled condition ([Escape Artist] DC 20 to
slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration
DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab
the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to
sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound
creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form and
the weapon gains the broken condition.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[animate rope]*;
  **Cost** 6,350 gp

**Boulderhead Mace**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 6,812 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

**Description**

The head of this *+1 heavy mace* is made from a single piece of
roughly spherical granite. Once per day the wielder can command
the mace to release this head, which grows to the size of a Large
boulder and rolls quickly in a direction the wielder
specifies. The boulder rolls in a straight line up to 60 feet,
trampling everything in its path for 3d8+5 damage (Reflex half DC
19). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its
path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or
roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain. A
new stone mace-head grows on the weapon's haft over the next 24
hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the head regrows.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[wall of stone]*;
  **Cost** 3,652 gp

**Dustburst Bullet**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 196 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This gritty and irregular *+1 sling bullet*explodes into a cloud
of choking dust when it successfully strikes its target. This
fills a 5-foot cube and follows the target for 1d6 rounds before
dispersing. Any creature ending its turn in the cloud must make a
DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened and blinded for 1 round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[stinking
  cloud]*; **Cost** 98 gp

**Guarding Blade**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** none; **Price** 65,310 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [dancing] short sword* automatically rises up to defend
a fallen or sleeping wielder. To trigger the sword's activation,
the wielder must fall unconscious or die while wielding the
weapon or holding it in hand. Thereafter, should any creature
other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike him
with melee attacks, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4
rounds. After 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's
square. Unless the *[guarding blade]* is an intelligent item, it
lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the best opponent
to attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking
the wielder it tends to select a random target each round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[animate
objects]*, *[mage's faithful hound]*; **Cost** 32,810 gp

**Lance of Jousting**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 4,310 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This ornately designed *+1 lance* streams with ribbons and small
favors, allowing a wielder to more effectively knock an opponent
from his mount.  A successful hit with a *[lance of jousting]* on
a mounted opponent forces the target to make a [Ride] check (DC
10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the
saddle. Although used in combat to remove a mounted foe's
advantage, use of a *[lance of jousting]* in a tournament or
similar contest is generally considered a dishonorable form of
cheating.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[bull's
strength]*; **Cost** 2,105 gp

**Ricochet Hammer**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 20,301 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [returning] [light] hammer* can strike multiple foes
with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a
high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds
off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for
each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each
target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties
apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the
hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one
range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it
to a attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from
the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range
penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a
target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting and has no further
attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the
*[returning]* property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated
as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll
(such as *[true strike]*) only apply to the first attack and not
the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's
additional attacks for that round.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [telekinesis]*;
***Cost** 10,301 gp

**Shieldsplitter Lance**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 18,310; **Weight** 10 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 [keen] lance* has the ability to penetrate and destroy
shields. Whenever its wielder uses it to successfully strike an
opponent who carries a shield, the opponent's shield takes the
same damage as the opponent. If the wielder uses the lance to
make a sunder attack against a shield, it bypasses the shield's
hardness.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[keen edge]*,
*[shatter]*; **Cost** 9,310 gp

**Searing Arrow**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,516 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This *+1 [flaming] arrow* continues to burn its target each
round, dealing 1d6 fire damage on the attacker's turn for the
next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow requires a DC 10 [Heal] check
and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases
to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from
himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it burns up once
the 3 rounds pass.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[flame blade]*,
**[flame strike]*, or [fireball]*; **Cost** 758 gp

**Sizzling Arrow**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,516 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This *+1 [corrosive] arrow* continues to leak acid onto its
target each round, dealing 1d6 acid damage on the attacker's turn
for the next 3 rounds. Removing the arrow is a DC 10 [Heal] check
and prevents any further damage from the arrow (the DC increases
to 15 if the target tries to remove the arrow from
himself). Removing the arrow destroys it, and it dissolves up
once the 3 rounds pass.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[acid arrow]*;
  **Cost** 758 gp

**Sparkwake Starknife**

**Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 8th

**Slot** none; **Price** 21,324 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

A faint trail of sparks marks the passage of this *+1 [shock]
starknife* whenever it is thrown. Once per day its wielder may
throw it so it transforms into an 8d6 *[lightning bolt]* (Reflex
DC 14 half), returning to its physical form at the end of the
bolt's path.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[lightning
bolt]*; **Cost** 10,824 gp

**Spirit Blade**

**Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 48,502 gp; **Weight** 1 lbs.

**Description**

This almost transparently thin weapon is often decorated with
strange faces and swirling mist. In addition to being a *+3
[ghost touch] dagger*, it can cast *[dispel magic]* once per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[dispel magic]*,
*[plane shift]*, creator must be 9th level; **Cost** 24,402 gp

**Tangle Bolt**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Price** 226 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Often etched with images of spider webs or swampy vines, this
sickly green *+1 [seeking] bolt* transforms into sticky goo when
it hits, entangling its target and becoming tough and resilient
upon exposure to air. In addition to the bolt damage, the target
is entangled as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], *[true seeing]*
*and [web]* or creator must have 5 ranks in [Craft] (alchemy);
***Cost** 113 gp

**Trident of Stability**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 9,815 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

The base of this sturdy but tarnished *+1 trident* has a wide
metal bar at the bottom, perfectly situated to serve as a solid
footrest or other sort of handle. The bar acts as an *[immovable
rod]*, except instead of an activation button, the immobility
power triggers whenever the wielder places one or both feet on
the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no longer touching the
bar with at least one foot. If the wielder remains in place and
steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when trying to
resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered
braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is
falling, he may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt
his fall, though the sudden jolt means he takes falling damage
for the current distance fallen.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [levitate]*;
***Cost** 5,065 gp

**Undercutting Axe**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 23,310 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

**Description**

This *+1 giant-bane battleaxe* feels unusually heavy, as if it
were made from something far heavier than mere wood and
steel. Once per day its wearer can, as a swift action after a
successful attack roll, invoke a maximized *[ray of
enfeeblement]* on the creature struck (11 point Strength penalty,
7 rounds, Fortitude DC 16 for half).

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor], [Maximize Spell],
**[ray of enfeeblement]*, [summon monster I]*; *Cost** 11,810 gp

# Wondrous Items

Wondrous items is a catchall category for anything that doesn't
fall into the other groups of magic items. Any creature can use a
wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description,
such as requiring a particular class feature).

**All Tools Vest**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

The stitching along the many pockets of this light leather vest
depicts cheerful laborers going about their daily work. Once per
day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak its command word
and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to
make checks for any one [Craft] skill. These tools appear in the
countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on
a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that
appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until
another creature touches them, whichever comes first.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item], *[Summon Instrument]*;
**Cost** 900 gp

**Amulet of Magecraft**

**Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 9th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 20,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

Each silver link that makes up this heavy necklace represents a
well-known concept of arcane theory. A universalist wizard who
selects the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an
amulet) may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares
spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any
prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell
of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same
level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the
wizard chose “evocation” when he prepared his spells that
morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can
spontaneously convert a prepared *[fireball]* into any other
evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item], [Permanency]*, creator
*must be a universalist; **Cost** 10,000 gp

**Amulet of Spell Cunning**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This silver locket only has power when used as a wizard's bonded
object.  It allows a wizard to prepare an additional 3 levels of
spells per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item], *[Mnemonic Enhancer]*;
**Cost** 5,000 gp

**Annihilation Spectacles**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** eyes; **Price** 25,000 gp; **Weight** 1/4 lb.

**Description**

Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes
seem, ever so briefly, to flicker in and out of existence. A
transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any
prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard
transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the
same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may
use the spectacles to spontaneously cast *[disintegrate]* in
place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th
level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item], *[Disintegrate]*, creator
must be a transmuter; **Cost** 12,500 gp

**Apple of Eternal Sleep**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,500 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This beautiful, ripe red apple appears fresh and tempting. Should
anyone bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an
immediate DC 19 Will saving throw or be stricken by [eternal
sleep], the same as the witch's hex of that name. The victim can
only be awakened by a casting of *[Break Enchantment]*, *[Limited
Wish]*, *[Wish]*, or *[Miracle]*, or by a kiss from someone of
royal blood.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Brew Potion], [Craft Wondrous Item], eternal
sleep hex; **Cost** 1,125 gp

**Assisting Glove**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 1st

**Slot** hands; **Price** 180 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The wearer of this simple glove can speak a command word to
transform it into a glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action,
the wearer can have the glove assist him with a task as if using
the aid another action; the glove uses the wearer's base attack
bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another
is successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer's
ability scores or other bonuses). The hand remains until it has
attempted one action or until 1 minute passes, whichever comes
first, at which time it becomes a nonmagical lambskin glove.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item], *[mage hand]*, *[unseen
**servant]*; Cost** 90 gp

**Bandages of Rapid Recovery**

**Aura** faint conjuration (healing); **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the
feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less
natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers
from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete
bed rest regardless of activity (*PF RPG Core
Rulebook*191). A creature actually receiving long-term care (from
the [Heal] skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages
gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when
determining how many hit points it recovers each day. The
bandages are destroyed once removed or when the wearer recovers
all hit points and ability damage, whichever comes first.

Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific
sort of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain
class feature (jungle, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the

stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become
substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the

This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step
its owner takes. The wearer can, as a swift action, order the
cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him
on all sides.  The field grants the wearer a concealment (20%
miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or
until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of

A *cauldron of brewing* looks like a fine cooking pot with four
stout legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid placed
in it to a precise temperature (anywhere from just above room

**Description**

This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids to stand
in comfortably. Upon command, the cauldron and up to 500 pounds
of additional weight can fly as if using *[overland flight]*. The
cauldron moves under the direction of the person who spoke the
activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity,
but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place
without the need for a [Fly] skill check. The cauldron provides

**Description**

The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a
monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium
creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain
rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside
it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if from a
*[raise dead]* or *[resurrection]* spell.  The spell effect
depends on the components used: *[raise dead]* costs 5,000 gp
worth of materials, while *[resurrection]* costs 10,000 gp worth
of materials. The cauldron can function once per day.

This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a
single Medium creature. When filled with a mixture of water and
rare herbs, the cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it
into a zombie as if animated by an *[animate dead]* spell. Each
corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the
cauldron can animate one corpse per round. The user of the
cauldron commands the undead so created—up to 12 HD, unless the
user can cast the *[animate dead]* spell, in which case that
spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes
earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.

**Description**

This delicate tin music box can produce a great volume of noise
at a specific time determined by its owner. Four command words
determine what sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire,
massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere
from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the
desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40
people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.

the bearer has the artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of
damage to her channel energy result when repairing constructs and
objects.

**Slot** shoulders; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the
wearer's entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his
face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to
directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will
save to do so (as the *[sanctuary]* spell). The wearer cannot see
or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively
blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The
wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.

**Description**

A simple cotton cord holds this glittering prism in place. A
person with the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of
this energy into the crystal, which stores it until the wearer
speaks a command word to release it. Releasing the energy targets
the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by
the person who infused the crystal with its power. The crystal
can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When
filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white
light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its
energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving
the lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into
the crystal, including any mercies they had at the time.

**Slot** none; **Price** 800 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one
Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray
fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to
wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the
affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain
made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were
normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined
vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type
that target someone protected by *defoliant polish* with a
natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each
successful attack.

a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this
item has the bardic performance class feature he can use it to

normally have access to that ability. A bard who can use dirge of
doom and who plays the harp as part of his performance increases
the effective radius to 60 feet.

**Description**

A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact
with any one item or object as if she had successfully used the
[Use Magic Device] skill to emulate a class feature or race (if
the exact result of the check matters, treat the character's
result as a 25). If the user of the dust does not mentally select
the intended item or object while coating herself with the dust,
the magic of the dust applies to the first eligible object she
encounters. She can apply the result of this automatic check when
dealing with the item or object for 1 hour after exposure to the
dust.

action, press it against any surface or object and cause a
luminous handprint to appear. This print glows with any color the

**Description**

Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits
an eerie, heart-lurching moan when sounded. A person with the
favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard
action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4
rounds (DC 13 Will save negates).  Creatures suffer a penalty on
this save equal to the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that
type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect;
creatures that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic. The
horn's magic works once per day.

seem more like an enormous pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once
each day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class

full favored enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single
target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The

**Key of Lock Jamming**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 400 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Description**

This ornate brass key automatically reshapes itself to fit any
standard keyhole (generally those in doors scaled for use by
Small or Medium creatures, not deliberately oversized locks like
the main door to a dwarven fortress). Once placed inside a lock,
the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within
it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to
unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key
strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, 8 to
its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC. Touching the key and
speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate, leaving
the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again.

ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed
on a 20). If the check is successful, the monk regains 1 *ki*
point.

**Description**

A *lord's banner* is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least
2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that
size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm,
frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or
when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or
heraldic symbol of a particular noble.

A *lord's banner* may be carried (on foot or mounted) or
planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer,
but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its
effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its
owner.

*Crusades*: A noble-looking *lord's banner of crusades* emits a
*[hallow]* effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is
*borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is
*on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol
*or other religious insignia worked into the design). The banner
*displays the faith's holy symbol along with the owner's crest.

*Swiftness*: A group or army that are traveling under a *lord's
banner of swiftness* can make a forced march without needing
Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing
so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving
ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures
within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least
once a day.

*Terror*: Enemies of the bearer of a *lord's banner of terror*,
while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will
saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as
possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that
succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving
throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 1 day.

*Victory*: Allies of the owner of a *lord's banner of victory*
gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks
for as long as they can see the banner.

mask of giants* are ogre, troll, fire giant, frost giant, or
stone giant. If the form has any of the following abilities, the
wearer gains the listed ability: darkvision 60 feet, low-light
vision, scent. In giant form, the wearer gains a +4 size bonus to
Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +1 natural armor
bonus.

A *greater mask of giants* has all the powers of a lesser mask,
plus additional abilities in giant form. If the form has any of
the following abilities, the wearer gains the listed ability:
rend (2d6 damage), regeneration 5 (acid or fire), rock catching,
rock throwing (range 60 feet, 2d6 damage). If the chosen giant
form has immunity or resistance to any energy type, the wearer

**Moon Circlet**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 15th

**Slot** headband; **Price** 20,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This fine silver circlet typically has a carved moonstone inset
on the front or a crescent moon design. The wearer of a *moon
circlet* gains darkvision out to 60 feet (if she does not already
possess it). Its other effects only benefit a wearer capable of
casting arcane spells.

During the waxing moon, the wearer's caster level is considered
one higher for purposes of caster level checks and spell effects;
during the three nights of the full moon, this benefit increases
to two levels higher than normal. However, this additional power
comes with a price.  During the waning moon, the wearer's caster
level is considered one lower for purposes of caster level checks
and spell effects, and during the three nights of the new moon,
this penalty increases to two levels lower.

Removing a *moon circlet* imposes 2 negative levels on the wearer
until the next full moon (or until the *circlet* is worn again,
whichever comes first). These negative levels cannot be restored
by any means short of a *[limited wish]*, *[wish]*, or
*[miracle]*.
