				<p>When you consume this extract, you quickly consume another extract of your choice&mdash;this second extract's effects do not come into effect until a later point. You must consume this second, companion extract on the round following <i><a href="#delayed-consumption" >delayed consumption</a></i> or waste the extract. The companion extract can be no higher than 4th level, and you must pay any costs associated with the companion extract when you consume it. </p>
				<p>At any point during the duration of this extract, you can cause the companion extract to take effect as an immediate action. You can only have one <i><a href="#delayed-consumption" >delayed consumption</a></i> in effect at one time. If a second is consumed, the first is dispelled without any effect.</p>
